{"The New York Trilogy: City of Glass / Ghosts / The Locked Room": {"average_rating": "3.92", "review": [["First, a brief harangue. I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again. 'In three variants on the classic detective story, Paul Auster makes the well-traversed terrain of New York city his own, as it becomes a strange, compelling landscape in which identities merge or fade and questions serve only to further obscure the truth.'I stayed on in the house for a few more days. My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place. Fanshawe was there, and no matter how hard I tried not to think of him, I couldn't escape. This was unexpected, galling. Now that I had stopped looking for him, he was more present to me than ever before. The whole process had been reversed.

I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again. 'In three variants on the classic detective story, Paul Auster makes the well-traversed terrain of New York city his own, as it becomes a strange, compelling landscape in which identities merge or fade and questions serve only to further obscure the truth.'I stayed on in the house for a few more days. My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place.

His poems are well-made and he should be very proud of them. Auster says himself (and is quoted in the introduction) that these artifacts may be seen down the road as his very best work. I was not so enamored with his translations, but I don't think it had anything to do at all with the work Auster did on them. It was important for me to read these poems and I am more impressed with Auster than before. It has enabled a clearer understanding I would not have had otherwise. I don't know of many writers who successfully write poetry, fiction, and essays as well as Auster does. Hard to do all these well. Generally we need to stick with what works best, but Auster is proof that sometimes we just don't know. Glad he had the courage to try other things than poetry. We are all better for it. I really cannot tell you what any of his poems mean, but there is something about them that stays with you, which is good enough for me."], ["We dreamthat we do not dream. We wakein the hours of sleepand sleep through the silencethat stands over us. Summerkeeps its promiseby breaking it.- Dictum: After Great DistancesThere's a reason Paul Auster is known for his fiction and not his poetry. Like many writers before him, Auster started in poetry but abandoned the vocation after the success of his \nNew York Trilogy\n. Having read both, I would sooner recommend his fiction, particularly The New York Trilogy.Anyone curious about Auster's poetry may be interested to know that there are inklings of his fiction, certain tonal and thematic elements that foreshadow the subjects he would later explore in his novels. The prose poem \"White Spaces\" reads, at times, like the speech given by Peter Stillman in City of Glass:It comes from my voice. But that does not mean these words willever be what happens. It comes and goes. If I happen to bespeaking at this moment, it is only because I hope to find a wayof going along, and so begin to find a way of filling the silence withoutbreaking it.My favourite poems in the collection weren't written by Auster. They are poems by the French Surrealists (Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, Robert Desnos, etc.) translated by Auster. The reason being that Auster doesn't have a strong voice in poetry, and therefore does not impose upon the style of the writer he is translating.Overall recommendation: Skip the poetry and read the fiction."], ["Prima werk, maar had er op basis van Austers proza - dat gewoon goed tot heel goed is - toch wat meer verwacht.

That seems fitting for this complete collection of Paul Auster's published poetry, because Auster's subject is the difficulty of translating experience into words. For the last 35 years, Auster has written novels, nonfiction essays, and screenplays and directed a few films, but in the 1970s, he wrote poetry. This book collects all the poems, notes from his sketchbook, his late-'60s translations of French poets, and the 1979 piece, WHITE SPACES, that marked his transition from poetry to prose. That piece, a strange combination of the two mediums written after seeing a dance troupe rehearsal, seems, in its own quiet way, like the summation of Auster's obsessions. His poetry is specifically about the difficulty of describing experience, but can be generally applied to any artistic medium or maybe even any human transaction or interaction relying on language. Some key lines, for me: \"The world is in my head. My body is in the world.\" \"The eye does not will what enters it: it must always refuse to refuse.\" \"The world that walks inside me is a world beyond reach.\" \"The tongue is forever taking us away from where we are, and nowhere can we be at rest in the things we are given to see, for each word is an elsewhere, a thing that moves more quickly than the eye, even as this sparrow moves, veering into the air in which it has no home.\" \"The world is my idea. I am the world. The world is your idea. You are the world. My world and your world are not the same.\" \"... our perceptions are necessarily limited. Which means that the world has a limit, that it stops somewhere. But where it stops for me is not necessarily where it stops for you.\""], ["As a Auster artistic advocate I've read his ten (twelve)novels and his nonfiction The Invention of Solitude and The Red Notebook. As a novelist and poet myself, I felt an obligation to attempt Auster's poetry.Collected Poems spans a decade of poetry (1970-79)and a few translated French poems of his earlier work as a bonus. From the get-go I can say that his fluid novel and non fiction prose found contrasts with sometimes awkward, soul-searching poetic moments. Yet his mastery of language, intelligence and depth are found a every corner and hidden in the nooks and crannies of hazy inspirations and expirations.The poetic journey is steady and always requires your attention and your creativity, Interpretation is never easy and you feel that you are always missing something try as you may - a bit like life in fact. Unfortunately this may be a bit too alienating to most and even if there are indeniable insights and artistic prouesses, the lack of clear cohesion and inutive innovation make it hard to relate or correlate.As you read through you get used to the awkwardness, yet you do not find the key or the epiphany of some work that reveal themselves as you go. Rather you are melancholic and find \"Facing the Music\" not quite melodic. This cacophony cackles with brilliance, but is left mostly in the shady shadows. Only when we reach the \"White Spaces (1979)\" which is a cross between poetry and introspectic nonfiction to we see the great Auster emerge.An interesting exploration, but no clear findings.As for the French poetry it is neither here nor there, just gliding.Auster is a master, but here he is in becoming.

As with most of his work, mystery and logic interplay with a stark yet remarkably lyrical style. He has a sharp and clear vision of topics, issues, and events with complex, myriad layers of emotion and meaning as if he were a \"puzzle master\" of the human experience. Auster plays with the theme of chance vs. fate--which pervades his later work--early in this volume, so it was fascinating to see the origins of his obsession--and the genesis of his singular style--unveiled in his early work. Note: Please read introduction first, as it covers key events in the author's life--and the soci-political climate of the 60's--that had a long term and significant impact on his work and the evolution of his career. Reading about his deep knowledge of philosophy also helped me re-examine my own fascination with his work. While many of his poems address haunting issues, images of vast emptiness, inner wards, and inexplicable \"disappearances,\" he also explores deep yearnings for--and questions about--love. If you haven't read his novels, you may want to start with the stunning New York Trilogy, a triptych of 3 novellas that are masterfully inter-related."], ["Deeply philosophical, I liked the later poems better than the earlier ones. All of them show a clear French influence, and though they are often intriguing, I found it hard to connect emotionally with Auster's poetry, in contrast to both his fiction and his memoirs. There's surreal imagery here, and a constant struggle to voice what Auster feels cannot truly be voiced. The end result was that I felt suspended in a dreamlike but frustrated state while reading these and afterwards, isolated and observant but bereft of any deep feeling of satisfaction or real connection. And that, perhaps, was the point of many of these poems: to get the reader to acknowledge his own world, limited and limiting and ultimately unsayable."], ["Magn\u00edfico.

As we know it's about that JFK thing. The whole thing, all of it. So yes, this is the ur-conspiracy we are dealing with, which all the other conspiracies use as the template. Given my well-advertised detestation of all things conspiracytheoretical, you might think I would want to give Libra the widest of berths. Being a contrarian means I couldn't. I take contrary opinions to myself too. I had to pay my dues. I had to stare the god damned conspiracy in its jowles, I had to rummage in its belly and pick over what it ate last night, ugh, all its grimy details, its filthy postulates and its mind-damaging Agatha-Christie's-Murder-on-the-Orient-Express conclusion that - gasp, look away now - they ALL did it!So I looked and stared and rummaged and poked and turned affadavits over in my hand and ran the tape found in the camera up Marilyn Monroe's backside, all of that.

En Libra DeLillo propone que el asesino \u00aboficial\u00bb del presidente Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, solo fue la cara visible de una conspiraci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s grande y enrevesada, fundada desde el mismo coraz\u00f3n de los EE. UU., a partir de una decisi\u00f3n que muchos consideran un error de Kennedy, durante una invasi\u00f3n a Cuba (en la operaci\u00f3n conocida como Bay of Pigs del 61) para derrocar a Fidel Castro. Por supuesto que Libra no necesariamente condice con lo que realmente piensa DeLillo (al menos no con exactitud), incluso ya lo ha hecho expl\u00edcito en varias ocasiones, pero siempre es interesante llegar con literatura a lugares imposibles de la vida real.Leyendo rese\u00f1as de otros usuarios, me encontr\u00e9 con personas a las que les pas\u00f3 lo mismo que a m\u00ed: este DeLillo de Libra no es el mismo que el DeLillo de, por ejemplo, White Noise. DeLillo es intensamente criticado por su modo de escribir, sus tramas insulsas y sus personajes planos y de cart\u00f3n; sin embargo, en Libra queda claro que DeLillo es un grand\u00edsimo escritor, y no solo su modo de narrar es extraordinario, sino que es un escritor que se adapta. En White Noise, DeLillo utiliz\u00f3 una narraci\u00f3n muy vac\u00eda y sin mucho cuerpo precisamente porque a aquello iba su libro, a criticar la deshumanizaci\u00f3n de la sociedad debido al consumismo desalmado. En Libra, la escritura de DeLillo adquiere un tono mucho m\u00e1s fragmentado, hasta asfixiante. En casi ning\u00fan momento el lector tiene plena constancia de lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo y de qui\u00e9n es cada personaje, como Nicholas Branch, entre datos solitarios que se juntan en coincidencias incognoscibles que alimentan la paranoia. Y para volver m\u00e1s desesperantes las cosas, quiebra la narraci\u00f3n con frases que parecen salidas de la nada y aun as\u00ed, de alguna forma, se sienten en armon\u00eda con lo que estabas leyendo. DeLillo juega con cambios de tiempo aleatorios y sin previo aviso, di\u00e1logos entre personajes que le hablan al aire, dentro de un soliloquio cortado por otras voces en el fondo y a las que tambi\u00e9n se debe escuchar, y todo este caos crea un clima que absorbe al lector en la misma conspiraci\u00f3n. Pero principalmente quiero resaltar el aspecto que, en mi opini\u00f3n, es el m\u00e1s valioso de Libra. DeLillo ha sabido establecer personajes tan complejos y tan bien desplegados que hasta asustan de su tridimensionalidad. DeLillo bebi\u00f3 de personas reales y las represent\u00f3 en papel sin casi perder su condici\u00f3n de reales. Se apoder\u00f3 de Lee Oswald y lo encaj\u00f3 en literatura, en un Coming of Age tr\u00e1gico y plagado de malas influencias que hace que se llegue a sentir una clase de apego por Oswald, quiz\u00e1 l\u00e1stima. Porque a eso va DeLillo, la verdadera historia se desarrolla detr\u00e1s del tel\u00f3n. Personas como ara\u00f1as en la oscuridad susurr\u00e1ndose entre s\u00ed son las que marcan el inicio de un tiempo y cierran otro. \u00abLa historia se compone de la suma de los elementos que no nos cuentan\u00bb. DeLillo nos explica que la historia se gesta a nuestras espaldas y lo que vemos es solo un breve fragmento perdido del que se agarran los medios y la histeria social para explicar hechos de lo que nunca lograremos saber su verdad. Probablemente jam\u00e1s se forme una segunda Comisi\u00f3n Warren que explique lo que la primera todav\u00eda no puede explicar, seguiremos de este lado de la historia, del lado de la luz, viendo ef\u00edmeras chispas que se escapan de lo que se nos est\u00e1 prohibido observar. Porque as\u00ed debe ser y aqu\u00ed nos ha tocado estar.\u00abCuando est\u00e1s convencido de que has visto todas las formas en que la violencia puede sorprenderte, aparece algo nuevo que ni siquiera hab\u00edas imaginado. \u00bfCon cu\u00e1nta fuerza golpean las balas para alcanzar a un hombre en el pecho y hacer que su sombrero vuele un metro y medio por los aires en l\u00ednea recta?

So an essential DeLillo as long as you have UW under your belt already."], ["a work of bright and ruthless genius, the jfk assassination as recounted by some alien being from the far future. well actually, not really, not at all. well actually, at times it felt like it. is delillo less than human or more than human? the novel makes no attempt to be historically factual. actually, the facts presented are reasonable and sound. the novel is historically factual, as much as anything can be. the narrative is, of course, almost too complex to be detailed. although it is, in its way, a straightforward narrative, straight as an arrow, straight as any history of well-known events could be. conspiracy theories, so many of them, competing with each other, often making complete sense as they are told, only to be collapsed by the next conspiracy theory. the conspiracy theory as just one version of the many-told tale, stories handed down from teller to teller. an interesting conceit. actually, more than that - storytelling is perhaps the point of the whole novel. what is the truth in a story? who is the real person behind the historical personage, behind the character in the story? the novel wonders: can reality ever truly be represented? such a humorous book at times. the jokes are secret jokes, told with a straight face. the deaths are no joke, no joke at all. the novel is dead serious. the death of lee harvey oswald is a harrowing, moving experience, the best sequence of many excellent sequences in the book. the novel is powerful and yet filled with minutiae, with meaningless detail. each detail is packed with meaning. it is a Choose Your Own Adventure, of sorts. astrology is real, it defines us and all of our actions. astrology is an illusion, as is motivation and circumstance and conspiracy and history itself.

Shots in Dallas proved that this an event can not be easily interpreted, it melts in the mist of conjectures and hypotheses and still is a breeding ground for more and more daring conspiracy theories. (I\u2019m not a huge fan of conspiracy theories, neither in books nor in real life. In fact we, in Poland, have enough these ones. People are divided on those who think that Smolensk was tragic plane accident and others who belive that it was a criminal assassination. Sorry for this personal comment). Libra  operates on three plans. The first one it is a story of Lee H. Oswald shown from his childhood in the Bronx, through his service in Japan, his romance with Marxism and stay in the Soviet Union until his death from Jack Ruby\u2019s hand. Oswald is the title \"Libra\", the man full of contradictions, like the zodiacal sign of Libra, you really don\u2019t know what could tip the scales on one or other side. From DeLillo's writing emerges portrait of a man without qualities, somewhat mysterious yet undecidable character - we fail to know what exactly his motivation was.On the second plan we get the conspiratorial activities of the special services and the criminal groups. Here the main roles play retired agents, members of the anti-Castro opposition, anti-communist activists, mafia. Independently of each other are preparing a provocation aimed at Kennedy. And finally, the third thread, which takes place many years after the assassination of Kennedy. The main protagonist here is a CIA analyst buried by Agency with meticulous facts and factual evidence, trying to order them and get to know what really happened in Dallas. Yes, the same DeLillo is doing.Like every tragic and unsolved mystery Kennedy\u2019s assassination became a source of a variety theories trying to get a logical explanation. The picture that DeLillo creates is so unsettling and thought-provoking, and the whole story so coherent and plausible that when we finish our reading, our thinking is and what if that was like that \u2026 ."], ["DeLillo and I are friends now!!We had started off on the wrong foot, but Libra has patched things up. I too share Paul's suspicions about Libra and White Noise having been written by the same person. Had I been handed these two books without the cover, I wouldn't have known those words had flown out of the same figurative pen.Libra is a terrific piece of work. It has a huge cast of characters and a very complex web of events, all handled neatly and elegantly. While DeLillo's characters never really open up to the readers, they can still be haunting and memorable. The writing is very dense and can have a lot of sub-textual meaning. Instead of directly telling the readers what the mood of a scene is or how a character feels, he creates the atmosphere with his words and conveys the feeling quite effectively. Among other things, I liked the way he would give one the sense of slowly or rapidly passing time without saying as much (I have lost my copy, otherwise I could have pulled out a few quotes to show you what I mean. Oh well.) Oswald's mother's neurotic behavior, his wife Marina's feelings of helplessness, dilemmas of many characters are portrayed so well that even minor characters carve a niche for themselves and stay with the reader.Unlike typical thrillers where characters are mere caricatures blindly running after power/money ***, DeLillo's characters are quite real. They do stop long enough to breathe and think. The reader is privy to their objectives, their motivations, their hesitations and dilemmas. Despite knowing how the story is going to end, it is never uninteresting.For me, the most outstanding part of Libra is the realization of the character Lee Harvey Oswald. He is terrifyingly real and complex. He doesn't conform to either hero or anti-hero stencil. I neither like him nor dislike him, but I feel great sympathy for him. His whole life seems to be something of an accident (I mean more accidental than most lives are). It is as if one day he closed his eyes, spun around and then started walking in the direction that he had ended up facing. As a very young teenager, Marxism and communism caught his fancy, without anyone directing him that way. And this very passion acted as his guiding light. What if something else had caught his eye at that stage? He would have been an altogether different person. Though his behavior is far from ideal, he has so many great qualities that could have led him to an exemplary life. He is man of great commitment. He stands by what he believes in and would go to any lengths to support his beliefs. How painstakingly he kept at writing and reading despite his dyslexia is mentioned often in the book. If only....Like Lee's life, the theme of accidental happenings is something DeLillo highlights too. Agent branch trying to solve the confusing maze of the events leading upto JFK assassination finds it impossible to know how much of the history was planned and how much of it was coincidences and destiny. For any scheme to be pulled off, lot of things do need to fall into the right place.I am holding off the fifth star only because political thrillers and conspiracy theories don't hold much interest for me. But Libra really is very impressive.*** I am looking at you American Tabloid. I loved Ellroy's stacatto writing, but it was 600 pages of pretty much the same thing.__________________________________________UPDATE:Libra has been on a long hiatus as I have been occupied with a hundred other things. While I have not been reading this book about JFK's assassination, I did recently happen to drive by the actual location of Kennedy's assassination and the sixth floor museum._____________________________________Second and last chance for DeLillo to impress me. All my GR friends have rated this either 4 or 5 stars (mostly 5). So I am setting my expectations high.If it begins to sound anything like White Noise, it is going straight out of my window.Mr. DeLillo there is a lot of pressure on you. Pull up your socks."], ["\"\nThere's always more to it. This is what history consists of. It is the sum total of things they aren't telling us.\n\"The novel is a tragic, speculative account of the people, places and things leading to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Delillo uses many of the actual words of Oswald and his mom Marguerite, as well as numerous documented facts surrounding the life and times of Lee Harvey Oswald, so that I had difficulty discerning where the public records stop and the fiction begins. This is likely why Delillo takes pains to remind us that his novel makes \"no claim to literal truth\" and that he \"made no attempt to furnish factual answers to any questions raised by the assassination.\"It is significant to note that the several films speculating on Lee Harvey Oswald, a conspiracy and the assassination of JFK, such as Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" from 1991, came after the 1988 publication of Delillo's Libra. Not realizing this, I initially gave the novel only 4 stars when I finished it earlier this year. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am with Delillo's brilliance and imaginative creation.Delillo expertly saves this from being labeled a political novel by his character Nicholas Branch, a researcher who undertakes the nearly impossible task of looking for patterns in a mountain of data and trying distinguish them from mere coincidence. Branch/Delillo concludes that Kennedy's death was the product of a mixture of confederacy and chance, or \"a rambling affair that succeeded in short term mainly due to chance.\" Specifically, Delillo paints Oswald as a lonely and grotesque fringe dweller who becomes the perfect shill for a plot by current and former CIA operatives to take an errant shot at JFK, with the unsuccessful assassination attempt to be blamed on Cuba.To get to the ultimate point, Delillo takes us on a truncated tour through Oswald's life of trying to escape his fate and futilely searching for a place where he could fit in. First and foremost, Lee Harvey spends his life trying to forget that overbearing mother of his, Marguerite, who is both train-wreck compelling and revolting, depicted by Delillo via her unique manner of speech to a judge to whom she provides her list of excuses and complaints for the poverty in which she raised her son and the way he turned out.Then, he is a Marine who, after discharge, defects to Soviet Russia, only to be disappointed in its Westernization and return to the States as a Marxist with a Russian wife. Finally, he sees Cuba as a possible vista.A few things I found uniquely fascinating in this novel. One is the theme of entropy I have seen in other Delillo novels; that is, the fact it's impossible to control people and events pursuant to some type of plan.Second, how Delillo has such an appreciation for the awkward vernacular of professionals, e.g., CIA, and the staccato dialect of the uneducated.Third and most singular is how Delillo shows Oswald as being captivated by media imagery. I cannot help but believe that many of the recent mass murderers also project themselves as being played out in images on living room TV screens. After being shot by Ruby, Oswald imagines how the shot looked on camera. Back in Russia, when he tried to commit suicide just before being expelled, he views his razor slices across his wrist while a violin plays somewhere offstage. Finally, as Lee Harvey fades away, he pans out, watching himself from \"a darkish room, someone's den.\""], ["\u201cFacts are lonely things.\u201d\nAmerican history is profoundly dark in its timeline. From the slaughtering and near genocidal extermination of the Native Americans to the 9/11 attacks, American history presents itself as an almost constant struggle for survival. History has not been so kind when it comes to America. Inevitably, and understandably, it is so very interesting, and the American people are also equally interesting. Their history is internationally relatable due to the ancestral voyages undertaken, and their subjective stories illuminate the overall objectified view of Uncle Sam. Libra refuses to show America from a political, sociological or a generalised historical standpoint. Instead, in Tolstoyan fashion, DeLillo examines the \u2018six seconds that broke the back of the American century\u2019 artistically. Not a single detail is left unnoticed. The scariest part is: What is real? Fact, hypothesis, speculation and fiction are all methodically rolled into one, creating this postmodern odyssey.Libra, an immensely impressive work by American writer Don DeLillo, is one of those books that defines the feeling of America, past, present and future. It\u2019s stylish in its execution, believable in its convictions, thrilling in its story and downright disturbing in its resolution. I remember having these exact feelings whenever I watched the certain episodes of the X-Files\u2014 you know, with governmental corruption, conspiracies and paranoia seeping from every frame. Libra does this, utilising words, and every sentence counts, as he ruthlessly dissects America during the Cold War, leaving the sugarcoating and flag-waving patriotism at the back door.Libra, in all its glory, terrifies the reader with its powerful examination of Lee Harvey Oswald and the events leading up to the assassination of JFK. However, as great as it already is, Libra is so much more than being about Lee Harvey Oswald. DeLillo is reflecting back to America of the 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s, with visually arresting scenes, taking us back to Cold War era as an artistic tool in order to comment on the America of today. Although written in 1988, it still packs a punch that would immediately startle Sonny Liston, with its messages still unsettling us in our post 9/11 world. Don DeLillo isn\u2019t showcasing the past from a politically oriented point of view, as the book is neither conservative or liberal in its underpinnings; instead, it\u2019s a metaphysical shadow, a nameless dread, that looms over these events, seeing it differently from the grounded senses of a human being. It\u2019s a deeply philosophical look, almost epic in scope and as analytical as anything written by Solzhenitsyn. Like I stated earlier, not a single detail is left unnoticed. How DeLillo accomplished this, I will never know.Don DeLillo places Lee Harvey Oswald as the Great Man, the centre of the universe, the Napoleon of the twentieth century, in his quest for remembrance. From the first page, we are instantly dropped into Lee\u2019s world as a young boy, following his upbringing, his discovery of Marxism, political science, Cuba, the military, Japan, Soviet Russia, military espionage and his increasing bitterness of America. DeLillo hurls the facts at breakneck speed and is relentless in his storytelling, blurring fact and fiction so successfully that I refuse to even separate them, fearing I would ruin a work of artistic genius. I cannot describe how I felt when I read the scene with shot down U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers being interrogated by the Russians. This real life incident was recreated perfectly for the book, and sent paranoid shivers up and down my spine. Philip K. Dick was firm in his views on subjective reality. He believed that \u2018objective reality is a synthetic product\u2019. His written thoughts are permanently embedded in my mind: Reality is illusory, fragmented, highly subjective and downright confusing. Everything from the curious eyes of a human being has to be questioned, measured and analysed extensively before contributing to the past, and even then, did it necessarily happen that way? Or has it been a collective agreement to preserve objectivity? So as the story progresses, reality is laid bare, the past is tested and actions are questioned from the viewpoint of DeLillo, disguised as a fictional agent assigned to piecing the past together years after the event. Here the reader is bombarded with an array of information, paranoia, conspiracy and startling insights into the nature of being, time, existence, DeLillo waxing the philosophical with his stark brutality. In postmodern fashion, our senses are shellshocked and we have to do nothing but go along with the ride.\n\u201cHe questions everything, including the basic suppositions we make about our world of light and shadow, solid objects and ordinary sounds, and our ability to measure such things, to determine weight, mass and direction, to see things as they are, recall them clearly, be able to say what happened.\u201d\nEach page has the power to genuinely unsettle the reader. I recall having to close the book many times in order to breath normally again before reopening the pages. The final part is unforgiving and continuously impressive, evoking nostalgia, invoking fear, advocating a sort of coherent truth. Its tension is utterly superb. The paranoia of the Cold War-world will never fail to disturb. Don\u2019t let that put you off though, as Libra is one of the most powerful statements of America ever written.\n\u201cThe truth of the world is exhausting\u2026\u201d"], ["This fucking book, man, it just leaves me at a complete loss for words. I've heard people discredit the terrific work DeLillo did to make Oswald a compelling and complex character - maybe DeLillo's most compelling and most complex character - because Don was working with a real person and therefore had plenty of raw material to go with, but I insist that it takes just as much talent to sculpt what is known of Oswald (his upbringing, his politics, his time in the war) into a real and weirdly relatable anti-hero. DeLillo pulls him out of the realm of history and makes a goddamn person out of him, and all it takes is a maybe-implausible - but certainly, you cannot deny, all sorts of fun to read about - conspiracy to do so. DeLillo uses that conspiracy as a jumping-off point for an in-depth study of Oswald's motivations; his determination to make a mark on history is pulled against by the plot he finds himself wrapped up in, a plot that puts Oswald on strings and pretty much leaves the strings visible. This is what they talk about when they say \"character-driven writing.\"So what does that make Libra? Proof that DeLillo can do character and write in a more traditional mode? Well, it's still DeLillo, so that's not quite the case. Libra may be a character-driven novel, but it's also a thriller, and a thriller in the DeLillo mode, which means he spoofs some thriller conventions (notably the sudden escalations and ridiculously tangled webs of players vs. players), affirm others (the fast pace, the violence, the political undertones), and stay in the DeLillo-space for still others (the paranoia and conspiracies). DeLillo's a smart guy, so it's hard to take this as some YouTube nutjob yelling his head off about the Grassy Knoll and the holes in the Warren Commission, and yet it's equally hard for me to fully buy into DeLillo's disclaimer at the beginning that insists Libra is intended to be pure speculation and isn't supposed to provide any answers. Which I'm sure is the idea, and could even be a little joke on DeLillo's part, since I'm sure he's aware that he's perceived as existing on the brilliant/crazy faultline by his fans and his detractors alike, but it's hard for me to know what to make of this novel, if it was intended as a straight-but-sophisticated historical thriller (I feel Running Dog is more obviously parody, but this isn't Running Dog), even an attempt to legitimatize the genre, or an Eco-style parody of our fascination with the currents of history. It's also hard for me to know if DeLillo honestly believes what he puts out here. I know Kennedy had his enemies and am not naive enough to believe that politicians don't throw other politicians under the bus on the daily, and yet I wonder if this is the ravings of an exceptionally talented lunatic. I know it's an in-depth analysis of the currents of history centered around a fascinating and often demonized figure, but it could also be completely crazy. Or dead the fuck on. Either way, DeLillo's prose is the best it's ever been, the portrayal of Oswald is masterful, and the montage-style climax is out of this world good. Due for a reread."], ["This one took about a month to read so I should respect that time turning its pages and write a few commemorative words. All I can really say is that on every page the writing reeks of literature, but rarely is it literary. What I mean is that DeLillo's sentences always seem to have an eye on a subtextual prize, that is, they always seem like an updated, abstract response to that question posed long ago by some cavedweller about the meaning of life, as opposed to turns of phrase for the sake of well-crafted whateverness. Any given paragraph is obviously DeLillo. His style is absolutely particularly his, but also it's readable and clear, with lyrical potential, too, but never romantic, or sensory solely for the sake of activating the reader's senses. All characters are part of the whole (society, history, the universe), and all characters have been brought to life solely to speak DeLillo's words. This would annoy if DeLillo had nothing to say, but he has some serious things to say, and so his characters say them, then conspire to kill the president. A particular brand of American anxiety is represented here. This is a difficult review to write. What I should just say is that several times while reading this while walking to work I would laugh out loud at awesome language or a turn or development or insight (rarely at something funny, though humor exists if not necessarily abounds) and sometimes I'd even say out loud that this dude is a freakin' great writer. I should be better able to articulate why I'd say this aloud while walking/reading, but I think it has to do with his authority, ambition, dry-eyed humanity, intelligence/wisdom, scope/range, humor, boldness, the beautifully honed/hefty sentences of course, and also something to do with the structure, how scenes emerge and dissolve (\"boldly\" as Ethan says) without much helpful orientation from the author, and it all seems held together loosely, artfully, in a way that seems like it wants to very carefully, very gently create in the reader a state similar to what's being experienced by the characters? Something like that? It's real good. Maybe his masterpiece, even more so than \"Underworld\"? -- it definitely feels longer (maybe 'cause it's denser?) and goes slower than \"Underworld\" . . . Also, plot-wise, the whole time you know how this one ends, but such knowledge is hardly an annoyance, the opposite in fact, same as with re-reading Hamlet etc."]], "review_count": "489", "description": "<b>From the author of <i>White Noise </i>(winner of the National Book Award) and <i>Zero K</i></b><br /><br />In this powerful, eerily convincing fictional speculation on the assassination of <b>John F.

Well, there\u2019s the occasional visit from his girlfriend and members of his rock group and hawkers connected with a Happy Valley Commune yammering about a future miracle drug, enough visits to keep his sharp edge very sharp and enough visits to possibly drive a crazy boy crazy. And here's our man, the one and only Bucky Wunderlick, musing on the mystical nature of his girlfriend and soulmate, the incomparable Opel: \"All she desired was the brute electricity of that sound. To forget everything. To be that sound. That was the only tide she heeded. She wanted to exist as music does, nowhere, beyond the maps of language.\" A batch of reasons why this novel by Don DeLillo is fab:THE BOX MAN, AMERICAN-STYLEWithin months of publication of Great Jones Street another new novel hit the shelves addressing many of the same themes: The Box Man by Nobel winning Japanese novelist, K\u014db\u014d Abe, where the nameless protagonist surrenders his previous identity and conventional routine to live in a large cardboard box he wears over his head. Great Jones Street and The Box Man \u2013 so into yourself, so \u201csociety get out of my face.\u201d At one point in DeLillo\u2019s novel, girlfriend Opel tells Bucky about a new underground counterculture group: \u201cThe return of the private man, according to them, is the only way to destroy the notion of mass man.\u201d Oh, Opel. Oh, Bucky. Oh, Box Man. This is so 70s! Sidebar: I recall watching a 1970s newscast where a university student wore a black cloth over his head down to his shoes and walked around campus calling himself \u201cthe black bag.\u201d Actually, I thought this guy really cool.POETRYAt one point, Bucky reflects: \u201cAlone I lived in the emergency of minutes, in phases of dim compliance with the mind\u2019s turning hand.\u201d And here\u2019s another of his rock-and-roll reveries: \u201cEuphoric with morphine we\u2019d be wheeled among them, noting proportions and contours, admiring the beauty of what we were.\u201d It\u2019s as if Bucky\u2019s words could have been excerpts from Alan Ginsberg\u2019s many page beatnik slam-poem \u201cHowl.\u201d And there are numerous other such Bucky rant-lines for fans of DeLillo\u2019s poetic, philosophic prose. THE WRITER IN THE APARTMENT ABOVE \u201cSome writers presume to be men of letters. I\u2019m a man of numbers.\u201d So says the novelist, essayist, poet, short story writer Fenig, who lives in the apartment on Great Jones Street right above Bucky and who is a writer obsessed with seeking fame and knowing the ups and downs of the writer\u2019s market better than a seasoned stock broker knows Wall Street. Don DeLillo, you sly dog, putting a writer who might be the shadow side of yourself in the apartment above your protagonist. ROCK-AND-ROLL, THE NEW MODERN ARTIn an interview, Bucky pontificates how when people read a book or look at a painting, they just sit there or stand there, but through his music, he makes people move. WOW! The one and only Bucky Wunderlick, shining star, prime mover, kinesthetic force, creator of a new political-erotic-mystical art form that, as sculptor Claes Oldenburg insisted, does more than just sit on its ass in a museum. SOCIAL COMMENTARYAgain, Don DeLillo fans will not be disappointed since many are the zingers hurled at contemporary American society. For example, how TV programs are interrupted and announcers sound close to insanity, their voices soaring, as they report on the impending snowstorm: heavy snow, deep snow, drifting snow, big fluffy white flakes are falling and will continue to fall from the sky. (I myself am always both amused and amazed at the panic snow arouses in the media). And, again: Bucky has issues with his hard-earned money having to work . . . no, no, no, he did the work; he wants his money resting in nice big green stacks in some cool bank vault. He\u2019s told in so many words: so sorry, Bucky, like it or not, your rich ass is tied into the American financial world! BUCKY\u2019S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOURInserted into the first-person narrative is the Superslick Mind-Contracting Media Kit featuring The Bucky Wunderlick Story told in various news clips, song lyrics and Zen-like enigmatic responses to interviewers. All very fitting since Bucky\u2019s words have that ring of rock-and-roll truth, when he states further on in the story, \u201cBeauty is dangerous in narrow times, a knife in the slender neck of the rational man, and only those who live between the layers of these strange days can know its name and shape.\u201d Yea, baby! Hearing such wisdom I have to ask: What\u2019s the sound of one Bucky turning at thirty-three and a third, second cut, side one, third album? THE FIGURATIVE DEATH-IN-LIFE JOURNEYBucky wants us to know his solitary journey on Great Jones Street is only the literal way of looking at things. Figuratively, he tells us, he lived in a remote monastery with the lamas of Tibet, being guided through the mysteries of the highest levels, the most esoteric planes of death. That\u2019s what he came to know. Death-in-life. Oh, how cool is that! Thanks, Don D. You rock!"], ["This is a weird novel, but I kept feeling like this was an older relative of Cosmopolis, and happens in New York like that book, only a couple decades earlier (circa 1971-73, from winter to very early spring). This is DeLillo's third novel, and should, in my opinion, be approached like a movie that flows and doesn't go too strictly from A to B. I mean, some things are left open-ended a bit and the way people talk may read oddly. I did find myself loving the book from around midpoint on.It tells of how a Dylan-Jaggerlike figure of a singer, Bucky Wunderlick (now there's a name!), a skinny, somewhat sarcastic and detached sort of person, finds himself burnt out and decides to leave his band mid-tour, moving to a Great Jones Street apartment in East Village, New York. His desire is just to chill and see when he again feels like popping up and continuing his career, but finds he just won't be left alone. His manager, Globke, wants Bucky's remaining music, the 'Mountain Tapes', wrapped in a package, and various people want another, similar-looking package that comes in his possession, that holds inside a new drug that's quite new in its effect on people. Much confusion is the result, as the packages go wandering.This one day of late rain I saw a toothless man circle a cart banked with glowing produce... the man wailed to the blank windows above him. It was a religious cry he produce, evocative of mosques and quaking sunsets.RED YAPPLES GREEN YAPPLES GOLDEN YAPPLES MAKE A YAPPLE PIE MAKE ALSO A YAPPLE STRUDEL YAPPLES YAPPLES YAPPLES BIG JUICY YAPPLES FROM THE HEART OF THE YAPPLE COUNTRY.There's more important people around that just Bucky, like of course this Globke with his wife, Michelle, who is interest in all things East, like Upanishads. Azarian, the former guitarist of Bucky's band who is considered the 'next-prettiest', a proud but nervous figure with interest in black music. Opel, Bucky's girlfriend with a restless spirit who travels in warm countries like Morocco (a version of Anita Pallenberg perhaps?), who only briefly reappears(view spoiler)[ as she dies pretty soon after quite sudddenly (hide spoiler)]. Various members of a commune called Happy Valley: Skippy, a messenger/drug dealer girl; Bohack, a sort of leader with sometimes homophobic edge; Chess, the keeper of the community's greenery. This commune is very important in regards of the drug plotline.Eddie Fening, a writer that lives upstairs, walking back and forth to be inspired, with various writing ideas and a series of exactly-same looking clothes (and his coffee, tomato soup and crackers). Hanes, Globke's assistant with betrayer's spirit and a feel of desperation. Dr. Pepper, a mysterious figure navigating the crime world, sometimes in disguise, and one who can turn the drug into useful form. Watney, a former musician turned shady business dealer, and a Brit.And we get to see some lyrics of his band's work as well as his Tapes' lyrics - all very, very bad poetry (I mean, their biggest hit is called 'Pee-Pee Maw-Maw'? XD ). I bet they were written bad very intentionally so *cough*You really do get a feel of the apartment: phone stays disconnected for a while (then Bucky likes to listen to the empty tone, and a radio left there likewise), the weather (mostly snow, later also rain), the fewness of the food - the hunt for coffee at one point and Bucky prepares a ready-made noodle soup once, the bathtub, the bubblegum cards left behind in a bag, etc. It all feels wintry and grey, but not despairing, more like observing, peaceful, \"time of prayerful fatigue\". The fire station nearby, the homeless and the drunks and the older people. The underground, the streets and the bus back home. Lots of walking and looking around.In a millennum or two, a seeming paradox of our civilization will be best understood by those men versed in the methods of counter-archeology. They will study us not by digging into the earth but by climbing vast dunes of industrial rubble and mutilated steel, seeking to reach the tops of our buildings. Here they'll chip lovely at our spires, mansards, turrets, parapets, belfries, water tanks, flower pots, pigeon lofts and chimneys...The drug, with its effect of(view spoiler)[ turning off the ability to communicate verbally and be nothing but passive (hide spoiler)] does have something to give to (view spoiler)[Bucky in the end - although he is forced to take the drug to test the effect, as a result he has a good excuse not to go on 'tour' as the Tapes are released. And he can pretend he can't talk even after the effect of the drug goes away, so he can have his peace at his flat. (hide spoiler)] And as I finished the book, leaving Great Jones Street behind, I began to miss it. Yes, the people talk pretentiously. Yes, the lyrics are bad. Yes, the plot is odd and even slow, even digressing a bit. But it's a wonderful experience, at least for me, this book. An odd early gem. :)"], ["I'm going to be dropping some Infinite Jest spoilers throughout this review. So don't read this review if you haven't read Infinite Jest. Seriously, don't read this review. Or read it until I say I'm going to drop a major DFW spoiler (not really I ended up not being nearly as spoiler-ific as I thought I would be, but there is till a major thing said that I believe knowing would make a first reading of Infinite Jest less interesting).I have a new theory about Infinite Jest and maybe others have had this theory too, or maybe I'm just full of shit, but I think a key to understanding parts of Infinite Jest might be the early works of Don Delillo. I haven't read all of the early Delillo novels yet so this is only a working theory, but my general thesis is that in at least some of the novels from White Noise and earlier there are themes that DFW is specifically dealing with. Delillo's second novel End Zone I would suggest is some of the inspiration for the Tennis Academy in DFW and may even suggest eschaton as a response to scene where one of the characters talks about football and war by saying football isn't a metaphor for war, war is war it needs no metaphors. Maybe one day I'll write my review for End Zone and go into the book a little more. Delillo's third novel, Great Jones Street is about a rock star who runs away from the tour he's on with his band, packs it all up and moves back to a small studio apartment in the East Village. A bunch of themes are going on in the book, stuff about the nature of celebrity and revolt and music and things like that, but also in the book is a mysterious drug that is mostly referred to as The Package. The Package is stolen from a government lab by some dirty hippies who give it to the main character to hold on to. The hippies are part of a commune called Happy Valley who believe that privacy is the most important freedom worth fighting for, and that privacy is being stripped away from the American (or Amerikan as they might write it) people. They have invaded on the privacy of the counter-culture rockstar hero who is in the process of trying to escape from the shine of the public (that is simplified but go with it) and it's the existence of The Package that drives much of the action in the book. No one knows what The Package will do if you take it but everyone knows that it's got to be heavy shit and everyone wants it. It's from the government so everyone figures that there has to be some kind of serious war / terrorist use that the drug could be used for, but that it must also be some kind of super-amazing new drug that will radically alter something. No one knows what, just that they want it. The competing groups who want The Package will go to any lengths to get it in their possession, but unfortunately for them the goods are no longer in the hands of the rockstar. Unfortunately for the people looking for the elusive Package and for the main character who can't even just hand over the goods and have everyone leave him alone. That is all a really idiotic book report version of the part of the book. Now here comes the DFW spoiler. Turn your head, or don't, but if you think you'll ever read Infinite Jest turn away now!The Package is similar to The Entertainment in Infinite Jest. It is just as elusive, just as sought after and just as cloaked in mythology and speculation. Also the characters who everyone thinks would have access to the grail of sorts in both books are just as clueless to it's whereabouts and ultimately become victims to the item in question. In Great Jones Street The Package is a drug. At the end of the book (this isn't a spoiler, or it should be but it's on the back of the fucking book, seriously) the drug is discovered to mess with the language part of the brain. Someone taking the drug has language literally removed from them, they no longer have access to being able to speak they are still aware of the world but they lack the ability to experience the world in language, or at least to express anything. The rockstar is given the drug and falls into this state, but ultimately to his own despair language returns and he eventually goes back to normal after a few weeks. One of the big mysteries in Infinite Jest is what happened to Hal. There are quite a few valid theories about what could have happened to Hal. DFW leaves clues all over the book pointing to a few different solutions to the question, and I don't think there is a definite answer, but the Hal of the books first chapter is in the same state as Bucky (the rockstar) is while he's being affected by The Package. With someone as meticulous and aware as DFW, and knowing that he had read Delillo I can't help but wonder at the similarities, even to the way that the two items, The Package and The Entertainment are referred to in their respective books. I would like to say that Hal ingested The Package, and that if that were the case he'd eventually regain his use of language and end up being ok (this is a whole other topic, was Hal ever ok? and then there is the Wittgenstein aspect of language and what would it mean in a Wittgenstein sense to lose the total use of language, what would that make us and the world around us? What does that mean for a concept of the self? And can we even be thought of as a self without the use of language? What would we be then? And since there is the difficulty of interiority and exteriority throughout Infinite Jest does the loss of the use of language not only trap one's self (and do we have a self without the other's gaze, and the language implicit in that gaze?) but also liberates the self in a crypto-Buddhist sort of way? But more importantly Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein, Wittgenstein because this points back to Broom and it's language that is at stake with The Package (but of course I'm drawing conclusions where there isn't even explicit relations)). Equating the two through their respective uses in the two books could it be said that Hal is a victim of the The Entertainment? Maybe The Entertainment isn't so entertaining as much as numbing that it shuts down the language part of the brain. The part of the brain that would say I'm hungry and drive a human to go eat, or that would say, stand up, and you'd stand up and leave. What is the ultimate in entertainment if it is not stupefying? This is all just conjecture, but I'm going to continue on reading through the early Delillo to see if I can find more ways to talk out of my ass."], ["\"Fame Puts You There Where Things Are Hollow\" (1)This is often regarded as one of DeLillo's lesser novels. However, I can't agree. It continues and anticipates the subject matter for which he has become famous as well as his clipped and precise writing style.If you're uncertain whether this book might be for you, I urge you to read at least the first chapter (three pages), if not also the last two chapters. The first chapter in particular contains some of the best and most exhilarating writing in DeLillo's career:\"Fame requires every kind of excess. I mean true fame, a devouring neon, not the somber renown of waning statesmen or chinless kings. I mean long journeys across gray space. I mean danger, the edge of every void, the circumstance of one man imparting an erotic terror to the dreams of the republic.\"Don't you love phrases like \"somber renown\" and \"erotic terror\", not to mention \"rueful nostalgia\" and \"convergent destinies\"? DeLillo is great at personalising and emotionalising abstraction. Here, he does it within a framework that could well be a Tarantino film. John Travolta could play rock star Bucky Wunderlick, and Uma Thurman his girlfriend Opel Hampson.There's much speculation that Bucky is derived from Bob Dylan, who dropped out of the mainstream after a motorcycle accident in 1966 and then recorded \"The Basement Tapes\" (which weren't released officially until 1975).At times, Bucky reminded me of John Lennon after the breakup of the Beatles (except Bucky's American) and Lou Reed after the breakup of the Velvet Underground. I think of the Velvets, because Bucky's unnamed band's third album is described as noise (as was \"White Light/White Heat\"). (2)Ultimately, however, DeLillo's portrait of Bucky is so complete we don't need to worry about his inspiration. Bucky is an archetypal rock musician circa 1973.To the extent this is a rock 'n' roll novel, and a good one at that, it's broader significance lies in the fact that the music industry at the time was a microcosm of capitalist society at large.Bucky walks away from his audience, a crowd, the public, his legend, his fame, his celebrity at its peak. Just as David Bowie turned his back on Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars and their legion of fans in 1973.Like his fans, Bucky has lost his sense of identity in the crowd. He and they have become manifestations of \"mass man\", none of them any longer an individual with authenticity and integrity. Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll SuicideOn stage, Bucky had already started to rebel against his status. His music had become mere noise and was played at such volume that it alone could almost kill or injure members of the audience. Still they worship him all the more. Their secret wish is that he too will die, preferably onstage and by his own hand, in their presence, a rock 'n' roll suicide.Remember that this novel was published in 1973, just a few years after the premature deaths (3) of Jimi Hendrix (1970) and Jim Morrison (1971).The audience expects the performer to take them to a place of greater danger, to the edge of the void, where death is possible, if not probable. Music, experienced in a crowd, confronts us with the experience of our own death or the experience of mass apocalyptic death.By walking away and breaking the pact with his audience, Bucky seeks out silence, an absence of or escape from language (which is itself the vehicle for social manipulation and control). He escapes, in order to become an individual, a private man, again. His departure is a quest for revolutionary solitude. Know Your ProductThe middle chapters concern two packages and the products within them.One product is \"The Mountain Tapes\" (Bucky\u2019s primitive recordings of 23 unaccompanied, almost imbecile songs recorded soon after his escape).His manager is desperate to release the tapes and get Bucky out on the road again. The tapes are yet more product that will satiate the musical appetite of his audience and the financial appetite of his corporate backers.The other product is some massively strong drugs that have been stolen from a secret U.S. Government installation, where they have been developed to \"brainwash gooks and radicals\". They affect the language sector of the brain.A number of groups are trying to get their hands on the drugs, so that they can distribute them within the so-called counterculture.At various times, Bucky has the packages with him in Opel\u2019s apartment in Great Jones Street. He receives many visitors looking for one or other package. In the end, they both get stolen, the tapes by his manager, the drugs by a faction of the Happy Valley Farm Commune.\"A Return to Prior Modes\"Bucky\u2019s manager convinces him to go back on the road. However, in the last chapter, in a scene reminiscent of \"Infinite Jest\", the Happy Valley Farm Commune prepares to kill Bucky or force him to commit suicide, (view spoiler)[although he actually takes a sample of the drugs and survives, speechless, wordless and wandering the streets of Manhattan, thus missing the chance to tour the Mountain Tapes:\"This was my double defeat, first a chance not taken to reappear in the midst of people and forces made to my design and then a second enterprise denied, alternate to the first, permanent withdrawal to that unimprinted level where all sound is silken and nothing erodes in the mad weather of language. Several weeks of immense serenity. Then ended...It's just a question of what sound to make or fake.\" Although Bucky is still alive, he is survived yet again by rumours that circulate amongst his followers.

For me Great Jones Street was a time of prayerful fatigue. I became a half-saint, practiced in visions, informed by a sense of bodily economy, but deficient in true pain.\"- Don DeLillo, Great Jones StreetA good DeLillo, just not a great one. I read this on a flight from SF to Phoenix. While there were parts of it that I loved (again and again DeLillo can throw out a sentence that seems almost electric; a prose version of a perpetual motion machine), he also tried several experiments with this novel that seemed wasted, or perhaps foul balls. Let me list a few:1. Lyrics - Please GOD don't inspire any future prose writers to suddenly want to fill their novels with lyrics. I understand that this is tempting, especially when writing about a rock legend. However, writing the lyrics of a famous, god-like, rock star is HARDER than writing a good sex scene. That wire is a tricky one to walk.2. Sex - DeLillo isn't bad at writing sex scenes, but he's not particularly great.3. The Ending - a real whimper. I'm not sure the book ever was skipping at 4stars or 5, but the ending definitely didn't raise it up in my estimation. If I were to drop this book next to its peers by DeLillo, it would fit closer to Point Omega, Cosmopolis, and The Body Artist.

See, the guy writes weird shit, but a lot of writers write weird shit that don't give me the same prickly feeling the best DeLillo does. No, what makes DeLillo such an odd writer is the combination of the weird shit he writes about and his chilly, almost journalistic tone, and this novel combines the both of them to the fullest effect out of what I've read so far. This particular volume ties reclusive rock stars, drugs, linguistic theory, and domestic terrorists as though it was casually commenting on the weather, complete with the usual exchanges featuring humor so deadpan it's sometimes hard to tell when you're meant to laugh.And it's a little rough around the edges. The rock lyrics presented don't quite come off as rock lyrics, although they're interesting as both social commentary and examinations of language. They have a Jim Morrison feel, which will probably send half the people who read this but haven't read Great Jones Street running to them and the other half running from it. There are also moments where DeLillo gets so lost in expressing his ideas and drawing connections that he forgets to tell a story or develop his characters, leaving you with conversations between people about passing underwear all around the country. So (and I bet End Zone is the same way), it's in some ways a retreat from Americana, and in other ways an advance. The characters still need work from a developmental perspective, but he's worked out how to make them fascinatingly strange without tumbling into Ratner's Star's excesses. You get masters of disguise, writers of porn for children, unscrupulous businessmen, and of course, domestic terrorists and our reclusive rock star. It's no masterpiece, but it sure is a fun ride."], ["A quietly unnerving downward spiral. In his ongoing survey of modern America, DeLillo's third book saw him looking at art and commerce through the lens of rock music and celebrity. One gets the sense that the narrator, rock star Bucky Wonderlick, having fled the stage mid-tour and retracted into a cold, empty apartment in a Lower East Side that was still both of those things (compared to its scrubbed, crowded modern counterpart), is somewhat paralyzed by his need to fully consider and understand what his actions mean, after years of skirting such introspection in favor of the constant sprint onwards. But his inactivity itself becomes a sort of action and ideology (and an unconsidered one, at that), as well as perhaps another marketing angle in his music career. All of these things twist the book up into a plotline and send it on its way. Despite the fairly direct and active plotting this time around, as with most DeLillo there's a lot of depth and beauty to incidentals, from the sounds of the downstairs neighbor dreaming to a hallucinatory burning fire station. Unfortunately, the bracing austerity of Wonderlick's thoughts and activities (as well as of DeLillo's prose, scalpel sharp even without the complete rhythm and poetry of his more recent work) are undercut by the steady stream of visitors required to advance the story, a drugs-and-cults-and-paranoia arc which seems far less interesting than the tone and central setting."]], "review_count": "122", "description": "A troubling satire of the romantic myth of stardom and the empty heart of rock and roll, more relevant than ever in our celebrity-obsessed times.<br /><br />Bucky Wunderlick is a rock and roll star.

I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family.

Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again. 'In three variants on the classic detective story, Paul Auster makes the well-traversed terrain of New York city his own, as it becomes a strange, compelling landscape in which identities merge or fade and questions serve only to further obscure the truth.'I stayed on in the house for a few more days. My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place. Fanshawe was there, and no matter how hard I tried not to think of him, I couldn't escape. This was unexpected, galling. Now that I had stopped looking for him, he was more present to me than ever before. The whole process had been reversed. After all these months of trying to find him, I felt as though I was the one who had been found..."]], "review_count": "61", "description": "\u00abTodo empez\u00f3 por un n\u00famero equivocado, el tel\u00e9fono son\u00f3 tres veces en mitad de la noche y la voz al otro lado pregunt\u00f3 por alguien que no era \u00e9l.\u00bb As\u00ed comienza <i>La ciudad de cristal</i>, primera de las tres novelas que conforman <i>La trilog\u00eda de Nueva York</i>.

Here are the opening few line: \"First of all there is Blue. Later there is White, and then there is Black, and before the beginning there is Brown. Brown broke him in, Brown taught him the ropes, and when Brown grew old, Blue took over.\" Blue is a detective and it is Blue we follow on every page of this sparse (less than 100 pages) novel set in 1947 New York City. Actually, this is the 2nd of the author's The New York Trilogy, bookended by City of Glass and The Locked Room.To gain an initial feel for the novel, please go to Youtube and watch a snippet of one of those 1940s black-and-white noir films, like The Naked City. You will see lots of hard-talking tough guys in gray suits and gray hats running around city streets socking one another in the jaw and plugging one another with bullets -- plenty of action to be sure. And that's exactly the point - a world chock-full of police, detectives, crooks and dames is a world of action. But what happens when one of those 1940s detectives is put on a case where all action is stripped away, when the only thing the detective has to do is look out his apartment window and keep an eye on a man across the street in another apartment sitting at his desk reading or writing? This is exactly what happens in Ghosts. So, rather than providing a more detailed synopsis of the story (actually, there is some action and interaction), I will cite several of Blue's musing along with my brief comments on Blue's relationship to literary and artistic creation:\"Until now, Blue has not had much chance for sitting still, and this new idleness has left him at something of a loss. For the first time in his life, he finds that he has been thrown back on himself, with nothing to grab hold of, nothing to distinguish one moment from the next. He has never given much through to the world inside him, and through he always knew it was there, it has remained an unknown quantity, unexplored and therefore dark, even to himself.\" --------- So, for the first time in his life, Blue is given a taste of silence and solitude, the prime experience of someone who is a writer.\"More than just helping to pass the time, he discovers that making up stories can be a pleasure in itself.\" ---------- Removed from the world of action and building on his experience of silence and solitude, Blue is also given a hint of what it might mean to be a fiction writer, one who sits in isolation, exploring the inner world of imagination in order to create stories. And, on the topic of stories, the unnamed narrator conveys how Blue reflects on many stories, including the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, stories from the lives of Walk Whitman and Henry David Thoreau, and several stories Blue reads in his all-time favorite magazine: True Detective. Auster's short novel is teaming with stories.\"For the first time in his experience of writing reports, he discovers that words do not necessarily work, that it is possible for them to obscure the things they are trying to say.\" ---------- Blue discerns it is possible that words cannot adequately articulate the depth and full range of human experience. And what is true of a detective's report is truer for works of great literature: there is a rich, vital, vibrant world of feeling and imagination beyond the confines of words and language.\"Finally mustering the courage to act, Blue reaches into his bag of disguises and casts about for a new identity. After dismissing several possibilities, he settles on an old man who used to beg on the corner of his neighborhood when he was a bog - a local character by the name of Jimmy Rose - and decks himself out in the garb of tramphood . . .\" ---------- During the course of the novel, Blue take on a number of different identities and with each new persona he experiences life with a kind of immediacy and intensity. Spending a measure of his creative life as a screenwriter and director, Paul Auster undoubtedly had many encounters with actors thriving on their roles, energized and invigorated as they performed for the camera. I suspect Auster enjoyed placing his detective main character in the role of actor at various points.Ghosts can be read as a prompt to question how identity is molded by literature and the arts.

In this second, his fractal inquiry turns towards the question of authorship and, by necessity, readership.The plot runs on one level (like the first book) as a detective story, summarized neatly from the back cover thus: \"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black. From a rented room on Orange Street, Blue keeps watch out his window, making notes about his subject, who sits across the street in another rented room, staring out of _his_ window.\"Auster spins a plot marked typically (for him) by doublings, parallels, erasures, Mobius twists and a dramatic conclusion. The ultimate whodunit, meanwhile, resides with existential questions raised by Pascal (a favorite source of Auster's), and Thoreau. The former figures in a previous book of essays, called INVENTION OF SOLITUDE, in which Auster quotes him numerous times: \"All the unhappiness of man stems from one thing only: that he is incapable of staying quietly in his room.\"Auster's inquiry gets more dramatic treatment in the fictional Trilogy; in GHOSTS, Thoreau's work makes a prominent appearance, as Blue discovers while snooping that Black is reading WALDEN. For most of rest of GHOSTS, Blue grapples with WALDEN, both the experience of reading it and the questions it raises.Why do we do the things we do, particularly suffer destructive encounters with other humans? Why don't we all move out to the pond and live as satisfied hermits? \"Because,\" says one of Auster's characters in a climactic scene (p.75): \"Because he needs me\u2026 he needs my eyes looking at him. He needs me to prove he's alive.\"But if this proof resolves one thing, it unearths multiple more unknowns. In less than 100 pages, Auster makes these phantoms visible, with thrilling and unsettling results.*WHY I READ THIS BOOK: I'm re-reading the New York Trilogy. See Volume 1 (CITY OF GLASS) for the whys and wherefores."], ["Auster follows up what I believe to be a near flawless masterpiece with a poignant tragi-something that plays out like one extended...something. There is no denying that the book really IS something.  With its own style of wit, mystery, and tragedy, Ghosts largely consists of the most intentionally boring and bland detective story ever. A guy named Blue has just been hired to spy on this other guy named Black. He sits in the apartment from the opposite side of Black's and observes him, often getting bored and exhausted and all that. Sometimes, Black actually (GASP) leaves his home and takes a walk, maybe visits a bookstore. Auster gets the reader so pumped when his characters actually step outside. And yet the book is never really boring. As a matter of fact, these extended stretches of time that depict minimalist tendencies bordering on their most extreme are kind of fun to read in a unique way only an author like Auster can really pull off. While more mature and perhaps less flawed overall, Ghosts unfortunately doesn't come close to matching the brilliance of its predecessor. However, that's really just me. Plenty of people who hated City of Glass would probably be able to at least tolerate this. After all, it isn't even one hundred pages! Another fun thing to note: The book is filled with literary and otherwise art-based references, whether they be to Walt Whitman or Robert Mitchum. Most notably, Thoreau's Walden plays a very similar role to that of Don Quixote in the previous novella in the trilogy. It helps reestablish many of the novella's central themes, concepts, plot points (although the plot of this book is clearly quite loose), and so on. Really, this book is just about some guy alone observing what (the Walden pond/Black) inhabits the outside of his apartment (cabin) and writing it all down, including all sorts of records of philosophical thoughts or encounters, any event that could possibly be noteworthy."], ["Could it be possible that Auster learned from his weaknesses? The first thing any reader of City of Glass would notice about this second installment is the sophomore effort is still shorter! Weighing in at only 96 pages, I wondered how many crises of existence Auster would try to cram into this one: love in the twentieth century; how far the hand of God reaches toward earth; life after death? But no, Auster sailed through this more complete and better work by picking up on his earlier theme of the relationship between an author and his subject and just staying on target. The result? A powerful vignette featuring basically anonymous figures (all the characters are named after colors) buoyed by Auster\u2019s clean, compact style and simple plots. The tension here is more detectable to the reader. If the reader is jumping at Auster\u2019s questions, he at least feels confident that he is guessing at answers to Auster\u2019s puzzles, rather than imagining what Auster was trying to do in the first place. This is a vast improvement over City of Glass. \tIn Ghosts, the protagonist, Blue, another detective, is assigned to simply keep his private eye focused on a man living in a sparse apartment across the street, Black, and record all of his daily moves, down to the minute details. But all Black does all day is write. Bored and soon lost in his new role, Blue surrounds himself with images of his identity: photos of his parents (pre-Blue), reminders of the stories he forever wants to write, a snapshot with his happily-retired mentor, the movie plot he feels his own story should follow, a shot of his hero Jackie Robinson sliding into third, a portrait of Walt Whitman. Nothing of his current life, only where he has been and where he wants to go.  Becoming stir crazy in this absence of a fulfilling present, and although content with his paycheck, Blue decides to engage Black in a serious of plotted encounters, attempting to learn more about this shadowy character, and inevitably about himself in the process. Eventually, the walls between Black and Blue crumble, and Auster tips his hand as to the novel\u2019s internal struggle: the tension between author and character. Which of the two writes and which acts, which records while the other creates? We are left with a better sense of how an author struggles with his own characters in trying to avoid becoming the subject of everything he writes. It\u2019s an endless circle, and one the author must inevitably travel alone. Black\u2019s hobby turns out to be studying American writers in an \u201ceffort to understand things.\u201d (That\u2019s about as much specificity as we can expect out of Auster.) Black and Blue discuss Hawthorne\u2019s shutting himself in his room for twelve years to write The Vicar of Wakefield, an act which prompts Black to comment \u201cWriting is a solitary business. It takes over your life. In some sense, a writer has no life of his own. Even when he\u2019s there, he\u2019s not really there.\u201d To which Blue responds, \u201cAnother ghost.\u201d Voila, a title.  One thing is certain: Blue is an author through and through. He tosses Thoreau\u2019s Walden aside as worthless. Who would go live in a forest where there\u2019s nothing to write about, we hear Blue think, as we pity his inability to define himself through anything but his characters. As Black and Blue idly sit and script each other\u2019s lives, the reader can\u2019t help but feel a sense of loneliness descend upon this closed, difficult, two-person world. Are they simply alter egos, or are they author and character (and which one plays which)? By the end, we wonder whether Auster summed up the difficulties of writing best by the way he named his characters: what\u2019s harder for any author to describe than \u201cblue\u201d? But what profession doesn\u2019t have its troubles. Of course, we can only expect Auster to write with such potency about his own demons (although we get the sense he\u2019d rather do otherwise). We see clearly now the link to City of Glass, the elementary lesson that authors, despite their troubles and torments with identities and characters, simply must live through and by writing. And they are only human. Black\u2019s hobby seems suddenly futile. \u201cWe always talk about trying to get inside a writer to understand his work better,\u201d Black confesses to Blue on a Brooklyn stoop beneath a summer sunset. \u201cBut when you get right down to it, there\u2019s not much to find in there\u2014 at least not much that\u2019s different from what you\u2019d find in anyone else.\u201d Auster better stop inviting us into such intriguing stories, or else we will never be able to stop prying, as any good detective should."], ["Auster is playing with you from the start. When you are given characters name Black, White and Blue, you know you are in a realm of unreality. Since I just finished the first book in the New York Trilogy (City of Glass) I knew Auster was really infatuated with the author/reader/book \"space\" where what was of interest to him was not the plot/characters/\"point\" of the novel, but in how the reader responds to what he reads of the author's words, in how the reader re-formulates the story/characters in his head. This re-formulation is where Auster has staked his claim. He no longer wants it be the elephant in the room, he is dragging it out in front of it by the trunk!The wonder of the book is that his sentence to sentence writing is somehow magically interesting. The danger is that this type of conceited (i.e. it has a trick or \"conceit\") writing can leave the reader with a big case of the \"who cares?\". But I think he pulls it off with his writing.As far as the book - well, my running hypothesis was that the book was a metaphor for the act of reading and writing a novel, with one character being the writer, one the reader, and one the publisher - the one who actually sends it out into the world. More than \"City of Glass\", this one got me thinking of the act of creation as I was reading it. And once again, I start out giving the book three stars, and then once I write the review, I find out I've really written a four star review...I guess I really liked it."], ["Reading Ghosts, I had the bizarre feeling, the whole time, that I'd read the story before. That I'd read about this premise being played out somewhere else. In any case, I think I've got more of a handle on the kind of story Paul Auster is telling. It's definitely not a clear-cut detective novel -- I didn't expect it to be, but some people tried to read it and the first book, at least, in that way.It's oddly absorbing despite the quiet feel of it; I read it more or less in one sitting. It's very odd. Quiet, like I said, with lots of space to think."], ["An uncanny valley of Gaddis IMHO. 'Ghosts', the second book in Auster's 'New York Trilogy' reminds me what I both like and don't like about MFA writers. Often clever and grammatically precise but they don't say so much.

"The second book in the acclaimed New York Trilogy--a detective story that becomes a haunting and eerie exploration of identity and deception. It is a story of hidden violence that culminates in an inevitable but unexpectedly shattering climax.", "author": "Paul Auster"}, "New York Dreams (Virex Trilogy, #3)": {"average_rating": "3.85", "review": [["First, a brief harangue. I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction.

This collection of essays and prefaces on mainly avant-garde-ish writers (I'll ignore the interviews, which are mostly biographical and craft-related) is more informational than astute, and finds his writing sharpened, but dull: the architecture of the sentences and paragraphs is more adroit (with the exception of the titular essay, which reads like a slightly precocious undergrad paper-- it may well be), but the rhetoric is austere and unengaging. Despite having started his career as a poet, Auster displays limited flair for metaphor, simile, and lyricism (these may seem glamour qualms, but sometimes it's the eyeshadow in a writer's voice that catches your eye).

Like anyone else who knows a thing or two about political participation and social capital, this book rings hollow and insincere at certain points.Briefly, Putnam rests far too much of his argument on the decline of traditional, conventional \"community organizations\" of a previous era (like The Lion's Club, the Elks or the Masons). He pays scant attention to how divisive, racist, sexist, and homophobic many of these organizations were and how they all demanded a degree of conformity. Furthermore, he manages to write off the importance of both social movements and support-based groups in a single, short chapter without acknowledging the way that social movements allow new flexible forms of participation or how support-based groups may allow a greater degree of \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" social capital. If you take an AA meeting or a meeting for single parents, of course the people in these groups have a single thing in common but they are just as likely to have many things not in common, such as the neighbourhood they live in, the type of job they have, and racial background.Further to this, his means of measurement are simply not adequate. Using the GSS to track club involvement is disingenuous, for example, because they ask \"Were you a member of this type of club?\" The answer is yes or no, and does not allow individuals to count the multiple kinds of clubs they belong to of a single kind (such as belonging to two environmental clubs).There is certainly something going in American - CONVENTIONAL forms of political participation and civic participation are declining, but there are many emerging forms of participation which Putnam writes off or ignores altogether. He acknowledges that we need to find new ways to participate that that fit our current era as the old kinds of community organization may not work, but at the same time he ignores, writes off, or undervalues the ways in which people are already participating in new and innovative ways - such as support groups, continuing social movements, community festivals, pick-up sports leagues, short-lived issue based groups, more flexible forms of political participation, and the multiple kinds of participation that are made possible by the internet and related forms of technology.Still, there is a great deal of valuable information in this book and a number of keen insights but Putnam's needs to open his mind up to new, innovative, and unconventional forms of participation and networks in order to make a more convincing argument."], ["God this book is painstaking.

Then, this steady increase in partipation became a sharp drop, and civic life continues to decline. Various things could have caused the decline: women entering the work force, racial integration, the internet, longer commutes, busier work schedules. Really, though, the evidence points to two main things that caused this decline: television and generational differences (the baby boomers were less likely to volunteer, Gen X even moreso, and so on). This is a shame, because people who are involved in civic life (even something as small as playing cards or hosting dinner parties) are more likely to vote, to volunteer, to have friends, to create safe neighborhoods, to make more money, etc, etc. This book might just finally get my ass in gear to do the volunteering I've been talking about."], ["Robert Putnam's books was several books in one. The first section (about the first 4 chapters) drew me in with a synopsis of the decline of community in America. The second section, through chapter 15, nearly put me to sleep. :) Thankfully, however, I kept reading because from chapter 16 until the end of the book was so good, that I give it 5 stars despite the slogging in the middle. Putnam's five keys for social capital was worth the entire book. Here is my takeaways:Putnam list five specific areas where the trust and understanding inured by social capital helps translate aspirations into realities:1. Social capital allows citizens to resolve collective problems more easily through improved teamwork.2. Social capital greases the wheels that allow communities to advance smoothly through improved trust.3. Social capital helps widen the awareness of fellow citizens that their fates are intertwined through improved understanding.4. Social capital serves as conduits for the flow of helpful information and resources to accomplish community and individual goals.5. Social capital improves individual lives through psychological and biological processes. In fact, numerous studies suggest lives that are rich in social capital cope with trauma and illnesses significantly more effectively.Despite social capital\u2019s overwhelming advantages, Putnam acknowledges its decline, writing, \u201cAmericans have had a growing sense at some visceral level of disintegrating social bonds.\u201d Furthermore, he writes, \u201cMore than 80% of Americans said there should be more emphasis on community, even if it puts more demands on individuals.\u201d In sum, social capital isn\u2019t just the fuel for Social Power \u2013 a necessary check on State Power \u2013 but it also enhances individual lives through the sense of belonging engendered within communities. Strikingly, then, the decline of social capital, not only attacks society\u2019s freedoms, but also attacks an individual\u2019s well-being. Simply put, America cannot remain free without a revival of Social Power through building social capital in voluntary communities. With so much at stake, why aren\u2019t more people focused on restoring voluntary communities throughout America and the West?"], ["The classic that triggered the movement to study and document the collapse of \"social capital\" - obligatory and reciprocal social relationships that build through more regular human interaction with neighbors as well as in groups like bowling leagues (hence the metaphor in the title) and civic groups. By the end of the last decade, arguments for strategies and interventions that would augment \"social capital\" in both individual and communities were vogue in grant applications, showing how quickly Putnam's ideas became institutionalized.I've used an excerpt of this in my Intro. SOC class for a decade now and it's helpful for students to understand the context for the increasing alienation and dysfunction they feel in their own lives, especially when supplemented with the data that over a quarter of U.S. adults can name not a single friend and social isolation is a huge problem (and increasingly pointed to as a cause, not a consequence, of substance abuse and mental health problems.) There is also data from \"gated communities\", the phenomena separating the \"haves\" from the \"have nots\" around the world, that while residents naturally list security as a top attraction, \"knowing your neighbors\" was another top-listed reason, then many apparently drew a blank when later in the survey were asked to list neighbors they knew by first name. Only a small number listed even one. (This was a sociology study of gated community residents in Houston, TX, that was one of the original cities that started gated/locked communities. Of course, those Houstonites knew that their neighbors weren't brown or black skin, generally, so we know what is important about our neighbors in gated communities - they are wealthy and white!)Putnam is a good Liberal and no radical, but I can't help think that he didn't simply document what Marx predicted long ago, that capitalism would lead to alienation of self from others as well as from ourselves."], ["I'm not sure I could give full justice to this book in a hastily written review, so I'm not going to try. Robert Putnam's seminal treatise on social capital is jam-packed with statistics and information to back up his claims that social capital has been on a serious decline since the 1960s, much to the detriment of American society. He delineates a difference between two types of social capital--bonding (strong ties to a small inner circle of people, like family) and bridging (weak ties to a diverse and sprawling array of people)--and the struggle to balance between the two, even while both are declining. He explains the history of social capital and the decline, the possible reasons contributing to the decline, reasons why the decline of social capital is bad for society and suggestions for things that can be done to slow the decline. Everything he says is extensively researched and cited. Every time I thought I had come up with a counterargument or a detail he had missed, he addressed it a few pages or chapters later. The only problem with the book is that it was written in 2000. A surprising number of things have changed in the last eight years, including but not limited to: 9/11, Katrina, George Bush, Facebook/Myspace, broader expansion of use of the internet, 2008 Democratic Primaries, Iraq War, rise of the \"green\" movement, cheaper air travel, etc. In the last section of the book, he challenges society to make a series of changes by 2010, changes that sound somewhat impossible to achieve in so short a time. But, after just these eight years, it seems that much of what he prescribed is on its way to coming true, and I am very curious as to what he would have to say about it. Unfortunately, I think his research has moved on to other topics (diversity...). In any case, this is a very important book about the way members of our society interact (or don't interact) with each other and what that means."], ["Social capital is the grease that keeps society moving, but over the past 30 years it has decreased. Bowling Alone is the influential book that gathered the data behind this trend and put social capital on the radar of the nation.Social networks give rise to generalized reciprocity and trust. This is social capital. Reciprocity and trust are most useful when applied generally and not just those who have helped you in the past. Social capital allows society operate smoothly. People rely on social connections for friendships, romantic relationships, job referrals, and community and political organization. Social capital is correlated with individual happiness and with community goods such as lower crime rates.For all the good that it causes, social capital is, like most tools, not unambiguously good. Gangs and the KKK are held together by social capital just as the PTA and Habitat volunteers are. Being gay in a close knit conservative Christian community can ruin lives. The rarely realized ideal is a society with large amounts of social capital and a large tolerance for difference, but the tensions between these tendencies are hard to reconcile.Bowling Alone analyzes empirical data to show that social capital had been declining for 30 years (the book is copyright 2000, data from earlier). Putnam considers political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace connections, altruism, volunteering, and philanthropy, and perceptions of reciprocity, honesty, and trust. All measures have shown declines, from mild to dramatic. Some new trends seem to defy the decline (e.g., internet communities), but Putnam makes a compelling case that social capital is generally declining.Consider volunteering as an example. In the US, we volunteer about twice as much as in other developed nations. Volunteering may be formal (through an organization such as United Way) or informal (house sitting for a neighbor). Over half of Americans volunteer when informal volunteering is counted. Volunteering is correlated with higher levels of philanthropic giving.Education predicts volunteer activity; college graduates are twice as likely to volunteer. Parents volunteer the most because of their involvement with activities related to their children (e.g., school, sports teams). Community size, wealth, and family status are other predictors of volunteer activity. Americans who entertain at home are also more likely to volunteer than those who do not.Community involvement is the most important predictor of volunteer activity. Data from 1996 shows that 73% of members of secular organizations and 55% of members of religious organizations volunteer. Only 19% of individuals not involved in organizations volunteer. Members of religious organizations tend to volunteer mostly for their church. Organizations provide volunteer opportunities for their members and act as recruitment pools.Over the past 30 years, volunteer activity has not dropped across the board. Formal volunteering has decreased, but informal volunteering is more common. More people outside of organizations are volunteering, but they do not form long term relationships. There is a troubling generational decline with respect to volunteer activity. The \"long civic generation\", the generation before the Boomers, has volunteered more at every stage of life than the Boomers and Generation X is worse (although there have been indications that the Millenials may be reversing this slightly).What is behind the declines in volunteering and other types of participation? Given the difficulty of analyzing social trends, Putnam's explanations are guesses. Up to 10% of the decline in these measures can be attributed to time and money pressures on families, up to another 10% can be explained by suburban sprawl and long commutes, and another 25% can be explained by electronic media, especially television. By far, the largest contributor generational succession. The Boomers and Generation X replace the long civic generation in numbers, but their percentage participation is comparatively abysmal. This may explain up to half of the decline in participation. Why this is occurring is an open question.Overall, Bowling Alone was a fascinating and informative book. The quantitative information makes it a valid and credible resource. The publication of Bowling Alone prompted debate over the conclusions Putnam drew, but makes it clear that there are trends to consider, and whether they are considered good, bad, or neutral, they are worth examining."], ["read for my social democracy seminar. it seems really logical now, but when the book was written in 1995, and it was really, really revolutionary. his main thesis is that americans are not volunteering in the same ways in before - we are not joining community organizations anymore. young people are still volunteering, but mostly individually. (his title comes from the fact that people don't join bowling leagues anymore.) i would recommend reading the first half, skimming the statistics, and reading the conclusion. it's genius for what it is, and i wish more people would read it. it was so ground-breaking."], ["This is one of those books that I suspect of being cited (and argued against) far more often than it's read. In my head, I had it classed vaguely as pop social science. Turns out, I was very wrong. Bowling Alone may be the most academic book I've read since leaving college, and at times I felt like I was being beaten to the ground by statistical clubs coming at me from every direction. But despite the leaden density and occasional painful-in-retrospect predictions about our technological future, this is an important book, one that's challenged many of my assumptions and given me a new framework in which to consider everyday events.And no, I don't just like it because it, like me, is critical of cars, critical of televisions, and willing to blame the Baby Boomers for planting the seeds of so many of our current social ills. But I admit those things don't hurt."], ["Putnam's research on this phenomenon is valuable, but because of his egalitarian convictions he obscures a core cause of it (multiculturalism and non-White immigration) and refuses to draw the obvious conclusion or make the necessary policy recommendations."], ["I found this book fascinating, and couldn't stop talking about it while I was reading it and for several months afterward. While I found the approach to \"social capital\" somewhat akin to commoditizing friendships and civic interaction, I found so much richness in Putnam's thoughtful analysis of multiple diverse data sources, with plenty of charts and graphs to enjoy!Putnam's premise is that our stores of social capital in the U.S. have been making a drastic plummeting curve (in visual terms) since the 60s. As I understand it, by social capital he is referring to the social connections that make a cohesive community, or on a larger scale, a nation. These can include informal measures such as playing cards, bowling leagues or having friends over for dinner, or formal measures such as PTA enrollment, church attendance, and voting. He presents chapters and chapters of evidence to support his observation, and attempts to explore a few possible explanations for this phenomenon. I appreciate that he doesn't pretend to have the answer, and doesn't present one possibility as the culprit. I also appreciate that he takes a look at the \"dark side\" of social capital--homogeneity and exclusivity. This book was published in 200, so I would love to read an updated look at this topic.Here are a few examples from the book:\"During the fist two-thirds of the century Americans took a more and more active role in the social and political life of their communities--in churches and union halls, in bowling alleys and clubrooms, around committee tables and card tables and dinner tables. Year by year we gave more generously to charity, we pitched in more often on community projects, and (insofar as we can still find reliable evidence) we behaved in an increasingly trustworthy way toward one another. Then, mysteriously and more or less simultaneously, we began to do all those things less often.We are still more civically engaged than citizens in many other countries, but compared with our own recent past, we are less connected. We remain interested and critical spectators of the public scene. We kibitz, but we don't play, We maintain a facade of formal affiliation, but we rarely show up. We have invented new ways of expressing our demands that demand less of us. We are less likely to turn out for collective deliberation--whether in the voting booth or the meeting hall--and when we do, we find that discouragingly few of our friends and neighbors have shown up. We are less generous with our money and (with the important exception of senior citizens) with our time, and we are less likely to give strangers the benefit of the doubt. They, of course, return the favor.\"(183)\"Compared with the citizens of most other countries, Americans have always lived a nomadic existence. Nearly one in five of us move each year and, having done so, are likely to pick up and move again. More than two in five of us expect to move in the next five years. As a result, compared with other peoples, Americans have become accustomed to pitching camp quickly and making friends easily. From our frontier and immigrant past we have learned to plunge into new community institutions when we move.Nevertheless, for people as for plants, frequent repotting disrupts root systems.\"(204)\"The car and the commute...are demonstrably bad for community life. In round numbers the evidence suggests that each additional ten minutes in daily commuting time cuts involvement in community affairs by 10 percent...Strikingly, increased commuting time among the residents of a community lowers average levels of civic involvement even among noncommuters...In other words, this appears to be a classic \"synergistic effect,\" in which the consequences of individual actions spill beyond the individuals in question. In the language of economists, commuting has negative externalities.\"(213)\"Electronic technology allows us to consume this hand-tailored entertainment in private, even utterly alone...As the poet T.S. Eliot observed early in the television age, \"It is a medium of entertainment which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, and yet remain lonesome.\" The artifice of canned laughter reflected both the enduring fact that mirth is enhanced by companionship and the novel fact that companionship could now be simulated electronically.\"(217)\"Child psychologists speak of a fairly primitive stage of social development called \"parallel play\"--two kids in a sandbox, each playing with a toy but not really interacting with each other. In healthy development children outgrow parallel play. But the public spectacles of television leave us at that arrested stage of development, rarely moving beyond parallel attentiveness to the same external stimulus.\"(244)\"With evidence from a single point in time, we cannot distinguish between life cycle and generational effects, but if we follow a given cohort over the years, we can more readily distinguish the two. And the two effects have dramatically different social consequences. Life cycle effects mean that individuals change, but society as a whole does not. Generational effects mean that society changes, even though individuals do not.So before we can tell whether the ubiquitous age-related differences in civic engagement are truly generational, and thus producing social change, we need to determine whether these differences are attributable to the normal life cycle. With comparable evidence across several decades, we can follow each cohort as its members move through various stages of life. If successive cohorts generally retrace the same ups and downs as they age, we can be reasonably sure that we are observing a life cycle pattern. If not, it is more likely that age-related differences are generational in origin.\"(248)\"Social scientists have long been concerned about \"dilemmas\" of collective action. Such dilemmas are ubiquitous, and their dynamics are straightforward. People often might all be better off if they cooperate, with each doing her share. But each individual benefits more by shirking her responsibility, hoping that others will do the work for her. Moreover, even if she is wrong and the others shirk, too, she is still better off than if she had been the only sucker. Obviously if every individual thinks that the others will do the work, nobody will end up taking part, and all will be left worse off than if all had contributed.\"(288)\"It turns out that in states where citizens view other people as basically honest, tax compliance is higher than in low-social-capital states...Similarly, surveys have found that individual taxpayers who believe that others are dishonest or are distrustful of government are more likely themselves to cheat. My willingness to pay my share depends crucially on my perception that others are doing the same. In effect, in a community rich in social capital, government is 'we,' not 'they.'\"(347)"]], "review_count": "427", "description": "Once we bowled in leagues, usually after work--but no longer.

Did she yearn for the warm waves of the Pacific curling on the sands of Hawaii? Such freedom young Didion had, such time to feel angst, to observe others, to write, clear-eyed and fiercely about her time and place in a world where people filled their voids with drug, sex, and rock-n-roll. I imagine my mother reading about a gathering of earnest young activists and intellectuals \"reluctant about gathering up their books and magazines and records, about finding their car keys and ending the day, and by the time they are ready to leave Joan Baez is eating potato salad with her fingers from a bowl in the refrigerator, and everyone stays to share it, just a little while longer where it is warm\" and wishing she were in their midst, instead of pushing a shopping cart down the aisles of Pak-n-Save, filling it with boxes of Kraft Mac-n-Cheese and Hamburger Helper. This collection of twenty essays, originally published in a variety of magazines, chronicles Didion's internal and external worlds at a singular time in modern American history. Her cool, unsentimental observations have come to exemplify California during the mid 60s and 70s, her unwavering voice carrying the mantle of feminism\u2014here is a writer, a woman, unafraid to admit how very angry and afraid she really is. Or unafraid to admit a lifelong crush on the manufactured, wooden John Wayne, a caricature of the American man.Perhaps it is this voice my mother held onto so tightly, searching in Didion's words for the key to self-expression, independence, and experimentation\u2014all the things my mother missed as she moved straight from childhood to motherhood. Perhaps she longed to belong to Didion's California where\". . . time past is not believed to have any bearing on time present or future, out in the golden land where every day the world is born anew.\" Oh, don't we all?"], ["\"The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\"- The Second Coming, Yeats\u201cI know something about dread myself, and appreciate the elaborate systems with which some people fill the void, appreciate all the opiates of the people, whether they are as accessible as alcohol and heroin and promiscuity or as hard to come by as faith in God or History.\u201d \u2015 Joan Didion, Slouching Towards BethlehemI'm sure at some point Joan Didion will disappoint. I'm positive the honeymoon period will run out. I'll discover a fatal flaw, a series of articles, or a minor novel that she just 'phoned in', but not yet bitches. Seriously, if prose could make me pregnant, I would now be Nadya Suleman.I know this is just the normal hormonal response I get whenever I really seem to mesh or synch with an author or artist. I felt this way when I first read DFW's and McPhee's nonfiction. This is the same brain-storm that happened when I first read Delillo & Bellow's fiction; the same awe I felt when I walked into the Paris Opera and saw that giant Chagall ceiling hanging beyond that infamous, 7-ton bronze and crystal chandelier. Those same chills ran down my spine and flushed my face the first time I swallowed a Vicodin. I felt just as complete the first time I watched a Coen brothers movie. I also felt this the first time I discovered my arm naturally guided my hand to my lap. No, this isn't a revolution. It isn't even revolutionary. It a euphoria and I know it. I get it. I'm already cooling down. But I'm just going to leave the book here on my chest for awhile until my heart slows down a bit."], ["BEI TEMPI ADDIONonostante in un capitolo (questo libro raccoglie articoli usciti su riviste) dal titolo Non riesco a togliermi quel mostro dalla testa, la signora Didion esprima opinioni tranchant su Kubrick, Antonioni, Visconti, Bergman, dimostrando per la prima e unica volta che perfino lei pu\u00f2 sbagliare, prendere cantonate e dire bestialit\u00e0, ho amato questo libro e amo profondamente questa meravigliosa scrittrice, sentimento costruito su una breve intensa conoscenza (incontrata per la prima volta neppure cinque mesi fa, \u00e8 la sua quarta opera che leggo e apprezzo a fondo).Joan Didion in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, nell\u2019aprile del 1967.Viene definita la migliore scrittrice vivente in lingua inglese (e io le auguro mille anni oltre gli 80 che compir\u00e0 il 5 dicembre prossimo) e si dice che proprio nel giornalismo proponga il meglio di s\u00e9.

Il fatto che Joan Didion sia sempre dentro la narrazione, che il suo io sia in prossimit\u00e0 dell\u2019oggetto del racconto. Non nel modo fastidioso che spinge a riportare tutto l\u2019universo a se stessi, a misurare abissi e cieli sul metro del proprio vissuto: ma con quella sua capacit\u00e0 di trasformare le proprie difficolt\u00e0 e debolezze in leve di forza, informando e illuminando senza intromettersi nel racconto.

To lack it is to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference.\"\nSomehow, I usually read Didion on a blue night, when it's so bright outside that I open my curtains to search for the moon; instead, what greets me is a pale hue of blue sky. When I read Blue Nights, I had a similar experience. These are the kind of nights that reminds a reader of what she is, of what she is not: \"We flatter ourselves by thinking this compulsion to please others an attractive trait: a gist for imaginative empathy, evidence of our willingness to give.\" Oh how I would love to teach Didion's \"On Self-Respect,\" if only to garner the provocative perspective of a generation not yet born when she experienced and wrote this collection. People debate the essay form often; some think it is simply nonfiction, some are not even sure about the distinction between nonfiction, narrative nonfiction, memoir, and the personal essay. The art of nonfiction is intrinsically disconcerting and perhaps intentional in its derived eclecticism. Still, it is beautiful. Thank goodness we have modern essayists like Leslie Jamison to remind us of the form, an essayist who in my opinion, resembles Didion in style and concept. Any debate of the essay as an art form, should be silenced by Didion's slouching. Why did I take so long to read this, I asked myself as I palmed my forehead, for I drooled through each page, not even noticing when it was time to clear my desk for office hours with students.These essays illuminate the America of the 1960s that will never exist again, and yet it is the America of today - the odd juxtaposition confuses, I know. Didion has managed to illustrate a landscape of hurt and pain, of music and money, of politics, drugs, rehabilitation, and gain. This is New York, this is California, this is a slouch towards Bethlehem. I was moved by her memoirs Blue Nights and The Year of Magical Thinking; however, with this book, I was inspired by not only the stories and the essay form, but also by the art of the craft of narrative nonfiction in some of her pieces, this art that places a writer within the center of observation, and yet silences her persona. \nThe impulse to write things down is a peculiarly compulsive one, inexplicable to those who do not share it, useful only accidentally, only secondarily, in the way that any compulsion tries to justify itself.\nDidion was a compulsive notetaker and eavesdropper. Because of this, we get stories about: the Los Angeles Santa Ana, a party in Beverly Hills, a story of Sacramento, a \"hallucinatory\" view of New York, a riff \"on morality,\" a behind-the-scenes look at a Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, an intense look at acid, alcohol, promiscuity, and all of the hurt that evolves with flashing. Some things we see, we know we'll never see again.I loved reading \"Goodbye to All That,\" Didion's meditation on New York City, a place she loved and loathed, the city wherein she lost herself. Yet my favorite essay was \"Where the Kissing Never Stops,\" an essay which allowed me to view myself, to think about those intrinsic values placed aside for work; after all, isn't this the beauty of the personal essay, that it teaches us something about ourselves? I found oneness with Joan Beaz, the artist, humanitarian, renegade, and recluse; the woman whose life Didion explores in this piece. Perhaps this is one of those essay collections that leaves each of us with something of ourselves:\nThe roles assigned to her are various, but variations on a single theme. She is the Madonna of the disaffected. She is the pawn of the protest movement. She is the unhappy analysand. She is the singer who would not train her voice, the rebel who drives the Jaguar too fast, the Rima who hides with the birds and the deer. Above all, she is the girl who 'feels' things, who has hung on to the freshness and pain of adolescence, the girl ever wounded, ever young."], ["This is Joan's first essay collection, and the focus is largely on California, in the 1960s, with a few exceptions. I love her ability to write about people and to connect them to specific places. It feels like a time capsule about a place that doesn't exist the same way anymore, at least not completely. Even the Santa Ana winds may have changed."], ["I realize what is disturbing about these essays and what leaves the acrid aftertaste on the leftist tongue about Didion. And I don't think it has much to do with her relatively measured take on the drug-addled Haight-Ashbury scene. For better, but admittedly and sadly often for worse, the radical leftist imagination has been characterized by a willingness and a desire to leap out of our skin into the skin of others, to experience a jump of radical empathy in which the concerns of \"they\" become the concerns of \"we,\" to see through many eyes the way Virginia Woolf allows us to do. Which is why, especially if we are white, we vilify our roots because we often see in our own family histories, a palimpsest of larger histories of injustice and oppression. We have a melancholic view of history, in which moments of utopian potential are consistently being snuffed out in the name of \"order\" and \"tradition,\" the very values, in other words, which Didion spent much of her time in the 1960s eulogizing. She is writing funeral speeches for the passing of milieus whose only apparent meaningfulness is that they are connected to her own biography. Why we should lament the disappearance of the pathetic stagings and affectations of a dusty fake aristocracy is not clear to me, why we should take the survivalist grit of the pioneer generation as ethical models for the present even less so. The Indians are amongst us, protect your own, defend your lifestyle against all costs. These are the imperatives of the Right, old and new, Goldwater and Bush. Circle the wagons against the strange and the new. I admire Didion for the razorblade incisiveness of her critique but her unwillingness to open her subjectivity up to the world makes it difficult to think of her as an ally."], ["In reading the essays in Slouching Towards Bethlehem, I feel a vague sense of unease. Within each essay, there is some revelation of anxiety or untruth. Within every person, there is a moment of quiet desperation. Within a the placid calm of a country marriage, there is a murder. Within each city, there lie feelings of lost hope and disillusionment. Within each person, there is some quiet desperation. In reading these essays, some rough beast has come 'round at last. Didion's style is taut, but repetitive, and can persuade by force of rhetoric alone. Yet for all of her stylistic skill, I cannot but feel there is some broader deficiency in her outlook. She makes the idealism and short-sighted hedonism of the hippies look ridiculous, but they are such an easy target. The whole collection speaks internally of nostalgia and of something lost, but I'm not sure if this dreamworld ever existed."], ["Joan Didion is an insightful and skeptical thinker, an astute ironist, and a beautiful prose stylist: Slouching Towards Bethlehem exemplifies her craft. While all of her essays are exemplary in form, some fall by the wayside of memory, and even only a week removed from my first foray in Didion, only a few remain with me with any moving power. Slouching Towards Bethlehem skirts the two worlds of my known (intimacy) and my unknown (distance): what it means to be a twentysomething, a skeptic, a thinker, an observational outsider-insider, a reader, and the world of the 1960s: the vestigial mirage of the American dream, and the fairy-dust optimism particular to California (and to drug-addicts).I had held off reading Didion for a while, because more than I knew about her writing, I knew about her celebrity. The Joan Didion of 2013: the sheepish-looking neuresthenic of the upper-upper crust, with silver tableware and imported china, damask upholstery on ormulu footed furniture, does not invite sympathy nor empathy. She has become her own horror, a self-damaging neuralgia grown completely inward into herself. But the Didion of Slouching Towards Bethlehem (and, I hope, The White Album which I plan to read sometime soon) is a different sort of woman: one which balances the Janus faces of reflection: inward as well as outward. Much of this collection is a reflection on external, cultural phenomena: a murder case in Southern California, the alluring celebrity of John Wayne, the apotheosis of marriage in Las Vegas, the drugs and counterculture of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, and she develops a personal narrative about it: how she is affected by these phenomena, and what it meant to be exposed to them. Her essays have a literary flair, which court Fitzgerald-esque lyricism and Hemingway-an precision, exactness: her essays are thoroughly American, of an American rhythm and tempo, with a focus on the corroding core of the \"American dream.\"A particularly resonant essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" describes Didion's eight-year sojourn in New York City, when she was twenty up through twenty-eight. \none of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened before.\nAs a twenty-three year old (recently initiated, adieu, twenty-two) I understand the conviction that what one feels, one is the first to feel, perhaps the only one ever to feel: all emotions feel unique, curried with the salt of freedom. If young childhood is the realm of dominant solipsism, young adult hood is the era of narcissism, egoism. It is necessary, I think, to go through this deeply narcissistic phase: we must, at sometime, be the true heroes of our life stories: alone and valiant like Odysseus. At twenty-something, the consequences of our actions are minor, we are yet-formed, yet-completed, we are free to fall and free to rise, but still free to be forgiven. In this period of our lives we must design and build a genuine ego, to replace the mask of entitlement and privilege of youth. Everything which is new is new only by our point of reference: ourselves, and impossible to conceive the true universality of it in the present. Literature, history, makes us feel often that we are not alone, that what we are feeling is rooted in something which is universal, eternal: but we still believe that we have a unique strain, an undiscovered permutation of the human condition.Didion's essays On Self-Respect, On Morality, On Keeping a Notebook reveal the narcissistic compulsions of young adulthood: an age wherein we pen (figuratively and sometimes literally for the diary-inclined) the narrative of out life-stories, and also develop the character which we will assume. What draws people to literature, to story-telling, to TV and movies, is our desperate need for linearity in life. We understand the beginning-middle-end mentality, the rhythm of narratives is very comforting to us. We are a profoundly moralizing species, and narratives help us find meaning, even if it is artificial, created, posed: it comforts us to think that every action has an equal and opposite re-action, we are comforted by the abstract concept of justice, and the practice of it when it is in our favor. Didion acknowledges this compulsion:\nI know something about dread myself, and appreciate the elaborate systems with which some people fill the void, appreciate all the opiates of the people, whether they are as accessible as alcohol and heroin and promiscuity or as hard to come by as faith in God or History.\nAs humans, we need some escape, or if not escape overtly, some structure which guards us from the brutal chaos of reality. We conceive of ourselves heroes, we are heroically justified, our self-respect buds, we become a solitary wanderer, discoverer, thinker, inventor: we measure ourselves by our potential, not necessarily by our accomplishments.\nTo have that sense of one's intrinsic worth which constitutes self-respect is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate, to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference.\n Self-respect, according to Didion, is a \"moral nerve\" - those with self-respect \"have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things.\" It is in the golden era of our lives, our twenties, when we are forced to pay for things: our material needs with money, and our mistakes with our self-respect. There is not currency so valuable as self-respect, and no wealth which is harder to regain when it has been lost.I was moved, was empathetic, to what Didion has to say about her life, particularly her more personal essays. Her descent into neurotic inwardness is perhaps the extreme condition of her reflexive mastery in her earlier essays and works: for it is this aspect which shines. She is coolly self-aware at the age of thirty-two, where she has become a prisoner of her own privilege and self-communion in her later years. \nI think we are well-advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind's door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were."], ["Days after Manson died, I kept thinking about him, how he and his Family had summoned the darkness at the heart of the Summer of Love. I remembered how surprised we all were, that the drugs and the smiles and the flowers had come to this, but then I thought, no, not all of us. Joan Didion would have understood; Joan Didion would not have been surprised.Slouching Toward Bethlehem, a collection of magazine essays and Didion\u2019s second book, is about many things, but mostly it is about \u201860\u2019s California. In its first section \u201cLife Styles in the Golden Land\u201d\u2014slightly longer than half the book--every piece but one is set in California: a San Bernadino Valley murder, profiles of California icons (John Wayne, Joan Baez, Howard Hughes), characteristic California political institutions (the Communist splinter group the CPUSA, the now defunct liberal think tank the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions), and the California nexus of the Hippie Explosion, San Franciso\u2019s Haight-Ashbury district during the Summer of Love. (Even the short piece not set in California, \u201cMarrying Absurd,\u201d about the Las Vegas wedding industry, is also about California and its culture too.)But the California connection does not stop there. Didion was a product of the Sacramento Valley, the descendant of settlers who\u2014before the Gold Rush\u2014crossed the plains in a covered wagon (Joan\u2019s great-great-great grandmother travelled with the Donner party, but, unlike the Donners, her family avoided the fatal short cut and instead followed the old Oregon Trail.) Thirty additional pages of Bethlehem, some of the most personal of the book, describe her California and how it has shaped her character and her perspective.. She recognizes that, even for a Native Daughter like herself, the oldest of California traditions are too recent to constitute roots, that the culture of the \u201860\u2019s Golden Land is always changing: from orange groves to real estate to aerospace (and, later, to high tech and beyond). In her title essay, Didion lays bare the predispositions of the lost freeway children who inhabit the Haight in the late '60's: aimless, disconnected from culture, lacking the principles that might help them fashion a viable alternative, they are people for whom any hypnogogic amusement, any superficial enlightment, even a dark savior, will do.You can learn much about the \u201860\u2019s from this book, but its real pleasure lies in its elegant, sinewy prose. If there is a single clumsy sentence in this book, I failed to find it (and I am one of those irritating fellows who looks). Here is just a taste, from \u201cSome Dreamers of the Golden Dream,\u201d a description of the San Bernardino Valley:\nThis is the California where it is easy to Dial-A-Devotion, but hard to buy a book.\u00a0 This is the country in which a belief in the literal interpretation of Genesis has slipped imperceptibly into a belief in the literal interpretation of Double Indemnity, the country of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for whom all life's promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and return to hairdressers' school.\u00a0 \u201cWe were just crazy kids\u201d they say without regret, and look to the future.\u00a0 The future always looks good in the golden land, because no one remembers the past.\u00a0 Here is where the hot wind blows and the old ways do not seem relevant, where the divorce rate is double the national average and where one person in every thirty-eight lives in a trailer.\u00a0 \u00a0Here is the last stop for all those who\u00a0 come from somewhere else, for all those who drifted away from the cold and the past and the old ways.\u00a0 Here is where they are trying to find a new life style, trying to find it in the only places they know to look:\u00a0 the movies and the newspapers."], ["I don't mean to be super fangirl about this collection, because a lot of the essays were fine but didn't blow my socks off. However, the ones that I really liked? I really fucking liked. And I know that a couple of months from now, probably even a few years from now, even with my shitty-shit memory, I will look back at this collection and think happy thoughts because of the essays that made my little Grinch heart explode into brightly flavored fireworks of flowers and sunshine and unicorns.I don't mean to be dismissive about the essays that I thought were merely fine, but that's probably how it will come across. Let's just lay out here: I don't care that much about California. I know people who live there, one of my brothers used to live there, that's all great, they're good people. But when I think about places I have an active interest in visiting, California isn't high on that list. Even when a lovely person like Joan Didion writes about California, it doesn't make me want to hop on a plane and head there. So those essays didn't do so much for me, much like her other collection, Where I Was From, didn't do so much for me. I blame all of this not on Didion or her writing, but the entire state of California. Because, duh.That's right, California, I'm throwing shade your way.There's that one, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, for which this collection is named, that was really powerful. Didion spent time with the hippies of the original Sixties in Haight-Ashbury, and okay. That was a really decent essay. But that was more about Haight-Ashbury and counter-culture than it was about California.But the other ones that were amazing and did funny things to my heart were the ones that were even more personal, personal to Didion and to who Didion is as a person. Most of the entire second section, Personals, made me nod out of familiarity. I knew exactly what she was talking about. On Keeping a Notebook, an essay every notebook-keeper should read; On Self-Respect; On Morality; On Going Home. And in the final section, Seven Places of the Mind (such a great section title), the final essay, Goodbye to All That hit me in all the feels. ALL THE FEELS, guys.I want to curl up with this book and re-read all my favorites over and over again. But right now I can't even.So five glowing stars for the ones I liked the most and I'll just pretend the other ones that felt lackluster in comparison were from that other essay collection of hers that I gave two stars."]], "review_count": "1427", "description": "This classic collection of journalism defined the state of America during the upheaval of the sixties revolution. The essays feature barricades and bombings, mass murders and kidnapped heiresses.", "author": "Joan Didion"}, "Pyramids of Montauk: Explorations in Consciousness": {"average_rating": "3.91", "review": [["First, a brief harangue. I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again. 'In three variants on the classic detective story, Paul Auster makes the well-traversed terrain of New York city his own, as it becomes a strange, compelling landscape in which identities merge or fade and questions serve only to further obscure the truth.'I stayed on in the house for a few more days. My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place.

Quella degli esuli cubani a Miami \u00e8 una comunit\u00e0 politicamente artefatta che ha vissuto diversi decenni in una favola o dentro un'opera teatrale: la trama (ai loro occhi) era il tradimento subito.Parla dell'exilio come di un rituale, una tradizione rispettata, e una visione della politica cos\u00ec centrale per la condizione umana che per descriverla sembravano non esserci parole adatte nel vocabolario della maggior parte degli americani. L'invasione della baia dei Porci fu organizzata dalla CIA durante l'amministrazione Eisenhower, con tanto di addestramento militare di esuli cubani, ma Kennedy diventato presidente decise di non sostenere il piano.

The swampy feel, however, was both a plus (atmosphere) and a negative (narrative-flow). This book reminds me of the feeling I got when reading Delillo's Libra or Mailer's Oswald's TaleThis book is a dark, wet narrative of paranoia, government conspiracies, and a nation and city that has lost control of its dark arts. It is still relevant and the paranoia is still rich. I was reading this book and the character of Jack Wheeler sounded interesting. I remember he had been a figure in Rick Atkinson's [book:The Long Gray Line. He advised President Reagan and Both President Bushes on Central America. So, I decided to look him up since, like Zelig, he also played an interesting part in Didion's book. 23 years after Didion's 'Miami' was published and 4 years before I read it, Jack Wheeler was killed while conducting a review of the legal authority to engage in nation-state offensive cyberwarfare. His body was seen by a landfill worker \"falling onto a trash heap in the Cherry Island Landfill\". Sounds like it could have happened in Miami."], ["The first third of Miami seemed to promise nothing more than amusing reportage\u2014when drug traffickers go house-hunting they look for private water access; Tony Montana became a mythic hero almost the instant Scarface premiered\u2014but then it began to hit much harder. Didion is so good that any subject she takes up seems her destined one, the exclusive focus of her brooding brilliance; but reading Miami I was tempted to narrow things down and say she\u2019s truly in her element among covert missions and counterrevolutionary conspiracy, and at her very best when relating brutal ops to the amnesiac innocence projected by our actor-leaders, when contrasting the frank machismo of Washington\u2019s surrogates with Washington\u2019s own circular, coquettish language of power\u2014\u201ca language in which deniability was built into the grammar.\u201d Her presentation of the fraught marriage of the \u201csacrificial and absolutist\u201d Cuban politicos and pragmatic, desultory Imperial Washington makes this book a keeper.In many ways, Miami remains our graphic lesson in consequences. \u201cI can assure you that this flag will be returned to this brigade in a free Havana,\u201d John F. Kennedy said at the Orange Bowl in 1962\u2026meaning it as an abstraction, a rhetorical expression of a collective wish; a kind of poetry, which of course makes nothing happen. \u201cWe will not permit the Soviets and their henchmen in Havana to deprive others of their freedom,\u201d Ronald Reagan said at the Dade County Auditorium in 1983, and then Ronald Reagan, the first American president since John F. Kennedy to visit Miami in search of Cuban support, added this: \u201cSomeday, Cuba itself will be free.\u201dThis was of course just more poetry, another rhetorical expression of the same collective wish, but Ronald Reagan, like John F. Kennedy before him, was speaking here to people whose historical experience had not been that poetry makes nothing happen.Perhaps what I mean to say is that Didion writes particularly well about politics\u2014 because, I now see, with a glance back to her famous 1960s-themed collections, she is really a connoisseur of the fantasies fermenting in our rhetoric\u2014rhetoric that can be taken literally or deployed symbolically, instrumentally\u2014and she has a deep appreciation of personalities and subcultures for whom political speech is an exhilaration, a medium of metaphysics.That the wish to see Fidel Castro removed from power in Cuba did not in itself constitute a political philosophy was a point rather more appreciated in el exilio, which had as its legacy a tradition of considerable political sophistication, than in Washington, which tended to accept the issue as an idea, and so to see Cuban exiles as refugees not just from Castro but from politics. In fact exile life in Miami was dense with political distinctions, none of them exactly in the American grain. Miami was for example the only American city I had ever visited in which it was not unusual to hear one citizen describe the position of another as \u201cFalangist,\u201d or as \u201cessentially Nasserite.\u201d There were in Miami exiles who defined themselves as communists, anti-Castro. There were in Miami a significant number of exile socialists, also anti-Castro. There were in Miami two prominent groups of exile anarchists, many still in their twenties, all anti-Castro, and divided from one another, I was told, by \u201cpersonality differences,\u201d \u201cpersonality differences\u201d being the explanation Cubans tend to offer for anything from a dinner-table argument to a coup.This urge toward the staking out of increasingly recondite positions, traditional to exile life in Europe and Latin America, remained, in South Florida, exotic, a nervous urban brilliance not entirely apprehended by local Anglos, who continued to think of exiles as occupying a fixed place on the political spectrum, one usually described as \u201cright-wing\u201d or \u201cultraconservative\u201d\u2026Still, \u201cright-wing,\u201d on the American spectrum, where political positions were understood as marginally different approaches to what was seen as a shared goal, seemed not to apply. This was something different, a view of politics as so central to the human condition that there may be no applicable words in the vocabulary of most Americans. Virtually every sentient member of the Miami exile community was on any given day engaged in what was called an \u201cideological confrontation\u201d with some other member of the Miami exile community\u2026Reminds me of Nabokov\u2019s complaint that Western Europeans and Americans always pictured exiled Russians as former ladies-in-waiting to the Czarina or reactionary, monocle-wearing counts\u2014when, as just one sample of the complexity of that emigration, Nabokov\u2019s paternal grandfather had been Minister of Justice to one Czar; his father had been imprisoned by the next Czar, and then assassinated in Berlin by royalist fellow exiles; and though descended from a deeply anti-Semitic aristocracy, his wife was Jewish, as was his closest literary associate, an editor prominent in the Socialist Revolutionary party, anti-Lenin. I don\u2019t like Castro and can think of few figures more tiresome than Che Guevara, but I have always found it all too easy to picture many of the first-generation Cuban exiles as rightist goons; but now, perhaps no less facilely, I see them in the long roll of \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d\u2014\u201cterrorists\u201d when the wind changes\u2014trained and temporarily utilized by the United States, promised much, and then strung along, diverted, their struggles, causes, and plucky wars of independence supported and fulsomely publicized only while it was expedient to do so: the black soldiers who bled for the Union only to be abandoned to sharecropping and Jim Crow; the Native American scouts and guides who ended up on reservations just like the tribes that resisted; the Cuban and Filipino nationalists whose brief interval of independence from Spain was quashed by their North American allies and \u201cliberators\u201d; the mujahedeen at grips with the Soviets; the Iraqi Shiites and Kurds after the first Gulf War. I mean, I know her husband and daughter died, and that kind of thing deserves a memoir, or two, even, and I know she\u2019s frail and aged\u2026but if she published a book on Baghdad or mercenaries or drones or Karzai or anything else in this mess, I\u2019d buy it in a second. I\u2019m an asshole\u2026sorry!"], ["This was a thrift store offer I couldn't refuse; a Joan Didion book I'd never heard of for a nickel. But did I really care to read her impressionistic musings on the city of Miami (as of the mid-1980s, when this was penned) and the complicated influence/history of the Cuban-exile community on it? Maybe not, but Didion hooked me right off the bat.Reading the comments of some others here, I find some predictable grousing about Didion being as a sort of female, white-privileged, racist interloper; thus inherently unqualified, evidently, to observe and study and engage the town and its people to come up with her own informed impressions and well-laid-out reportage. Sorry, folks, but until someone in the \"community\" writes a study this clear, this entertaining, this precise, this thoughtful and this fleet and comprehensible on the subject -- as well as this cheap and easily obtainable (it was a national bestseller) -- I'm giving Didion the benefit of the doubt. Not that I have any. She can write, and anyone who wants to attack her artistry can come at me full bore and enjoy my wrath.The other criticism I've seen on here, which is an ongoing pet peeve of mine, is that the book is allegedly \"dated,\" as if a book written at a certain time period, about said time period and the years before it, has no value. History books written about history and about the history of their time aren't dated, whatever that even means. The fact that things have happened since is not the fault of the author and doesn't reflect on the quality or value of the information therein and its interpretation. It's an idiotic criticism, usually forwarded by people who provide no backing or context or any real substance, or who can't articulate a real deficiency in the book. Reminding us of bygone times is not dated. If you lived in the 1980s and ever had big hair or watched Family Ties, then you're dated! See what I mean? Irrelevant.What Didion gets at, rather unconventionally and in a breathless, whirlwind manner, is the psyche of a town like none other in the nation. A town split by class and racial divides and more than half populated by a unique community of exiles in an uneasy peace with their ostensible benefactors -- an exile community that is even at war with itself, grappling with idea of exile, about the idea of repatriation, about the futility of lost homeland and the passion of restoration. In painting her portrait, Didion actually comes to timeless observations, particularly about the American political monster that has not much changed from the time of Reagan to the time of Trump. A lot of what she observes in the book remains unchanged and the portents she hints at are eerie. This is not just a book about Miami and its Cuban exiles, but also about the nation as a whole, about the way Washington and provincial politics make strange bedfellows who continue down the same misguided road to the same foreign policy disasters. In the case of the Cuban exiles, Didion explores how duplicitous Washington has promised, deceived and thrown them under the bus, just as the exiles seem to take it in their stride.Didion finds in the Cuban exiles a vitality, passion and sophistication of thought missing in heartland of America. These are some choice passages:\"Americans, at one and the same time, acted exclusively in their own interests and failed to see their own interests, not only because they were undereducated but because they were by temperament 'naive,' a people who could live and die without ever understanding those nuances of conspiracy and allegience on which, in the Cuban view, the world turned.\"(pp. 77-78)\"Miami was ... the only American city I had ever visited in which it was not unusual to hear one citizen describe the position of another as 'Falangist,' or as \"essentially Nasserite.'\"(pp. 128-129)\"Making a choice between terrorism of the Right and terrorism of the Left was incomprehensible to him. Maybe he was right. As time goes by I think that men who were unable to make choices were more right than those who made them. Because there are no clean choices.\" (pp. 148-149; about a Cuban exile radio host drawing comparison between Albert Camus' political thought and the dilemma of Cuban exiles)I would give roughly the first half of Miami five stars for piquant and fetching insight as it races out of the gate in impressionistic style and then settles into impressive reportage, but would downgrade it a bit for morphing overmuch in the last quarter into an analysis of the modus operandi of the Reagan presidency. The conservative attitude in America and its effect on Latin American foreign policy (tied inextricably into the concerns of Miami's Cuban exile community) is necessary for context, but it seems to get too far away from the initial subject of Miami, and the book seems to hang there, ending abruptly.Nonetheless, I learned a lot and would recommend this as go-to entre quick primer on an important and little-understood, or misunderstood, social, cultural and political American phenomenon.(BTW, I smoked a Padron while reading this book... It seemed appropriate).(KR@KY 2017)"], ["Joan Didion's writing is a touchstone in my life, has been since The White Album. This book suits her style to a T, urgent, riveting, exposing the underbelly. She has the same fascination I have with sordid corruption in politics and circles of power, and Miami is a city rampant with both. The Nicaraguan war was basically run from Miami. That has been established not just in this book, but in many others. The CIA and conservative Cuban exiles who fled Castro teamed up and turned the city into a center of black ops. The Cubans in Florida did a lot of dirty work for the CIA in return for empty promises that the US would get rid of Castro. Joan Didion knows where to look, and how to reveal volumes in a few short paragraphs. This book is riveting, and should be part of every U.S. citizen's education about what has been done in their name, and the people who have been our partners in crime."], ["Wow! So as the white Anglo Saxon perspective of a city that successfully blends two cultures it's no surprise to find racism disguised behind the mask of a liberal. What, there are people who don't speak English or agree with my politics, what is America coming to? Didion, who has never lived in South Florida, has written an embarrassing book that will look worse as time passes and America becomes multicultural. At first, this book was extremely addictive and the history aspect of it had me reading chapter after chapter in one sitting. By the end of the book, I was disgusted and wanted to throw it away."], ["This one took me a while to get into. The narrative, if you will, is non-linear, opaque, and often confusing and contradictory sounding. But that's the point. Didion stirs a tropical cauldron of politics, actions, laments, lies and reversals. The end result is a heat-dream snapshot of a Miami often closer culturally to Cuba than America."], ["I was raised among Cubans (dated and darn near married a couple) during the period described by Didion, although I was on the other Florida coast (Tampa, and the Cuban community there was a bit different in outlook), and I paid rather close attention to the raucous (destructive) cocaine days and racial discord of that wild city east across the Everglades. Politically Cuban Americans can be an intense people, but personally I have found few as welcoming, generous, boisterous, fun-loving, and warm, even to a \"white bread\" like me. And although the reportage is dated and we have entered a new era (hopefully) with Cuba, and remarkably Castro is still with us, some of the observations are revealing and still accurate, methinks. The title is somewhat misleading, as almost all of it deals with Cuban American issues, from their arrival and expansion (both numerically and in political power) to terrorist activities of its hardened activists. How easy it is to forget our own terrorists. I did like that Didion spent time covering the Cuban American left, spotlighting the opposition and even physical danger (including assassinations and death threats) they endured, especially when they suggested diplomatic approaches to changing Cuban policy. She rightly called out some of the blatant lies that were perpetuated, especially troubling when it comes to the Pedro Pan children. A common theme of complaint is that the United States follows its own policy. Duh. A few times I had the feeling that the book was cobbled together from articles she may have written, and a better editor would have struck some repetitive material, but overall I found a lot that was interesting. But I would have liked a bit broader examination of the town, the gay community, the strip, the nightlife, perhaps even a little on the Dolphins, the U., the wealthy, the Jewish influences, perhaps even the retirees. Maybe even something on the tourists, and boosterism. My goodness, there is so much, and obviously she chose to narrow her focus, but I wanted more."], ["I really enjoyed this book, which was nothing if not well researched and structured. I appreciated how Didion started small, with the city itself, and grew the book outward, to encompass not just Cuba but other Central and South American countries, as well as other American cities, especially Washington. Her picture of interconnectedness was fabulous, and her diction also great. She used a great deal of repetition in both word and phrase, which I appreciated, as she I'd it when the emphasis was most dire - and it often was.There were a few things I wasn't crazy about. Mainly, her penchant for separating the main sentence with a million dependent clauses, especially in sentences that were often a paragraph, even a page, long. Several times in each chapter, these sentences were so convoluted that in lost her train of thought and had to reread sections. While her points were always valuable, they were muddled.I also wasn't crazy for the title, and I wondered if it was chosen more for marketing reasons than anything else - that a book with a one-word title would seem less academic, more NYT best seller. Because the book was about more, and less, than Miami. It was about very specifically Cuban emigre Miami. Other races, ethnicities, and cultures were referred to only insofar as they related to the Cuban experience. And while I think that is fine, as it created an extremely interesting book, I feel like the title is misleading of subject. It should have either had a subtitle, or been called something more like \"Cuban Miami.\""], ["Didion continues to be my favorite non-fiction author. The precision of her language matches the precision of her analysis, whether she's describing on the micro scale of how minute gestures of an interviewee reveal their worldview, or the macro scale of Washington politics in the Reagan era. Here (circa '87) she's plumbing the gulf between Miami's Cuban and Anglo populations, and the complicated relation of Cuban anti-Castro militants to Washington, \"la lucha\" (the struggle) and each other. Many fascinating characters, stories, counter-stories and observations.In her earlier book Salvador, I think Didion allowed the terrifying absurdities she witnessed to overcome her willingness to analyze. Here, though she is still dealing with complicated and murky subject matter, she emerges with some clear conclusions about how Washington's abstractions create its own monsters, and there's a chilling and prophetic underlining of this when, in a Washington conservative think-tank presentation about rolling back the Soviet empire ('87, remember), she notes the character of Jack Wheeler drumming up support for the Islamic mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan."]], "review_count": "73", "description": "It is where Fidel Castro raised money to overthrow Batista and where two generations of Castro's enemies have raised armies to overthrow him, so far without success.

Picked it up again at the end of the semester and forced myself to through.All in all his was a fascinating book that did an incredible job capturing the complicated life of an American Immigrant icon.

It almost read like it was letting you in on a secret, at times differentiating what the world saw at a given time and what actually happened (like with all of his feuds and how for decades those who pirated his work were rewarded).What I enjoyed most about this tale was seeing how intertwined he was with the most powerful American families of all time. This was a man who worked with both JP Morgan and Jr. He was a direct rival of Edison and a pen pal of Elenor Roosevelt.I am incredibly happy to have finally finished this book."], ["Nikola Tesla was an amazing genius. He came very close to winning a Nobel Prize, jointly with Edison. Tesla was an brilliant, arrogant, eccentric character, full of energy. He made numerous fundamental scientific discoveries, and tried, to some extent, to capitalize on his discoveries through a whole host of inventions. He obtained many diverse patents, but he had little business sense, and this was exacerbated by corporations that often infringed on his patents without offering compensation. Corporations (Westinghouse, RCA, AT&T, American Marconi) around the turn of the century had only profit as their motive, and honor and honesty was not given even a wink. He was more responsible for wireless communication than Marconi, but to this day people credit Marconi with the invention.On the other hand, Tesla was the quintessential \"mad scientist\". He was often far ahead of his time, and people did not believe his grandiose ideas and grandiose claims. The thing is, he often came through on his grandiose claims. Before issuing a patent for \"teleautomation\", the chief patent examiner insisted on coming to witness Tesla's invention, and saw for himself that it did work. J.P. Morgan initially invested in Tesla's \"wireless\" system so that ships and racing boats could be tracked while at sea. However, Tesla took the investment and proceeded to develop ever-more grand systems to transmit radio waves across the oceans, even around the world. Then, when Tesla started to claim that he was working on wireless transmission of power, Morgan actively discouraged investors. Not because Morgan doubted that Tesla would be successful--on the contrary--he knew that the \"wizard\" would come through on his fantastic claims. Morgan did not believe in distribution of power \"for free.\"Toward the end of his life, Tesla made claims that he had invented a particle-beam death ray. We don't know if it was true--but it did get some attention from the FBI and other government agencies--after he died! And his eccentricity seems to be boundless--he hired people to feed pigeons in public places around New York City.My favorite story is about how, in the very earliest days of his wireless experiments in Colorado Springs, he heard three distinct \"taps\". Tesla attributed the taps to communications from Martians. Later he was told that Marconi had been simultaneously demonstrating to the British Navy a long-range radio transmission. Tesla, though, still held onto his claim that he was receiving messages from Mars!This book contains a wealth of detail about Tesla's life. It quotes many letters and documents written by Tesla, or to Tesla, or about him. Sometimes I felt that the book went into too much detail--it could have been considerably shorter without lessening its impact. The book contains some interesting analyses of Tesla's life, and some speculations as to why Tesla behaved as he did. The book goes into psychoanalytic speculation about reasons why Tesla became so eccentric--reasons having to do with early events in his life, when he grew up in Serbia. Tesla was the uncle of the author's father. Nevertheless, this family relationship does not seem to cloud or bias this biography. Both the good and the less-good points of Tesla's life story are included."], ["This book is actually the reason I can't check out anything at the SF Public Library anymore. I took it out years ago, and by the time I started it, it was due back again. But being the lazy bastard I am, I just kept reading it because it was so engrossing, and never renewed it. Tesla was, next to Da Vinci, probably the purest and most intuitive scientific genius ever to have lived. He was also one of the most paranoid and eccentric, but really everyone knows that is a prerequisite for genius. Seeing how badly Edison screwed him over, and the personal hatred Edison had for him, was shocking, not to mention the experiments Tesla did in Colorado with 'free energy', make it worthwhile. Oh, and he designed and tested all his machines in his head, so they worked perfectly the first time he built them almost always."], ["This was not an easy listen. Over 22 hours dense with information, including technical descriptions of Nikola Tesla's inventions!This being said, I am glad I bought this audiobook. It covers not only Tesla's inventions and ideas but also his cultural background, his relationships with quite a number of the luminaries of the times, as well as his physical and mental health. For this reader/listener with no electrical engineering background, the descriptions of Tesla's inventions and postulated theories, most of which in his own words, were a little hard to understand, let alone evaluate. However, bearing in mind that this is not a scientific appreciation of Tesla's work but his biography, the book fulfilled my desire to know more about Tesla's achievements and why he was transformed into a mythical figure. The technical descriptions were informative enough to give the general reader/listener a fairly good insight into an array of Tesla's inventions, including both the proved and the postulated ones.Therefore, I appreciate Mr. Seifer's efforts to do Nikola Tesla justice, separating the myth built around him from historic facts, fairly pointing out where Tesla was wrong, and thus bringing Tesla's fascinating accomplishments and ideas/postulated theories into proper perspective.I liked how the book was organized. It was set chronologically, yet centered on Tesla's world wireless communication system (Wardenclyffe), involving Tesla's desire and efforts to make wireless transmission of power possible (which seems to have stuck in the throat of the electrical engineering companies battling for their share in the market). What I found both interesting and saddening were the descriptions of the competition between inventors, disputes about who was 'the first' and Tesla's struggles against patent infringements. The book renders both Tesla's virtues and his weaknesses, and I must admit that some of Tesla's quirks made me dislike him at times. In spite of it, I found the events leading to the development of radio (the Wireless) most saddening. Tesla aimed valiantly high (ahead of this time), which unfortunately led him to a blind alley and lose the battle with Marconi (though he was able to recover some money in the Courts long after Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics).(view spoiler)[I digress a little, but I couldn't help but laugh at myself when I read Tesla's argument against Einstein's theory of relativity, claiming, \u201cI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. ... Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\u201cWell, as I myself was inclined to refuse to subscribe to such a view, I would recommend Tesla (if he were alive) to read Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore in order to learn how to understand/interpret Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the concept of 'curved space' properly. (hide spoiler)]All in all, I congratulate Mr. Seifer on well researched and fairly even-handed biography of Nikola Tesla. While some of Tesla's postulated inventions, as described, left me wondering whether they were only the product of a brilliant dreamer (in this context, be prepared for a bit of conspiracy theories at the end of the book, regarding Tesla's 'death beam weapon'), the book as a whole succeeded to convince me that this genius deserves better recognition.As my review refers to the audio version of Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius, let me say a word or two about the narration. Simon Prebble's performance is excellent indeed. It suits the times in which Tesla lived, as well as the general mood of the book. I particularly enjoyed how Mr. Prebble voiced Tesla's personal correspondence with J.P. Morgan and others, bringing life and personality to the characters in the book."], ["This book was long. I had my doubts about finishing this one in a month but I ended up wrapping it up in just over a week. Although, that has more to do with Tesla's character and his inventions rather than Author's writing style. Though, to be fair to the Author, he has done a decent job of making the book dramatic enough especially considering it is actually a Biography.It is clear from the book that Tesla was a Brilliant man whose ideas were well ahead of his time. At the same time, book has enough evidence and stories from his life to prove that many of those ideas were not executed to completion by Tesla. It is also clear that Tesla was no genius when it came to his social skills and financial management. This book makes you wonder what more greater inventions this great (sometimes also called mad) scientist could've done for man kind, if he had at least one of those two skills. Personally for me, the best (and partly sad) part of the book were Tesla's and J.P Morgan's exchanges. Frankly, I really do not think either J.P or Tesla were wrong in what they did. Tesla had really a lot to prove since he had no practical application of most of the claims he was making and Morgan was trying to be what he is, a Businessman. The desperation in Tesla's tone in those letters to J.P Morgan clearly presents the state of his mind in those days. In spite of that, it is commendable that Tesla's objective was more or less to bring about a Revolution in the Wireless Systems. It is even more admiring because of the fact that most of his contemporaries especially Edison, Marconi etc were bad mouthing Tesla in the scientific community and were always on the look out for ways to bring him down.Other than this, the other interesting parts were stories about Westinghouse and RCA's formation, Tesla's rivalry with Edison and Marconi, Tesla's views on Einstein's theory of relativity, World war and its impacts on US policies on Patent Infringement and many more. It is a shame that Tesla (and Edison) never won a Nobel Prize especially considering that other people who actually build their inventions using his ideas went on to get a Nobel Prize and also lived a much more financially stable life than him.Overall, I would say the book is good. Just keep in mind the fact that it is a Biography and that the Author might not be highly qualified to give you all the technical details about Tesla's inventions."], ["This was a good but difficult book. The author is intent on putting down in meticulous detail the life of this amazing character and in doing so skips around with chaotic effect. Tesla knew and interacted with many famous people of his time and it was hard keeping track of his interactions with them as the author related stories and jumped from one character to another.The author relates in detail the many inventions and ideas that Nikola Tesla advanced that were subsequently used by other inventors who gave no credit to Tesla and in fact stole his ideas. There are many instances depicted where Tesla is depicted as constantly fighting to convince the world that his ideas were stolen by other famous inventors. There are chapters which begin with one topic and then switch for no particular reason to another seemingly unrelated topic.There are things I liked about the book. I liked reading about Teslas conviction that he could communicate with Mars and how he had a vision of the world wide web and cellular communication. I was fascinated with the struggles Tesla had in the Wardenclyffe project.I liked the depiction of Teslas relationship to Katherine Underwood Johnson and would have liked a more satisfying telling of that relationship. The author simply announces at one point a list of people who died and Katherine is among this list. This is the main problem I had with this book. The organization requires better editing.Another aspect of the book that turned me off was the constant detail concerning monetary and financial problems. It seems like Tesla was constantly concerned with obtaining funding for his many inventions. I suppose this is the plight of many an inventor but I would have preferred less detailing of this (to me) boring topic.Although I struggled with this book, I did enjoy reading about this great man's life and work and would recommend this book for anyone interested in Nikola Tesla."], ["Tesla is one of the most awesomest coolio scientists evah. Totally. Check out what The Oatmeal has to say: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla.And if you're writing your dissertation on Tesla and need to know whether he was in New Jersey or New York on April 19th so that you can confirm that a conversation really took place, this is the book for you. It's great at that level of documentation. On the other hand, if you want to read about how awesomely coolio Tesla was, this book may make you want to gouge your eyes out.I do not need to know which of his instructors at university was mustachioed and which had a full head of hair. Really, really do not. Do not care. Yet I really care about Tesla - I'd love to learn more about him. This book is not the means to that end for me. The minutia killed it for me.I'd give it three stars because it obviously gives historical information that people want, but I'm mad about the way it made me feel. Admittedly I'm not an engineer and don't know a whole lot about electricity. But I'm not stupid - I read a lot of books about various branches of science. But this book was so overwhelmingly tedious that it made me want to read a picture book about Tesla. Or a pop-up book! That would be fun! I just wanted to get to the good stuff, and I felt superficial in the face of this dense collection of minutia. The emphasis on tiny unimportant (to my mind) details lessened the impact of Tesla's discoveries and inventions. The elevation of the unimportant made the important seem flat. I wasn't able to maintain my attention, and also was wearied by the effort required to sift through to find the interesting stuff.So only two stars. Tesla, though: 17 stars."], ["When I review a biography, I usually start by saying \"look how awesome this guy is\" and then rambling about his appearance, his style, etc.Well, look how awesome this guy is. He's like a more dashing Marcel Proust. He's got a handsome but not showy mustachio. He's got that cool oiled hair thing going on.But Tesla's coolness is more about his showmanship. He took this terrifying, new thing called electricity, stuff that comes down from the sky and explodes trees and cows, and he just sits there reading a magazine while it rages around him. Or he'll walk out on a stage into the midst of bolts of electricity, walking through it like it's a waterfall instead of magical death light, protected only by the cork lining his shoes.And it's not just Tesla's wacky experiments that make him so compelling. It's his personality and his history of hardships. He's a tragic figure, the Melville of science, who ran into some fame and fortune, but was ultimately condemned to a life of struggle and a death alone in a hotel room.I won't force you to read this book. But you should at least read the Wikipedia article because this dude is really interesting."], ["I\u2019m still looking for the definitive biography on Nikola Tesla because rest assured this isn\u2019t it.The author throws non-essential information about like it was confetti. I knew from the first chapter when he starts with the history of Croatia that this would be a less than promising beginning. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t get any better. People keep cropping up who had very little contact with or influence on Tesla. Information on his discoveries are kept to a minimum while matters of who filed what patent and when go on ad nauseum. There\u2019s very little real science involved. It\u2019s amazing how many times the author strays off the subject to bring up a trivial piece of data I could\u2019ve lived the rest of my life without knowing. I\u2019m willing to bet that overall more of the text is not about Tesla. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a book about such a creative genius could be balled up to the point of practically making it unreadable. Cripes! Please, somebody write a really good biography of this man who deserves better than the treatment here."], ["I'm embarrassed to admit it, but before reading this book, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had pretty much bought into the new age mythology that Tesla was a mystic genius visionary who was the victim of Edison's jealous, evil industrialist thievery and sabotage. Now, after reading accounts of Tesla's embarrassing social, financial and professional missteps, his ridiculous pleading correspondences to J.P. Morgan (and other wealthy would-be benefactors), and less than half baked journal submissions (particularly the one that interpreted a three beat radio transmission as a communication from intelligent extra terrestrials), I'm seeing Tesla in a whole new light. Rather than a victim of conspiratorial thuggery, I now see Tesla as a victim of his own chronic douchiness.Tesla was clearly decades ahead of his peers. But being \"ahead of your time\", contrary to hipster dogma, is not necessarily a good thing. Tesla had amazing ideas. But good ideas without good execution are about useless, where as even mediocre ideas, well executed, can at least be useful to someone. Tesla was with out a doubt, an amazing inventor. But it's hard not to feel like he could have achieved so much more if he wasn't such a dysfunctional, self sabotaging, grandiose douche bag.This book is a well done (if a little long) biography of a fascinating (to say the least) character from a fascinating time. But the real value of the book is as a cautionary tale of how unchecked cognitive biases (see: confirmation bias) and magical thinking can be the undoing of even brilliant and talented people like Tesla. Be warned; if your model of reality becomes too divorced from actual reality, you may needlessly fritter away your hard work and talent on some really ridiculous shit. Read this book, particularly if you like biographies of scientists, but if you're one of those Tesla worshipers, be prepared to deify the guy a whole lot less upon completion. Ultimately, the book renders a portrait of Tesla that is humane and realistic. Uncovering Tesla's scammy shenanigans, unexamined self delusions and outrageous foibles, while concurrently celebrating his incredible creativity and authentic brilliance.BTW: a film is in production starring (self serious, tortured) Christian Bale as Tesla. I think (brilliant, trixter, clown) Sacha Baron-Cohen would make for a better, more realistic, funner film."]], "review_count": "5", "description": "Recounts the life and accomplishments of the Croatian-born engineer who developed alternating-current technology and invented the radio.", "author": "Carol Dommermuth-Costa"}, "Mason & Dixon": {"average_rating": "4.05", "review": [["What to say or where to start saying things about this book? Pynchon\u2019s language is unceasingly beautiful; Mason and Dixon are as endearing and animated with pure character as any creations you\u2019ll meet; the book perfectly balances cartoonish absurdity with gently profound melancholy in a rich musical vocabulary; the page is to the prose as air is to music played; the book is inhabited by dream-beings and ghosts and the fantastic, because its realm is pure story; story into story into story; I would want it to go on forever, but it ends in the most perfect stretch of pages; I\u2019ll quote another Goodreads reviewer \u201cThomas Pynchon just broke my heart\u201d; it stayed with me when it was closed and I mentioned Mason and Dixon, as people, to people I spoke to; I went to the Atlantic Ocean (this really happened three days ago) and saw a sign for a trailer park right as we crossed the border into the Delaware marshes, when the sunset was lighting them all on fire, that read \u201cMason-Dixon\u201d; secret thrills were given me because I was born and raised in the Old Line State; it perfectly caught like lightning bug light that feeling we have when under the night sky and the stars are bright and numberless and that reminds us of all the space out there for dying or forgetting or for thinking of ages past or passing; because it was long, it felt like reading lifetimes; because it had such depth I lost myself in concentrating on it; it is a perfect novel about friendship; I came across passages of staggering beauty abutting slapstick buffoonery; the book is geminiacal, bipolar, its fabric is opposites, twins, mates, the vast or minuscule space that acts as their boundaries and borders, what separates their bodies and separately gives them form and identity; it is a loping colloquy between Faith and its mate Reason, Free Will and its mate Fate; I read in it that I should make my way West to go with the day, with Time, maturation, aging, having children, the coming of the next generation, the slow fading and dispersal at sunset- and East if I wish to go against the day, into the past, toward morning, the smokeless altars of memory, to youth\u2026 where we can\u2019t ever stay for long, because the terrain has started to go missing, there is less firm land under foot to hold and lift us, and our Lines must again resume their inexorable Westerly course...~~~~~~~~"], ["All Due Regard to LengthLet's get the length of \"Mason & Dixon\" out of the way first.Lauding fiction on the basis of its maximalism alone might gratify those who derive satisfaction from this one feature of big fat books, but it inevitably deters readers who might enjoy the (other) merits of the book.I was a little apprehensive about the length of this novel when I began. However, the preoccupation with its length obscures what a pleasure it is to read (and why).Here, Thomas Pynchon gives us the essence of both challenging and rewarding literature, but on a grand scale: immaculate sentence construction, authentic world-building, engaging story-telling and belletristic narrative meta/heterogeneity, all delivered with a sustained Rabelaisian energy and sly quixotic eroticism. Write on, Tom!Up to His Usual MischiefWhatever the intellect that went into the construction of this fiction, it's still and always a joy to read. This is what, for me, differentiates Pynchon from his peers. He's fun, playful, cheeky, mischievous, sometimes even outrageous.From time to time, his work might be matched by John Barth and Robert Coover, but you have to question whether the sheer literary inventiveness of Pynchon's oeuvre as a whole (book for book) could ever be surpassed by any of the other Post-Modern American poster-boys, the ones who continually and hyperblurbally get wheeled out as the Greatest Writer or the Greatest Sentence-Fabricator of their Generation (somebody please remind me why we're always being told who is the Greatest and/or Longest by white male pundits, discoverers, spruikers, list-makers, proclaimers and long lost book club members, when perhaps the word \"favourite\" would do).Sometimes it's the way you praise Caesar that buries him.Surface BreakdownYes, it feels like you're holding a compact brick at first. It's just over 770 pages long, but there are 78 chapters of more or less 10 pages each. Hence, you can read and digest each one quite quickly. Immediately, you want to move onto the next, like links in a chain. No sooner would I look at the page number than I would find I'd read 40 or 50 pages. Pretty soon, I was trying to finish 100 pages a day.It Was Fun While It LastedThe language is that of the late 18th century. Sentences are long, but neatly divided by commas and dashes into phrases and clauses that propel you along.Once you get into the rhythm of the writing, you forget about its archaisms, and you start to recognise and enjoy the abundant wit and humour. It's fun, in anybody's time, space and language. As Pynchon conveys in verse:\"It...was...funWhile it lasted,And it lasted,Quite a while...\"In other words, maximalism is better served with merriment and whimsy than earnestness and self-absorption.The Mason and Dixon LineYou don't have to know anything about Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to appreciate the novel. Equally, if you learned about them at school and don't want to know any more, then the novel can still be entertaining.Throughout its expanse, the Mason and Dixon Line is an extended metaphor for the artificial boundaries that divide and conquer people:\"To rule forever, it is necessary only to create, among the people one would rule, what we call...Bad History. Nothing will produce Bad History more directly nor brutally, than drawing a Line, in particular a Right Line, the very Shape of Contempt, through the midst of a People, - to create thus a Distinction betwixt 'em...\"When England colonised America, its proprietorial approach to the Earth (enclosure on the inside, exile on the outside) made a transition to its new colonies.Mason and Dixon embarked from a still quarrelsome Royal Society in London to solve a boundary dispute between two of the American colonies, by using their combined skills in astronomy and surveying.Their solution still stands, even though they developed it shortly before the American War of Independence.While it consisted of lines, barriers and separation, ironically their experience of America was quite the opposite.Infinite WildernessWhat they, and through them, Pynchon, admire about America is the fact that at the time it was a wilderness that offered infinite challenges and opportunities.Thus, at its heart, \"Mason & Dixon\" documents Pynchon's love affair with America. It's a Baroque hymn to the majesty and wonder of a native, unspoiled America.\"Gravity's Rainbow\" witnessed Americans discovering the Europe of World War II. In contrast, \"Mason & Dixon\" consists of two Englishmen exploring and mapping America.The story might be set in the past, but what Pynchon finds appealing is those parts of the past that are still reflected in the present. Thus, this is equally a love story about the America of the present, and the parts of it that have transitioned or survived from its past.Separated Not by a Line, but an AmpersandWhile there's a long list of characters, Pynchon primarily tells his tale through the eponymous Mason and Dixon (as witnessed and related by an \"untrustworthy Remembrancer [nevertheless possessed of] Authorial Authority\", the Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke). They commence as strangers, occasionally have their disagreements, maintain their distance (they \"could not cross the perilous Boundaries between themselves\", although at the end Mason & Dixon are separated only by an ampersand), become rather fond of each other in an English public school boy way, and end up resolving to become \"old Geezers\" together. When finally one is the first to die of old age, the other's son excuses his father's sentimental response:\"It's your Mate. It's what happens when your Mate dies.\"The Stars Are So CloseFor all their differences, Mason and Dixon are joined by their experience of the American wilderness. For them, it was an adventure, albeit one that took them away from their families for extended periods of time (as does reading the novel!).Nevertheless, their sense of wonder was infectious, and their children inherited it via their fathers' fantastic story-telling. In the end, it's their children who reiterate to them:\"The Stars are so close you won't need a Telescope. The Fish jump into your Arms. The Indians know Magick. We'll go there. We'll live there. We'll fish there. And you too.\"This is an America that above all inspires the imagination, it's a canvas upon which to paint a picture, a sheet of paper upon which not just to draw lines, but to write words and map out visions.Against the Great Wind of OblivionPynchon captures and verbalises these fantasies, so that they don't just die an ephemeral death:\"How much shapely Expression...is simply fading away upon the Air, out under the Door, into the Evening and the Silence beyond...Why not pluck a few words from the multitudes rushing toward the Void of forgetfulness? [Words which else would have been lost forever to the great Wind of Oblivion.]\"At the same time that the novel eulogises America, it suggests that there's something greater than one nation alone. \"Mason and Dixon\" is concerned with transition: the Transit of Venus, the transmission of values from one country to another, what occurs between two people(s), the last ferry ride across the River Styx:\"Betwixt themselves, neither feels British enough anymore, nor quite American, for either Side of the Ocean. They are content to reside like Ferrymen or Bridge-keepers, ever in a Ubiquity of Flow, before a ceaseless Spectacle of Transition.\"A Great Tangle of LinesThis is the dual significance of the lines that they draw: latitude and longitude represent a flow, a ch'i, an energy force. There is much wisequackery and semi-jocular allusion to ley-lines, meridians and feng-shui (not to mention talking dogs, flying pigs and mechanical ducks):\"Mason and Dixon step out of the Perimeter, into the Wild...lur'd by promises of forbidden Knowledge, in the Care of an inscrutable Druid...\"\"Earth, withal, is a Body, like our own, with its network of Points, dispos'd along its Meridians [much like the Human body, where the flow of Chee may be beneficially strengthen'd by insertions of Gold Needles]...\"There is also frequent intimation that Native Americans know something that the Europeans might never:\"What in the Holy Names are these people about?...Is it something in this Wilderness, something ancient, that waited for them, and infected their Souls when they came?\"We, on the other hand, might have lost touch with our past and our ancestors. We need to learn how to draw the line between them again, only a line that joins people rather than separating them:\"...there may ever continue more than one life-line back into a Past we risk, each day, losing our forebears in forever, - not a Chain of single Links, for one broken Link could lose us All, - rather, a great disorderly Tangle of Lines, long and short, weak and strong, vanishing into the Mnemonick Deep, with only their Destination in common.\"Fugitive as in a DreamFor Mason and Dixon, there are no grand egotistical dreams of wealth and fame (although you share their frustration at being locked out of membership of the Royal Society). Theirs is a much more modest manifestation of liberty:\"[We] wish'd but for a middling Life,Forever in betwixtThe claims of Lust and Duty,So intricately mix'd, -To reach some happy Medium,Fleet as a golden Beam,Uncharted as St Brendan's Isle,Fugitive as a Dream.\"Mason and Dixon are fugitives from arbitrary lines, boundaries, barriers, distinctions, divisions, divisiveness.Ultimately, this is why \"Mason & Dixon\" is not just a story about the 18th century, but an allegory for today.(view spoiler)[FRAGMENTS OF A LIBRETTO FOR AN OPERA BUFFAThe Transit of Venus[In the Words of Pynchon]Through our whole gazing-lives,Venus has been a tiny Dot of Light,Going through phases like the Moon,Ever against the black face of Eternity,But on the day of this Transit,All shall suddenly reverse -As she is caught, dark, embodied,Solid, against the face of the Sun -A Goddess descended from Light to Matter.Souvenirs of Skanderoon[After Pynchon]Hashish and Turkish delight,Minarets and palms at night,Muezzin's tunes and low divans,Crescent moons and caravans.The Hellfire Club[After Pynchon]Orange-girls and ale-pots,Beggars and buskers too,All gaming in the dirt,We'll one day come to rue Our object was to flirt.The girls laughed long atThe piquance of our mots,Still we lost slacks and shirt,Purses wafted away,While outside for a squirt.Adynaton Inspired by a Flying Pig[After and in the Words of Pynchon]Strangers, heed my wise advice,Never pay the retail price,Until pigs start an airlineCrewed by avionic swine.The Sound of Musick[In the Words of Pynchon]From behind the doors of Taverns,Came the cries of Sailors,And the jingling and Drone Of the Musick that pleases them.Lor-Love-a-Duck, It\u2019s the Missus!Let me tell you a Tale(Or is it a Canard?)Of Doctor Vaucanson'sRare, mechanickal duck:Its maker, no mere Quack,Devised for it Gratis(And for a Spectacle),Some fine Apparatus,Outrageously Life-Like,Rude and Erotickal.It didn't take long to Develop a Passion.Now he gets Up and On,Not just Down off his duck.Get My Continental Drift?Hey, diddle diddle,Oo-la-la, zoot cheroot And toot ma flute,A continental ladyMight be tres mignon orVery cute, but she'd stillBe a riddle to me.These Foolish Things (Remind Me of Rebekah)[In the Words of Pynchon]Moving water,The rock AbyssesAnd Mountainsides,Leaves in the windAnnouncing a Storm.Shadows of wrought IronworkUpon a wall,The kissing-crustsOf new-baked loaves.SOUNDTRACK:Mark Knopfler - \"Sailing To Philadelphia\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTvc-...Rob Scallon - \"Le Gentil & the Transit of Venus\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RvYX...Stunning bass playing!http://theconversation.com/transit-of...Richard Clapton - \"Suture Self\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLnhS...Howard Devoto - \"Rainy Season\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJVtp...The Stratford 4 - \"Rebecca\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_aY3...Bj\u00f6rk - \"Hyperballad\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0Pv-...\"In Iceland we don\u2019t go to church, we go for a walk and sing at the top of our lungs...\"There\u2019s a sacredness that comes with this landscape\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-ent...

Actually, I never could have imagined the novel as it actually exists. This is a combination of 18th century history, fantasy, a dollop of things magical and mysterious, a touch of poetry, astronomy and possibly astrology. Just about everything is present in this large novel. It's grand in all senses of the word.I will acknowledge that this may not be for every reader but those who like an epic, enjoy historical fiction with the add-ons I mention above will have a reading experience unlike any other. If you read through my status updates, you will get a flavor of the dialect used and some of the story.

What else is there to say. Well, I made the decision early on to read the book slowly and this worked well for me. Some sections read more quickly than others and I read this in company with other books. I came to look forward to returning to it and picking up Charles and Jeremiah's journeys to track the Transit of Venus, to perform various surveys, and then for their ultimate task, the line that is still marked and which I recall crossing on a trip several years ago.This is highly recommended to those who enjoy an epic with a very definite difference!"], ["Pynchon has been, for me, an acquired taste, but like fine wine, once you acquire it, you wonder how you missed the beauty for so long. Sure, there are still moments (mostly the jokey ones) that I find a bit flat, but here in Mason & Dixon, his first work after a long publishing hiatus, Pynchon is at his best. It's written in a made-up \"Olde Style\" of writing (it's impossible to do it justice in a review), but it actually works. At least it worked for me. I found the story utterly engrossing and a real intellectual joyride."], ["This is a magnificent novel, immense in its scope. It is not an easy read being set in the eighteenth century; Pynchon uses the language, idiom and spelling of the day. Hence very careful reading is required; it is more Fielding than Richardson. The story involves Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason (of Mason/Dixon line fame and follows them from England to South Africa (Transit of Venus) to St Helena, on to America to map the aforesaid line, back to Britain and so on. Pynchon mixes real historical figures with fantastic creations, oddities, rumour, and myth and in the centre of it all is the portrayal of a friendship in the form of a glorified road movie. The narrator is a Revd Wicks Cherrycoke, an offbeat and slightly disreputable clergyman. The choice of names is truly amazing (anyone met a Mrs Eggslap?).Historical figures slip in and out of the story; Boswell and Johnson towards the end, Washington (our heroes smoke pot with him), Jefferson, Maskelyne (Astronomer Royal and something of a villain), Franklin and Emerson, to name a few. The odd and fantastic populate the pages with some abandon. There is a museum devoted to the War of Jenkins Ear (1739, I remember this from A level history); complete with ear. A talking dog pops up on several occasions, as does a talking mechanical duck! The Lambton worm even makes an appearance.This is a people\u2019s history and Pynchon draws in all levels of society, including slaves and Native Americans, and all have a contribution. America seems full of Jesuits and the Chinese. There is much musing on religion, life after death (Mason sees the ghost of his wife), Feng Shui (I kid you not), lots of Astronomy (as you would imagine), suggestions of alien abduction, myth from a variety of cultures. The part concerning the giant vegetables reminded me of the Biblical story of the promised land flowing with milk and honey, where everything grew prolific(k)ally. Normal human activities also take their place; there is plenty of drinking, carousing, fighting, cooking, eating, sex, seduction and lots and lots of coffee.The language is stunning and the start of the book is beautiful \u201cSnowballs have flown their Arcs, starr\u2019d the Side of Outbuildings\u201d and so on. Some of the phrasing can be surprising and very clever, \u201cimps of apprehension\u201d. Pynchon asks lots of interesting philosophical questions; there is a passage about enlightenment and trees linking Adam and Eve, Buddha and Newton. A mere review cannot do this justice and eventually (probably when I retire) I will have to read it again.At heart it\u2019s a simple tale of two friends and the birth of a nation narrated by Cherrycoke (very American!) and laced with fantastical humour and philosophical musings"], ["Charles Mason (1728-1786) and Jeremiah Dixon (1733-1779) were British astronomers and surveyors, most famous for journeying to North America to resolve the boundary dispute between British colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Their work took four years - from 1763 to 1767 - and the result became known as the Mason-Dixon line, which today stands as the cultural boundary between the northern and southern American states. The duo inspired the reclusive Thomas Pynchon to write this novel, which in turn inspired Mark Knopfler to write one of hist best known songs, the beautiful Sailing to Philadelphia.To summarize this rolllicking and picaresque novel about two surveyors in pre-revolutionary America is a pointless task; unlike the Mason-Dixon line it is occupied with defying boundaries, and exploring contrasts. It is certainly a remarkable book, deserving attention for its prose alone: it is written entirely in a style which borrows works written in the 18th century, and yet remains uniquely its own; strange spelling variants and everpresent capitalization abound in its long and dense sentences, each meliticulously crafted with great attention - enormous effort went into writing this one, and it's difficult to resist mimicking it in personal correspondence. It's really a joy to read on textual level alone - to see the words, the way they're written and the sentences they form, and how the sentences combine to form a narrative.Although the novel begins with Mason's and Dixon's voyage to the Cape Colony in South Africa, where they observe the transfer of Venus - and in the meantime encounter a talking Norfolk terrier, who calls himself \"The Learned English Dog\" (and is a character whom I felt was grossly underused) and the Cape family of Vrooms, which seems to be composed entirely of nymphomaniacs - it is not until their arrival in colonial America where the reader is exposed to a galore of, well, everything. The novel itself is like a new and yet unexplored country: untamed and wild with danger, but rich with promise and opportunity. The reader becomes an explorer of this land: he has to create a map of a narrative to serve as a guide through the wilderness of ideas.Mason & Dixon explores dualism and dualities, and its ideas are like hot and cold currents. Each idea and theme is accompanied with an opposite, and the novel is focused on exploration of boundaries between them: how such boundaries come into being, how they are crossed and how the two different entities mix with one another, and how the boundaries which held them separate eventually disappear - and what is the result of all this. The still present elements of the mystic are contrasted with the age of reason and enlightement; melancholic and meditative Mason is contrasted with jovial and euphoric Dixon, and like Laurel and Hardy or Don Quixote and Sancho Pansa they venture to explore the weird frontier of America, where they meet a selection of historical characters, which at the time were not famous - but in history they will be: Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia, who enjoys being accompanied by women of suspicious reputation and entertains his guests with conversation; George Washington of Virginia, who is partial to smoking hemp and munching on cookies baked by his wife, Martha, and enjoys being entertained by Gershom, his wisecracking slave servant; Thomas Jefferson is in the right place to overhear Dixon's toast to the \"pursuit of happiness\", and ask if he might borrow it. The colonies are contrasted with a nation at the height of its imperial powers - growing differences in ways of thinking and hostility to the governing power will lead to a war, and eventually gain them independence. Jefferson, Washington and Franklin, among others, will form a nation of their own - one where all men are created equal, and can enjoy life, liberty and pursue their happiness, and view the destiny of their nation to spread these values beyond the thirteen colonies, from coast to coast. These noble ideas are in turn contrasted with reality and the way they're implemented - the effective theft of a continent from its native inhabitans - forced removals, killing and disregard for their life and happiness. How can it be the land of the free where all men are created equal, when its liberty and prosperity will be built with the hands of enslaved people, captured and brought there from another continent? The work of Mason and Dixon - the physical definition of boundaries in America - is at the same time an act of creation and division of the country; as the boundary between the frontier and civilization shrinks, one of the characters remarks that \"Nothing will produce Bad History more directly nor brutally, than drawing a line\". These words prove to be prophetic, as it the Mason-Dixon line will serve as a division between the North and South, and will split the infant nation in two and catapult it into the bloody civil war. The Mason-Dixon line can be seen as the symbolic line that started the uncountable dividing lines which put boundaries across America; the line of income inequality, of racial division and fear - turning the grand Cities into a dangerous frontier populated by various minorities, and forcing white settlers to flee to the safety of the suburbs.The unsung hero of this tale is the reverend Wicks Cherrycoke (Ha Ha! Get it?), who is the narrator of the novel and tells the story of Mason and Dixon to his family in Philadelphia, in 1786 - 21 years after they finished their line. The narration, too, is dualistic - the narrated events take place before the American Revolution, and there is an enormous sense of it brewing - but are narrated from a perspective of ten years after the event. The book both anticipates the Revolution - and contemplates upon it.Cherrycoke is a clergyman of questionable theology and a shameless moocher, sponging off his relatives who agreed to let him stay with them as long as he keeps their children entertained - if he won't perform then out with him to the streets ruled by harsh Philadelphia winter! Reverend Cherrycoke tells his tales to the twins, Pitt and Pliny - as it could not be agreed which one was born first, so each got a choice to be called \"Elder\" or \"Younger\" - who have heard him spin yarns about the faraway Indies and the faraway land of Hottentots, and request a tale about America. Cherrycoke claims to have met Mason and Dixon and accompanied them on a number of occasions, and tells the twins their story - which he liberally spices up with a heavy dose of invention, often describing events he couldn't have seen and people he has never met. Since his staying in the warm Philadelphia home depends completely on satisfaction of his listeners, Cherrycoke often changes his story according to their demands; jumping from one character to the other, using more action and fantastical elements to satisfy the boys - including a nod to the Canadian poet James McIntyre and a dramatization of his Ode on the Mammoth Cheese, stories of an amorous mechanical duck (which was based on a real invention - Jacques de Vaucanson's The enormous lenght and many, many tangents of Mason and Dixon might discourage many readers, it remains highly readable and will benefit from revisiting. Although the honor of being Thomas Pynchon's best book is commonly bestowed upon Gravity's Rainbow, I would argue that Mason & Dixon is an equal, if not better, candidate for the title. It's an ambitious epic which is a show of satire and farce and mixes the fantastic with the historic to great results, filled with countless puns and jokes, with characters randombly breaking into bawdy songs. With all that, it is also a work of melancholy: ruminations on the lost influence of mysticism and religion - and imagination as well. The loss of the final frontier and man's conquer of the beauty of wilderness and is subsequent replacement with contemporary civilization - endless streams of condos, parking lots and shopping malls. In a country found on unity and cooperation, Red and Blue powers take sway over land and people, each trying to grasp more than the other. But all this is seems like just a background to a simple story: one of two unlikely friends going on an adventure. The growing warmth between Mason and Dixon and the bond they form is presented with genuine affection and they become real, and so do their hopes, feelings and dreams, provoking genuine emotions. The final chapters, where we see them for one last time in their old age, are particularly touching.I don't think that any review could do this novel true justice: there are simply too many ideas, themes, gags and jokes that academic essays could be written on it - and were. As for me, I can only give 5 stars for the novel and 5 stars for the novelist who had the balls to write it, first thinking of it in 1975 and finally publishing it in 1997, when he turned 60. Approach without fear: there is much to be found and savored here, and time spent on reading it is definitely time not lost."], ["I am Jeremiah Dixon / I am a Geordie boy / A glass of wine with you, sir / And the ladies I'll enjoy / All Durham and Northumberland / Is measured up by my own hand / It was my fate from birth / To make my mark upon the earth.He calls me Charlie Mason / A stargazer am I / It seems that I was born to chart the evening sky / They'd cut me out for baking bread / But I had other dreams instead / This baker's boy from the west country / Would join the Royal Society.I was listening to one of my favourite albums of all time ( Sailing To Philadelphia ) when I got the idea that maybe I should read some more Pynchon. I read Inherent Vice some time ago and found it to be pretty fun. Having recently bought most of his books, I was wondering which one to read next. I wanted to (and still will) wait with Gravity's Rainbow, but the rest of his works were all interesting. Just as I was about to pick out Vineland, I hear the beautiful guitar picking of an F# chord from Mark Knopfler, an Aadd9 (or something like that) and then some sort of E-chord... and then the singing begins -- which is quoted at the top here. And that was that: Mason & Dixon it is! (After having read about 200 pages, I came across an interview with Knopfler where he talked about this album, and it turns out the song is in fact inspired by the book. For some reason this made me terribly happy...) The book itself is a tough nut to crack. It's written in the style of the time it's set it: 1761-1786. We follow the melancholic Mason and the life-loving Dixon as they meet up in Portsmouth, journey to see the transit of Venus, and then eventually go to America to draw their line. The book is chock-full of references and allusions -- there is even a reference to Bill Clinton's pot-smoking (but of course not inhaling!), a possible reference to Flowers for Algernon, and a cool little reference (I think) to Ray Charles's song What'd I say. Of course tons more. It's also filled with odd and often hilarious occurrences. They meet up and smoke marijuana with George Washington; they meet a skirt-chasing Benjamin Franklin; and they meet a talking dog called the Learned English Dog. And then there is some talk of gigantic vegetables and possible giants...? I think. I'm not sure. Oh, and did I mention the mechanical duck that suddenly springs to life and apparently gets supernatural powers and then occasionally terrorises our two heroes? The book is described on the cover as a \"rollicking picaresque tale... playful, erudite and funny.\" I think that's a pretty succinct way to describe it. It's fun to read, albeit challenging and awfully dense at times. I also came across this on wikipedia, and thought I could add it to my review:\"John Krewson, writing for The Onion's A. V. Club observed, \"Whatever meanings and complex messages may lie hidden in Pynchon's text can, for now, be left to develop subconsciously as the reader enjoys the more immediate rewards of the work of a consummate storyteller. Pynchon is one, and he never quite lets you forget that while this might be an epic story, it's an epic story told to wide-eyed children who are up past their bedtime.\"PS: You can hear the song I referred to in the beginning here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrLdK...PPS, 03.07.2015:It's been over a year since I read this, and I don't think there are any other books out there that I think of with such fond memories as I do of this one. Retrospectively, I'm tempted to say that this is my all-time favourite book -- trumping even The Brothers Karamazov. The more I think about this book, the more I love it. It helps, of course, that I still love the Knopfler song, and listen to it several times a week. At every listen, it evokes the same feelings as the book did. It's amazing when works of art go hand in hand like that."], ["This was my favourite Pynchon novel. I know most folks will say that Gravity's Rainbow or the more accessible The Crying of Lot 49 were his great works, but I felt that M&D just was such a beautiful story. The coming together of these two most opposite personalities and their adventures across the native forests and rivers and wildernesses that because what we now know as America was compelling and fascinating. I was not bored for a minute but rather was entertained and felt buoyed by the 17th/18th English syntax - it helped me escape and feel I was watching the story as an omniscient observer. In terms of narrative, it is one of the most straightforward of Pynchon's works (and believe me, that is saying something for one of this length!), and has a great host of characters and high-flying adventures of all sorts. Perhaps, if you have never read Pynchon, this one may be too big a chunk to chew on for the first time (perhaps Lot 49 would be more appropriate), but once you have that one and or GR under your belt, don't deprive yourself of the joy of reading Mason&Dixon."], ["Video-review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxFK...Featured in my Top 20 Books I Read in 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X6OQ...Pynchon's most ambitious novel might very well be his masterpiece - a flawless pastiche of 18th Century language, compelling characters, wondrous adventures and brainy reflections, everything soaked in Pynchon's trademark mixture of high&low, serious&ridiculous, bitterness&hope.

I already conduct too much free labor for this corporatized library as is.More than half of the states composing the US owe their linguistic sustainability to the indigenous people, metaphorical roots which do little to combat sequestering in reservations and genocide everywhere else. It's not the only reason why I still get friend requests from people with whom a share nearly 300 works, of which a mere three are by women of color, but the situations run on the same fuel. Within the already sunken realm of writings by women of color there is still yet further stratification, and I will admit to having fallen into their trap while devoting two thirds of 2016's reading to this oft neglected but still hierarchical demographic.

Paul Auster is the master mind messer. This book is an MC Escher drawing in literary form. *Spoiler alert*Mr Blank is in a room. He can't remember who he is, anything about his past or where he came from. All he knows is what people tell him about himself and without knowing it he is under 24 hour scrutiny by a higher power, someone with an overall view of the situation. Characters enter the room, perform basic tasks and leave and almost the instant that they are gone Mr Blank forgets who they are. So who is Mr Blank? Well Blank is Auster and Auster has taken the opportunity to anonymously write himself and all the great characters from all his earlier novels (Peter Stillman, Walt Rawley, Daniel Quinn, Fanshawe) into this book. The empty room is Austers own imagination. An effective prison to Mr Blank because he can try to walk out at any time but he is paralysed within the limits of his own mind. No matter where he goes he will always be trapped inside his own head. The cast of characters, who outwardly appear benign are the characters that Auster gave life to in all those novels. At the end of novel he is charged with cruelty, criminal indifference, sexual molestation and negligent homicide - these are all the things he subjected his characters to when he made them experience a life of his choosing and now they are back to get him. Mr Blank is about to learn that you can create a fantasy cast of people and send them out into the world but once they're out there they will keep on living and the tables are about to be turned as the author becomes the subject of a story over which he has no control in an environment not of his own making. He cannot even remember who he is and that is because he has no substance, he is being written into existance as the story progresses.This book is probably a clever comment on what it means to be a writer - you can get caught up in your own head and in your own stories. You can come to believe that the people you create are close friends because you know them so well. Labels can be applied to anything and what you apply them to does not have to be constant or remain the same. Or it might be a comment on nothing.. who knows? But I enjoyed reading it and I was extremely pleased when I recognised all the characters names although if you've never read any other Auster novels then this is not the place to start.

To sum it up, it's all these characters from Auster's other books seeking revenge on this person who sent them on their \"missions\"--Auster himself, I suppose. It's his characters putting him through one of his stories, locking him in a mysterious room and taking away his memories so he's in one of his own puzzles. How droll! If you haven't read his other books, it might be interesting--might, I don't know. Having read them I found myself learning nothing new about the other characters and reading a story that fails to stand on its own merits.What I find most disappointing about it is the clumsiness of all the characters being in one spot. One of his neat little tricks in his works is to have a character from another book sort of whizz by in whatever you're reading, and you are sitting there wondering whether this happened before, or what, whether Quinn or Stillman or whomever has gone nuts yet, or is going to. But Travels takes it to this absurd length where it ceases to have any impact and instead reads like a list of characters and some ham-fisted attempt to shoehorn them into a plotless story. If you like Auster, don't read this, just ignore it and enjoy the obvious genius in his other books. Reading this is like seeing your grandfather naked--just disappointing and upsetting, and sad."], ["\u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0636\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a

Mai incontrato titolo pi\u00f9 enigmatico.Da tempo \u00e8 previsto un adattamento cinematografico di questo magnifico romanzo, avrebbe gi\u00e0 dovuto essere completato, e invece se ne sono perse le tracce. Qui, l\u2019attore-regista Campbell Scott, incaricato della regia e del ruolo del marito di Charlotte.Mi ha colpito la sensazione che in questo racconto di una donna narrato da un\u2019altra donna, Didion sappia esattamente cosa scrivere, non perda tempo, ma sappia sfruttare quello a sua disposizione, senza eccesso, n\u00e9 di risparmio n\u00e9 di prodigalit\u00e0.Didion trattiene l\u2019emozione, anche se il melodramma \u00e8 alla base del mondo che descrive: si adopra per risparmiare parole e scegliere quelle sottotono facendo ampio ricorso all\u2019ironia. Sa rimanere distaccata mentre penetra a fondo. Eppure l\u2019emozione mi arriva, in certi momenti perfino struggente.Ghiaccio bollente, \u00e8 la sintesi che mi viene alla mente per descrivere questa sensazione.Due donne protagoniste, molto diverse.La narratrice, prossima alla morte per malattia, che sembra saperla lunga, sul mondo la vita e la gente, ma non \u00e8 mai saccente, mai un passo avanti agli altri: anzi, sembra preferire restare un passo indietro, per poter studiare meglio il proprio interlocutore - privilegia ascoltare piuttosto che spargere il sale della sua esperienza. \u00c8 di rara onniscienza riguardo ai fatti che coinvolgono la protagonista, la fica norteamericana.Christina Hendricks che dovrebbe interpretare Charlotte.E Charlotte, intorno alla quale ruota la storia del romanzo \u2013 Charlotte cos\u00ec ingenua da credere che geografia e storia universali siano ricalcate sulla California e gli US in genere. Ma anche nella sua ignoranza, Charlotte \u00e8 innocente, quasi vittima. \u00c8 una preda, circondata da mariti che non brillano per empatia e comprensione, \u00e8 una madre respinta dalla figlia cui forse ha sottratto attenzione una volta di troppo. Una figlia alla quale non ha saputo spiegare il mondo perch\u00e9 neppure lei madre lo ha capito. La morte la coglier\u00e0 per caso, come per caso le \u00e8 capitata tutta la vita.Chi non ha pi\u00f9 nulla di innocente, chi ha perso completamente ogni traccia d\u2019innocenza \u00e8 il mondo: nello specifico, il continente americano, il mondo nuovo.\u00c8 successo gi\u00e0 tutto: l\u2019assassinio di JFK e poi di suo fratello Bob, di Malcom X e Martin Luther King \u2013 il Vietnam \u00e8 un carnaio senza uscita \u2013 Charles Manson \u2013 i figlio dei fiori si sono trasformati in ben altro \u2013 l\u2019esercito di Liberazione Simbionese ha gi\u00e0 rapito e cooptato Patricia Hearst (Marin, la figlia terrorista di Charlotte?) \u2013 l\u201911 settembre, il primo 11 settembre, il golpe cileno \u2013 e mentre Didion scriveva e stava per pubblicare, la guerra sporca argentina inventava i voli della morte e moltiplicava i desaparecidos\u2026Allison Janney che dovrebbe interpretare Grace, la narratrice.Didion mi ha riportato con forza agli anni Settanta.Come leggere un libro di Vidal. Come vedere quei film surreali dai dialoghi assurdi scritti da Jules Feiffer dove le star erano Elliott Gould, Alan Arkin, Donald Sutherland\u2026Joan Didion \u00e8 stata una sorpresa che non mi aspettavo, e ancora faccio fatica a chiarire la mia reazione, il mio pensiero. Si dice che le cose migliori scritte da Didion siano di non-fiction, prima di tutto di giornalismo. Io ho cominciato assaggiando proprio la fiction: vuol dire che mi aspettano tante altre belle scoperte.Joan Didion, che sarebbe stata la migliore Grace immaginabile."], ["Didion is one of those rare authors that pens hypnotic sentences that weave into paragraphs that make you struggle to recall where you are and why there's drool on your chin. It doesn't matter if she's writing about a fictional banana republic or a non-fictional bout of depression from having outlived her husband and daughter, JD writes sentences that I want to climb into like a warm bed. Ones like this:\nAs a child of the western United States she had been provided as well with faith in the value of certain frontiers on which her family had lived, in the virtues of cleared and irrigated land, of high-yield crops, of thrift, industry and the judicial system, of progress and education, and in the generally upward spiral of history.\nThere's a lot of dialogue in this book - more than I can recall in other Didion works - but it's wonderful, like something ripped from the second act of a Wilde play. Our narrator is telling us the story of Charlotte, Warren and Leonard - a love triangle that traps the worst human detritus in those three acute angles - all the while peppering the narrative with her own story in the fictional country of Boca Grande. This is a great place for Didion initiates to begin, a tremendous novel that packs so much into its small amount of pages."], ["Read this for the superbly nasty Warren Bogart, a villain righteous in his contempt, critically intricate in his abuse, and for that worthy of the narrator's single sympathetic glance his way. Charlotte Douglas, his ex-wife, is the kind of female character Didion is known for: numb, baffled, drifting in and out. I don't find characters like Charlotte very interesting, but Didion does milk a kind of poetry from their stunting and disappointment, their air of unfulfillment; and Didion's portraits have at least a documentary value, as we're littered with Charlottes, women who had an illusion of an idea of themselves at, say, age 19, but who soon hit a rock, and in the subsequent years allow their spouses and lovers to talk over them, talk for them, while she warbles ineffectually over the souvenirs of youth."], ["Alla fine del primo capitolo ero perplessa. Dopo il secondo irritata. Allora ho cercato di contestualizzarlo. Prima edizione negli Stati Uniti nel lontano 1977. Certo, come ha detto qualcuno, il continente americano aveva perso la propria innocenza allora, e quindi, una scrittrice che riesca a dire quello che gli americani combinano in quello che considerano il loro \u201corto\u201d, il continente sudamericano, (e non solo) dopo gli assassinii eccellenti nel loro meraviglioso Paese, non \u00e8 impresa da poco. E probabilmente il caso di Patricia Hearst, ereditiera che dopo essere stata rapita da un gruppo di terroristi si unisce a loro rapinando banche e uccidendo, ha ispirato pi\u00f9 scrittori negli U.S.A, come qui per la figlia della protagonista.Buona l\u2019idea della voce narrante, una donna, che, pur invischiata nel potere, sta morendo di cancro.Ma ho dovuto arrivare al decimo capitolo per cominciare a provare piacere in quello che leggevo. Sicuramente belle quelle descrizioni ironiche di come guerriglieros e potere si comportano durante un colpo di stato, chiaramente ben orchestrato da chi ha loro procurato armi e quant\u2019altro.Non mi lamento quindi del soggetto o della trama, bens\u00ec, e qui si entra nel gusto personale, bens\u00ec dello stile della Didion.Lo chiamano minimalista. Tutti quei periodi di due o tre parole al massimo.Con un ritmo sincopatoE sempre a capo.Che una frase con due verbi perammordiddio e una congiunzione non si pu\u00f2.Un misto tra una telescrivente e un monologo di Adriano Celentano.Questione di gusti, ripeto, quindi niente contro la Didion, amici, non vi scandalizzate.Ma amo stili differenti e con questo faccio fatica.Mi dicono che L\u2019anno del pensiero magico sia magnifico.Spero per\u00f2 che il suo stile a quel punto sia cambiato."], ["This starts out feeling like one of those Deborah Eisenberg stories set in a made-up Central American country, but pretty soon you orient yourself and realize you're in deliciously dated late-1970s Didionland. This entails being surrounded by characters who think, speak, and behave only like Joan Didion characters and not remotely like anyone in actual life, and reading gorgeously crafted and sometimes embarrassingly dramatic sentences. The novel is narrated by steely, Didionesque observer Grace, and tells the story of Charlotte Douglas, the wealthy, childlike, hypersensual, idiosyncratic mother of a Patty Hearst-type rich-girl-turned-revolutionary-terrorist. Charlotte is hanging around Boca Grande, a fake maybe-El Salvador where she has fled to escape her Joan Didion novel of a past and to submit the enigma of her existence to the former-anthropologist-cum-hobby-scientist-and-ruling-elite narrator's gaze.I personally feel sentimental about the Bay Area in the 1970s, as it's the ground out of which I was grown, and this book fed my hunger for a glimpse of that time. This is actually just the second Didion novel I've read, but she has such a distinctive style that I keep wanting to make broad pronouncements about her fiction. There is almost no one I take more seriously than Joan Didion the nonfiction writer, but I find her fiction pretty absurd. I happen to love it, but it strikes me at many times as coming close to camp. Everyone is so rich and disoriented and the sex is all weird and women are these confused, fascinating creatures who are sort of hapless victims of often cruel, or at least detached men who have great success both in understanding and controlling the female characters and in navigating the world. I'm not sure what to make of it all, but I do like it. This book is fun and, as I said, very late-1970s. I read it on an airplane, in a hotel, and at my in-laws' house, and it's good for that kind of vacation. Definitely recommend this paperback edition with the lighter on the front and the lady's face and Cosmo blurb on the back."], ["As I had recently read The Last Love Song: A Biography of Joan Didion, I decided I' wanted to read some of Joan Didion's novels. This is the first one I read.It's mainly set somewhere in Central America, about an American woman who is living there, for reasons which are never really fully explained, and narrated by another woman who owns almost the whole place.It's really kind of a strange novel, without much in the way of a discernible plot, and the dialogue is really weird, with most of it not being anything anyone would actually say in real life. I thought it was an ok book, but didn't really love it or anything like that."], ["Maybe there is no motive role in this narrative.Maybe it is just something that happened.Then why is it in my mind when nothing else is.IN SUMMARY the above quote explains the entire novel. Of course \u201cnovel\u201d is a loaded word when it comes to Didion; her journalistic essays and her fiction-prose always blur, which makes for awesome journalism and perplexing prose. I am perplexed as to why this novel exists. When I was finished with it \u2013 and I was glad that I was; too much time spent in such a stifling environment and it starts to rub off \u2013 I believe I wasn\u2019t the only one perplexed. Didion was too.What are we to make of Charlotte Douglas? Her grandiose vapidity is an easy target for social satire, but so is Hollywood, and LA culture, and third-world puppet regimes, and so is blatant, punishing misogyny. It might be just simple satire if the character of Charlotte wasn\u2019t a distinct authorial stand-in for Didion herself. Which is perplexing. There is a current of masochism that runs straight from the depressing cesspool of Play It As It Lays right into this book, like Didion is trying to punish her younger self for being so stupid, like she wants to emphasize the criminally and damnably misogynistic former husbands to emphasize just how na\u00efve and vain she felt she once was. This is uncomfortable, especially since it precludes said criminal misogy-dooshes from ever getting their comeuppance. What is comeuppance for someone that feels no empathy? Revenge against this kind of scum would be for them to finally feel for themselves what it feels like to treat someone so terribly; but if one feels no empathy then they are incapable of seeing how it feels. Every character in this novel, bar maybe the prime narrator (another Didion stand-in), seems like any reprimand would only be rationalized away, like a child getting spanked for doing something wrong and never making the connection between the wrong action and the physical pain of the spank.After reading the synopsis I thought this would be a novel companion to Salvador, Didion\u2019s excellent collection of journalistic essays on her time in Central America during the 80s, which for Central and Latin America, was a very black decade (re:genocide). This isn\u2019t a companion to Salvador though, it is a companion to Slouching Towards Bethlehem, primarily for its key theme of the harmful effects that come from an inability to describe one\u2019s own thoughts. Without the words, without the education in whatever form, to describe how one feels, one is vulnerable to every kind of atrocity. Not everyone that lacks this ability is stupid, just as not everyone that can\u2019t read is stupid; they\u2019ve just learned to deal with it, and after a certain point, it becomes easier to avoid than to apprehend. Meanwhile, the atrocities pile up. Oh, but don\u2019t worry: Even if you\u2019re smart enough to understand yourself or your feelings or ascertain the contradictions of both, you won\u2019t really be any better off. Things won\u2019t make any more sense. What really happened and what you remember will be impossible to determine. It wouldn\u2019t matter anyway."], ["Several times during Joan Didion's Book of Common Prayer, one character will tell another that they \"were wrong.\" In what almost seems irrelevant. Causes, love, politics, are all compromised. Wrongness is an empty term hardly worth the air it takes to utter the word. Nearly everyone is on the make. Lawyers can champion radical movements one day, hobnob with the beautiful people that night, and fly to Miami the next in order to seal a deal for Mirage jets. Air head college students join revolutionary movements and become air headed revolutionaries. Government bureaucrats (especially the ones overseas) are probably CIA. Didion's take on the 70s is razor sharp, and told through the forensic voice of Grace Strasser-Mendana, a rich and dying widow, who becomes fascinated with the personality and predictable fate of the neurotic bundle of nerves named Charlotte Douglas. Charlotte is both fleeing herself and searching for her Weatherman-like daughter. Boca Grande, an unstable Central American country, is as good a place as any for the unruly daughter to show up, or a grave to embrace you. For a slim book, Didion packs a lot of story, perhaps too much, as she spends, arguably, too much time on Charlotte's first husband, Warren Bogart, an epic, poetry quoting asshole. Warren is one of the most abusive characters I've run across in all of literature (and I've read a lot). Didion knows this as well, and lingers a bit too long. But when the Didion (via Grace) put down comes, it goes to the bone -- and beyond. In a way I suppose it's worth it since Warren finally shuts his mouth. As I said, it's the 70s. Booze, drugs, threesomes in bed, machine guns, dinner parties, and cholera epidemics. Didion covers it all, and does so with admirable economy. I saw where some reviewers compared \"Common Prayer\" to Roth's American Pastoral. Well, in a way (daughters gone bad) it does, but for my money, Didion is much closer to the ground in capturing what the 70s were like. If you are a fan of Conrad's Nostromo, or Robert Stone's Flag for Sunrise, Didion's brutal examination of things American and Central American is a must read."], ["Charlotte Douglas, in transito.La bella e misteriosa Charlotte, la fica norteamericana, come la chiamer\u00e0 con disprezzo uno dei padroni del luogo, arriva a Boca Grande, la citt\u00e0 in cui la luce \u00e8 abbagliante e seducente, senza un perch\u00e9, in fuga dalla vita, ma molto pi\u00f9 probabilmente in transito, com'\u00e8 sempre stata in ogni luogo ove abbia messo radici.

Avrebbe potuto farlo.Avrebbe dovuto farlo per tutta la vita.Tutto quello che so ora \u00e8 che quando penso a Charlotte Douglas che cammina nel caldo vento notturno in direzione delle luci di Capilla del Mar, sono sempre meno certa che questa sia stata una storia di illusioni.A meno che le illusioni non fossero le mie.[\u2026] Non sono stata la testimone che avrei voluto essere."], ["Like Play It As It Lays, this is a supremely disillusioned novel -- in people, in politics -- but the theater across which it plays out is sprawling and unique, from the pitch black personal-destructive recesses of the deep south to the revolutionary conflagrations of a small South American dictatorship. Ostensibly the story is Charlotte's, a complexly-shaded women adrift in her life until she washes up in Boca Grande, but equally fascinating, and obsessively observed, is our narrator, Grace, an anthropologist and semi-disinterested political manipulator who takes it upon herself to relate the events of the novel, despite or because her own not so incidental involvement in them. Throughout, the rhythms and cadences of Didion's words, and the cultural-psychological weight behind her repetitions and reconfigurations, maintains a tightly controlled performance. It takes a little while to see how the part could possibly all be in communication with eachother, but they are, with precision and coldly boiling insight."]], "review_count": "224", "description": "Writing with the telegraphic swiftness and microscopic sensitivity that have made her one of our most distinguished journalists, Joan Didion creates a shimmering novel of innocence and evil.<b>A Book of Common Prayer</b> is the story of two American women in the derelict Central American nation of Boca Grande.

That is probably for the best, though. I already conduct too much free labor for this corporatized library as is.More than half of the states composing the US owe their linguistic sustainability to the indigenous people, metaphorical roots which do little to combat sequestering in reservations and genocide everywhere else. It's not the only reason why I still get friend requests from people with whom a share nearly 300 works, of which a mere three are by women of color, but the situations run on the same fuel. Within the already sunken realm of writings by women of color there is still yet further stratification, and I will admit to having fallen into their trap while devoting two thirds of 2016's reading to this oft neglected but still hierarchical demographic.

I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again. 'In three variants on the classic detective story, Paul Auster makes the well-traversed terrain of New York city his own, as it becomes a strange, compelling landscape in which identities merge or fade and questions serve only to further obscure the truth.'I stayed on in the house for a few more days. My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place. Fanshawe was there, and no matter how hard I tried not to think of him, I couldn't escape. This was unexpected, galling. Now that I had stopped looking for him, he was more present to me than ever before. The whole process had been reversed.

It's a mystery. Libra is entirely great. Its vocals, its backing, the bass, the drums, man alive the drums, the harmonies - celestial, Wilsonian is the only word. And - of course - the lyrics. As we know it's about that JFK thing. The whole thing, all of it. So yes, this is the ur-conspiracy we are dealing with, which all the other conspiracies use as the template. Given my well-advertised detestation of all things conspiracytheoretical, you might think I would want to give Libra the widest of berths. Being a contrarian means I couldn't. I take contrary opinions to myself too. I had to pay my dues. I had to stare the god damned conspiracy in its jowles, I had to rummage in its belly and pick over what it ate last night, ugh, all its grimy details, its filthy postulates and its mind-damaging Agatha-Christie's-Murder-on-the-Orient-Express conclusion that - gasp, look away now - they ALL did it!So I looked and stared and rummaged and poked and turned affadavits over in my hand and ran the tape found in the camera up Marilyn Monroe's backside, all of that.

Through all the slow-as-the-Devonian-Age build up to even the first faint gleamings of the plot to kill John Kennedy your brain gets reformed, your aesthetic sense gets taken down and reworked with minor chords replacing all the major ones, its like a dream but a weird lovely one, one of those thousand year long dreams you wake from on some Sundays when the world can take long minutes to suck back into place... how long have I been away? Whose face is on my own head now? It takes so long to read Libra, it's such a slog through all this stuff which might have gone down like that or might on the other hand, or not, or partly.What DD does in his gradually accelerating sarabande is to take the absolute standard CIA/Mafia/Teamsters/FBI/Cubans conspiracy and weave all the ghosts and spirits together, voices humming like a hive, all the five hundred characters, into a symphony of incidence and co-incidence wittingly but at the same time blindly moving like a giant shoal of fate towards the moving target in the limousine in Dallas on the day that Deep Purple by Nino Tempo and April Stevens was number one on the Billboard charts.This is a fantastic novel. The imposter \"Don DeLillo\" could never have written it."], ["Libra es donde convergen todas las teor\u00edas conspirativas que han ido surgiendo con el correr de los a\u00f1os, a partir del famoso 22 de noviembre del 1963, una fecha que, en palabras de DeLillo, quebr\u00f3 la columna vertebral del siglo en Estados Unidos. En Libra DeLillo propone que el asesino \u00aboficial\u00bb del presidente Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, solo fue la cara visible de una conspiraci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s grande y enrevesada, fundada desde el mismo coraz\u00f3n de los EE. UU., a partir de una decisi\u00f3n que muchos consideran un error de Kennedy, durante una invasi\u00f3n a Cuba (en la operaci\u00f3n conocida como Bay of Pigs del 61) para derrocar a Fidel Castro. Por supuesto que Libra no necesariamente condice con lo que realmente piensa DeLillo (al menos no con exactitud), incluso ya lo ha hecho expl\u00edcito en varias ocasiones, pero siempre es interesante llegar con literatura a lugares imposibles de la vida real.Leyendo rese\u00f1as de otros usuarios, me encontr\u00e9 con personas a las que les pas\u00f3 lo mismo que a m\u00ed: este DeLillo de Libra no es el mismo que el DeLillo de, por ejemplo, White Noise. DeLillo es intensamente criticado por su modo de escribir, sus tramas insulsas y sus personajes planos y de cart\u00f3n; sin embargo, en Libra queda claro que DeLillo es un grand\u00edsimo escritor, y no solo su modo de narrar es extraordinario, sino que es un escritor que se adapta. En White Noise, DeLillo utiliz\u00f3 una narraci\u00f3n muy vac\u00eda y sin mucho cuerpo precisamente porque a aquello iba su libro, a criticar la deshumanizaci\u00f3n de la sociedad debido al consumismo desalmado. En Libra, la escritura de DeLillo adquiere un tono mucho m\u00e1s fragmentado, hasta asfixiante. En casi ning\u00fan momento el lector tiene plena constancia de lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo y de qui\u00e9n es cada personaje, como Nicholas Branch, entre datos solitarios que se juntan en coincidencias incognoscibles que alimentan la paranoia. Y para volver m\u00e1s desesperantes las cosas, quiebra la narraci\u00f3n con frases que parecen salidas de la nada y aun as\u00ed, de alguna forma, se sienten en armon\u00eda con lo que estabas leyendo. DeLillo juega con cambios de tiempo aleatorios y sin previo aviso, di\u00e1logos entre personajes que le hablan al aire, dentro de un soliloquio cortado por otras voces en el fondo y a las que tambi\u00e9n se debe escuchar, y todo este caos crea un clima que absorbe al lector en la misma conspiraci\u00f3n. Pero principalmente quiero resaltar el aspecto que, en mi opini\u00f3n, es el m\u00e1s valioso de Libra. DeLillo ha sabido establecer personajes tan complejos y tan bien desplegados que hasta asustan de su tridimensionalidad. DeLillo bebi\u00f3 de personas reales y las represent\u00f3 en papel sin casi perder su condici\u00f3n de reales. Se apoder\u00f3 de Lee Oswald y lo encaj\u00f3 en literatura, en un Coming of Age tr\u00e1gico y plagado de malas influencias que hace que se llegue a sentir una clase de apego por Oswald, quiz\u00e1 l\u00e1stima. Porque a eso va DeLillo, la verdadera historia se desarrolla detr\u00e1s del tel\u00f3n. Personas como ara\u00f1as en la oscuridad susurr\u00e1ndose entre s\u00ed son las que marcan el inicio de un tiempo y cierran otro. \u00abLa historia se compone de la suma de los elementos que no nos cuentan\u00bb. DeLillo nos explica que la historia se gesta a nuestras espaldas y lo que vemos es solo un breve fragmento perdido del que se agarran los medios y la histeria social para explicar hechos de lo que nunca lograremos saber su verdad. Probablemente jam\u00e1s se forme una segunda Comisi\u00f3n Warren que explique lo que la primera todav\u00eda no puede explicar, seguiremos de este lado de la historia, del lado de la luz, viendo ef\u00edmeras chispas que se escapan de lo que se nos est\u00e1 prohibido observar. Porque as\u00ed debe ser y aqu\u00ed nos ha tocado estar.\u00abCuando est\u00e1s convencido de que has visto todas las formas en que la violencia puede sorprenderte, aparece algo nuevo que ni siquiera hab\u00edas imaginado. \u00bfCon cu\u00e1nta fuerza golpean las balas para alcanzar a un hombre en el pecho y hacer que su sombrero vuele un metro y medio por los aires en l\u00ednea recta? Fue una lecci\u00f3n sobre las leyes del movimiento y un recordatorio para la humanidad entera de que nada es seguro\u00bb."], ["This book of DeLillo was a brilliant dive into the background of Kennedy's presumed assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald (with a cameo of his killer Jack Ruby). It is well-written and well-paced and a great read. I would put it on the level with Mao II and White Noise but below Underworld. So an essential DeLillo as long as you have UW under your belt already."], ["a work of bright and ruthless genius, the jfk assassination as recounted by some alien being from the far future. well actually, not really, not at all. well actually, at times it felt like it. is delillo less than human or more than human? the novel makes no attempt to be historically factual. actually, the facts presented are reasonable and sound. the novel is historically factual, as much as anything can be. the narrative is, of course, almost too complex to be detailed. although it is, in its way, a straightforward narrative, straight as an arrow, straight as any history of well-known events could be. conspiracy theories, so many of them, competing with each other, often making complete sense as they are told, only to be collapsed by the next conspiracy theory. the conspiracy theory as just one version of the many-told tale, stories handed down from teller to teller. an interesting conceit. actually, more than that - storytelling is perhaps the point of the whole novel. what is the truth in a story? who is the real person behind the historical personage, behind the character in the story? the novel wonders: can reality ever truly be represented? such a humorous book at times. the jokes are secret jokes, told with a straight face. the deaths are no joke, no joke at all. the novel is dead serious. the death of lee harvey oswald is a harrowing, moving experience, the best sequence of many excellent sequences in the book. the novel is powerful and yet filled with minutiae, with meaningless detail. each detail is packed with meaning. it is a Choose Your Own Adventure, of sorts. astrology is real, it defines us and all of our actions. astrology is an illusion, as is motivation and circumstance and conspiracy and history itself. Libra is a post-modern classic. well, actually"], ["One can read  Libra  as a political thriller or a voice in the discussion about who actually stood behind one of the most notorious political assassinations of the twentieth century. Shots in Dallas proved that this an event can not be easily interpreted, it melts in the mist of conjectures and hypotheses and still is a breeding ground for more and more daring conspiracy theories. (I\u2019m not a huge fan of conspiracy theories, neither in books nor in real life. In fact we, in Poland, have enough these ones. People are divided on those who think that Smolensk was tragic plane accident and others who belive that it was a criminal assassination. Sorry for this personal comment). Libra  operates on three plans. The first one it is a story of Lee H. Oswald shown from his childhood in the Bronx, through his service in Japan, his romance with Marxism and stay in the Soviet Union until his death from Jack Ruby\u2019s hand. Oswald is the title \"Libra\", the man full of contradictions, like the zodiacal sign of Libra, you really don\u2019t know what could tip the scales on one or other side. From DeLillo's writing emerges portrait of a man without qualities, somewhat mysterious yet undecidable character - we fail to know what exactly his motivation was.On the second plan we get the conspiratorial activities of the special services and the criminal groups. Here the main roles play retired agents, members of the anti-Castro opposition, anti-communist activists, mafia. Independently of each other are preparing a provocation aimed at Kennedy. And finally, the third thread, which takes place many years after the assassination of Kennedy. The main protagonist here is a CIA analyst buried by Agency with meticulous facts and factual evidence, trying to order them and get to know what really happened in Dallas. Yes, the same DeLillo is doing.Like every tragic and unsolved mystery Kennedy\u2019s assassination became a source of a variety theories trying to get a logical explanation. The picture that DeLillo creates is so unsettling and thought-provoking, and the whole story so coherent and plausible that when we finish our reading, our thinking is and what if that was like that \u2026 ."], ["DeLillo and I are friends now!!We had started off on the wrong foot, but Libra has patched things up. I too share Paul's suspicions about Libra and White Noise having been written by the same person. Had I been handed these two books without the cover, I wouldn't have known those words had flown out of the same figurative pen.Libra is a terrific piece of work. It has a huge cast of characters and a very complex web of events, all handled neatly and elegantly. While DeLillo's characters never really open up to the readers, they can still be haunting and memorable. The writing is very dense and can have a lot of sub-textual meaning. Instead of directly telling the readers what the mood of a scene is or how a character feels, he creates the atmosphere with his words and conveys the feeling quite effectively. Among other things, I liked the way he would give one the sense of slowly or rapidly passing time without saying as much (I have lost my copy, otherwise I could have pulled out a few quotes to show you what I mean. Oh well.) Oswald's mother's neurotic behavior, his wife Marina's feelings of helplessness, dilemmas of many characters are portrayed so well that even minor characters carve a niche for themselves and stay with the reader.Unlike typical thrillers where characters are mere caricatures blindly running after power/money ***, DeLillo's characters are quite real. They do stop long enough to breathe and think. The reader is privy to their objectives, their motivations, their hesitations and dilemmas. Despite knowing how the story is going to end, it is never uninteresting.For me, the most outstanding part of Libra is the realization of the character Lee Harvey Oswald. He is terrifyingly real and complex. He doesn't conform to either hero or anti-hero stencil. I neither like him nor dislike him, but I feel great sympathy for him. His whole life seems to be something of an accident (I mean more accidental than most lives are). It is as if one day he closed his eyes, spun around and then started walking in the direction that he had ended up facing. As a very young teenager, Marxism and communism caught his fancy, without anyone directing him that way. And this very passion acted as his guiding light. What if something else had caught his eye at that stage? He would have been an altogether different person. Though his behavior is far from ideal, he has so many great qualities that could have led him to an exemplary life. He is man of great commitment. He stands by what he believes in and would go to any lengths to support his beliefs. How painstakingly he kept at writing and reading despite his dyslexia is mentioned often in the book. If only....Like Lee's life, the theme of accidental happenings is something DeLillo highlights too. Agent branch trying to solve the confusing maze of the events leading upto JFK assassination finds it impossible to know how much of the history was planned and how much of it was coincidences and destiny. For any scheme to be pulled off, lot of things do need to fall into the right place.I am holding off the fifth star only because political thrillers and conspiracy theories don't hold much interest for me. But Libra really is very impressive.*** I am looking at you American Tabloid. I loved Ellroy's stacatto writing, but it was 600 pages of pretty much the same thing.__________________________________________UPDATE:Libra has been on a long hiatus as I have been occupied with a hundred other things. While I have not been reading this book about JFK's assassination, I did recently happen to drive by the actual location of Kennedy's assassination and the sixth floor museum._____________________________________Second and last chance for DeLillo to impress me. All my GR friends have rated this either 4 or 5 stars (mostly 5). So I am setting my expectations high.If it begins to sound anything like White Noise, it is going straight out of my window.Mr. DeLillo there is a lot of pressure on you. Pull up your socks."], ["\"\nThere's always more to it. This is what history consists of. It is the sum total of things they aren't telling us.\n\"The novel is a tragic, speculative account of the people, places and things leading to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Delillo uses many of the actual words of Oswald and his mom Marguerite, as well as numerous documented facts surrounding the life and times of Lee Harvey Oswald, so that I had difficulty discerning where the public records stop and the fiction begins. This is likely why Delillo takes pains to remind us that his novel makes \"no claim to literal truth\" and that he \"made no attempt to furnish factual answers to any questions raised by the assassination.\"It is significant to note that the several films speculating on Lee Harvey Oswald, a conspiracy and the assassination of JFK, such as Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" from 1991, came after the 1988 publication of Delillo's Libra. Not realizing this, I initially gave the novel only 4 stars when I finished it earlier this year. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am with Delillo's brilliance and imaginative creation.Delillo expertly saves this from being labeled a political novel by his character Nicholas Branch, a researcher who undertakes the nearly impossible task of looking for patterns in a mountain of data and trying distinguish them from mere coincidence. Branch/Delillo concludes that Kennedy's death was the product of a mixture of confederacy and chance, or \"a rambling affair that succeeded in short term mainly due to chance.\" Specifically, Delillo paints Oswald as a lonely and grotesque fringe dweller who becomes the perfect shill for a plot by current and former CIA operatives to take an errant shot at JFK, with the unsuccessful assassination attempt to be blamed on Cuba.To get to the ultimate point, Delillo takes us on a truncated tour through Oswald's life of trying to escape his fate and futilely searching for a place where he could fit in. First and foremost, Lee Harvey spends his life trying to forget that overbearing mother of his, Marguerite, who is both train-wreck compelling and revolting, depicted by Delillo via her unique manner of speech to a judge to whom she provides her list of excuses and complaints for the poverty in which she raised her son and the way he turned out.Then, he is a Marine who, after discharge, defects to Soviet Russia, only to be disappointed in its Westernization and return to the States as a Marxist with a Russian wife. Finally, he sees Cuba as a possible vista.A few things I found uniquely fascinating in this novel. One is the theme of entropy I have seen in other Delillo novels; that is, the fact it's impossible to control people and events pursuant to some type of plan.Second, how Delillo has such an appreciation for the awkward vernacular of professionals, e.g., CIA, and the staccato dialect of the uneducated.Third and most singular is how Delillo shows Oswald as being captivated by media imagery. I cannot help but believe that many of the recent mass murderers also project themselves as being played out in images on living room TV screens. After being shot by Ruby, Oswald imagines how the shot looked on camera. Back in Russia, when he tried to commit suicide just before being expelled, he views his razor slices across his wrist while a violin plays somewhere offstage. Finally, as Lee Harvey fades away, he pans out, watching himself from \"a darkish room, someone's den.\""], ["\u201cFacts are lonely things.\u201d\nAmerican history is profoundly dark in its timeline. From the slaughtering and near genocidal extermination of the Native Americans to the 9/11 attacks, American history presents itself as an almost constant struggle for survival. History has not been so kind when it comes to America. Inevitably, and understandably, it is so very interesting, and the American people are also equally interesting. Their history is internationally relatable due to the ancestral voyages undertaken, and their subjective stories illuminate the overall objectified view of Uncle Sam. Libra refuses to show America from a political, sociological or a generalised historical standpoint. Instead, in Tolstoyan fashion, DeLillo examines the \u2018six seconds that broke the back of the American century\u2019 artistically. Not a single detail is left unnoticed. The scariest part is: What is real? Fact, hypothesis, speculation and fiction are all methodically rolled into one, creating this postmodern odyssey.Libra, an immensely impressive work by American writer Don DeLillo, is one of those books that defines the feeling of America, past, present and future. It\u2019s stylish in its execution, believable in its convictions, thrilling in its story and downright disturbing in its resolution. I remember having these exact feelings whenever I watched the certain episodes of the X-Files\u2014 you know, with governmental corruption, conspiracies and paranoia seeping from every frame. Libra does this, utilising words, and every sentence counts, as he ruthlessly dissects America during the Cold War, leaving the sugarcoating and flag-waving patriotism at the back door.Libra, in all its glory, terrifies the reader with its powerful examination of Lee Harvey Oswald and the events leading up to the assassination of JFK. However, as great as it already is, Libra is so much more than being about Lee Harvey Oswald. DeLillo is reflecting back to America of the 50\u2019s and early 60\u2019s, with visually arresting scenes, taking us back to Cold War era as an artistic tool in order to comment on the America of today. Although written in 1988, it still packs a punch that would immediately startle Sonny Liston, with its messages still unsettling us in our post 9/11 world. Don DeLillo isn\u2019t showcasing the past from a politically oriented point of view, as the book is neither conservative or liberal in its underpinnings; instead, it\u2019s a metaphysical shadow, a nameless dread, that looms over these events, seeing it differently from the grounded senses of a human being. It\u2019s a deeply philosophical look, almost epic in scope and as analytical as anything written by Solzhenitsyn. Like I stated earlier, not a single detail is left unnoticed. How DeLillo accomplished this, I will never know.Don DeLillo places Lee Harvey Oswald as the Great Man, the centre of the universe, the Napoleon of the twentieth century, in his quest for remembrance. From the first page, we are instantly dropped into Lee\u2019s world as a young boy, following his upbringing, his discovery of Marxism, political science, Cuba, the military, Japan, Soviet Russia, military espionage and his increasing bitterness of America. DeLillo hurls the facts at breakneck speed and is relentless in his storytelling, blurring fact and fiction so successfully that I refuse to even separate them, fearing I would ruin a work of artistic genius. I cannot describe how I felt when I read the scene with shot down U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers being interrogated by the Russians. This real life incident was recreated perfectly for the book, and sent paranoid shivers up and down my spine. Philip K. Dick was firm in his views on subjective reality. He believed that \u2018objective reality is a synthetic product\u2019. His written thoughts are permanently embedded in my mind: Reality is illusory, fragmented, highly subjective and downright confusing. Everything from the curious eyes of a human being has to be questioned, measured and analysed extensively before contributing to the past, and even then, did it necessarily happen that way? Or has it been a collective agreement to preserve objectivity? So as the story progresses, reality is laid bare, the past is tested and actions are questioned from the viewpoint of DeLillo, disguised as a fictional agent assigned to piecing the past together years after the event. Here the reader is bombarded with an array of information, paranoia, conspiracy and startling insights into the nature of being, time, existence, DeLillo waxing the philosophical with his stark brutality. In postmodern fashion, our senses are shellshocked and we have to do nothing but go along with the ride.\n\u201cHe questions everything, including the basic suppositions we make about our world of light and shadow, solid objects and ordinary sounds, and our ability to measure such things, to determine weight, mass and direction, to see things as they are, recall them clearly, be able to say what happened.\u201d\nEach page has the power to genuinely unsettle the reader. I recall having to close the book many times in order to breath normally again before reopening the pages. The final part is unforgiving and continuously impressive, evoking nostalgia, invoking fear, advocating a sort of coherent truth. Its tension is utterly superb. The paranoia of the Cold War-world will never fail to disturb. Don\u2019t let that put you off though, as Libra is one of the most powerful statements of America ever written.\n\u201cThe truth of the world is exhausting\u2026\u201d"], ["This fucking book, man, it just leaves me at a complete loss for words. I've heard people discredit the terrific work DeLillo did to make Oswald a compelling and complex character - maybe DeLillo's most compelling and most complex character - because Don was working with a real person and therefore had plenty of raw material to go with, but I insist that it takes just as much talent to sculpt what is known of Oswald (his upbringing, his politics, his time in the war) into a real and weirdly relatable anti-hero. DeLillo pulls him out of the realm of history and makes a goddamn person out of him, and all it takes is a maybe-implausible - but certainly, you cannot deny, all sorts of fun to read about - conspiracy to do so. DeLillo uses that conspiracy as a jumping-off point for an in-depth study of Oswald's motivations; his determination to make a mark on history is pulled against by the plot he finds himself wrapped up in, a plot that puts Oswald on strings and pretty much leaves the strings visible. This is what they talk about when they say \"character-driven writing.\"So what does that make Libra? Proof that DeLillo can do character and write in a more traditional mode? Well, it's still DeLillo, so that's not quite the case. Libra may be a character-driven novel, but it's also a thriller, and a thriller in the DeLillo mode, which means he spoofs some thriller conventions (notably the sudden escalations and ridiculously tangled webs of players vs. players), affirm others (the fast pace, the violence, the political undertones), and stay in the DeLillo-space for still others (the paranoia and conspiracies). DeLillo's a smart guy, so it's hard to take this as some YouTube nutjob yelling his head off about the Grassy Knoll and the holes in the Warren Commission, and yet it's equally hard for me to fully buy into DeLillo's disclaimer at the beginning that insists Libra is intended to be pure speculation and isn't supposed to provide any answers. Which I'm sure is the idea, and could even be a little joke on DeLillo's part, since I'm sure he's aware that he's perceived as existing on the brilliant/crazy faultline by his fans and his detractors alike, but it's hard for me to know what to make of this novel, if it was intended as a straight-but-sophisticated historical thriller (I feel Running Dog is more obviously parody, but this isn't Running Dog), even an attempt to legitimatize the genre, or an Eco-style parody of our fascination with the currents of history. It's also hard for me to know if DeLillo honestly believes what he puts out here. I know Kennedy had his enemies and am not naive enough to believe that politicians don't throw other politicians under the bus on the daily, and yet I wonder if this is the ravings of an exceptionally talented lunatic. I know it's an in-depth analysis of the currents of history centered around a fascinating and often demonized figure, but it could also be completely crazy. Or dead the fuck on. Either way, DeLillo's prose is the best it's ever been, the portrayal of Oswald is masterful, and the montage-style climax is out of this world good. Due for a reread."], ["This one took about a month to read so I should respect that time turning its pages and write a few commemorative words. All I can really say is that on every page the writing reeks of literature, but rarely is it literary. What I mean is that DeLillo's sentences always seem to have an eye on a subtextual prize, that is, they always seem like an updated, abstract response to that question posed long ago by some cavedweller about the meaning of life, as opposed to turns of phrase for the sake of well-crafted whateverness. Any given paragraph is obviously DeLillo. His style is absolutely particularly his, but also it's readable and clear, with lyrical potential, too, but never romantic, or sensory solely for the sake of activating the reader's senses. All characters are part of the whole (society, history, the universe), and all characters have been brought to life solely to speak DeLillo's words. This would annoy if DeLillo had nothing to say, but he has some serious things to say, and so his characters say them, then conspire to kill the president. A particular brand of American anxiety is represented here. This is a difficult review to write. What I should just say is that several times while reading this while walking to work I would laugh out loud at awesome language or a turn or development or insight (rarely at something funny, though humor exists if not necessarily abounds) and sometimes I'd even say out loud that this dude is a freakin' great writer. I should be better able to articulate why I'd say this aloud while walking/reading, but I think it has to do with his authority, ambition, dry-eyed humanity, intelligence/wisdom, scope/range, humor, boldness, the beautifully honed/hefty sentences of course, and also something to do with the structure, how scenes emerge and dissolve (\"boldly\" as Ethan says) without much helpful orientation from the author, and it all seems held together loosely, artfully, in a way that seems like it wants to very carefully, very gently create in the reader a state similar to what's being experienced by the characters? Something like that? It's real good. Maybe his masterpiece, even more so than \"Underworld\"? -- it definitely feels longer (maybe 'cause it's denser?) and goes slower than \"Underworld\" . . . Also, plot-wise, the whole time you know how this one ends, but such knowledge is hardly an annoyance, the opposite in fact, same as with re-reading Hamlet etc."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "- Presents the most important 20th-century criticism on major works from The Odyssey through modern literature- The critical essays reflect a variety of schools of criticism- Contains critical biographies, notes on the contributing critics, a chronology of the author's life, and an index- Introductory essay by Harold Bloom", "author": "Harold Bloom"}, "Neon Lit: Paul Auster's City of Glass": {"average_rating": "3.92", "review": [["A brilliant text reflected in a magic mirror, ideal storyboard for a soundtrack by Philip Glass..."], ["Not only a fantastic, engrossing read, but also the most teachable comic I know.

really unique, a thoughtful, stylish blend of raymond chandler, kafka, and borges. i still like it, but it hasn't aged that well for me. a lot of what i thought was playfulness now seems precious, facile. the prose is polished, but by the same token oddly eroded, flat, sanded down. often it feels like auster doesn't actually inhabit the english language--he reads like he's always already a french translation (which is maybe why he's so popular over there). and anyway, i like exuberence now, headlong run-on rushes and spiky thickets of clauses.this graphic novel, with art by paul karasik and the amazing david mazzuchelli (one of my all time comic book favorites), is another beast entirely. it takes the fine small bones of auster's narration and clothes it in images. they are, individually, simple--black and white, stylized, deliberately cartoonish. but they flow in and out of each other with the exuberance that auster's prose lacks, and it makes all the difference. in the opening sequence, for example, the protagonist looks out a window and sees a brick wall. the lines of the brick wall turn into a cityscape. the cityscape zooms out, and we see a map of the city, a giant maze. and the maze melts and fragments and abstracts, until we're looking at a fingerprint. and then we see that it's an smudge of ink on a piece of paper... amazing."], ["\u0398\u03b1

Even after watching him pick apart the stories for the first 25 pages, one by one and with an assiduous efficiency, you still don't believe they are going to be bad. But then you read the first story, and you start to wonder if this hypothetical scenario of 1980s Pynchon meeting 1950s/60s Pynchon isn't, in fact, too generous: ...if through some as yet undeveloped technology I were to run into him today, how comfortable would I feel about lending him money, or for that matter even stepping down the street to have a beer and talk over old times?Young Pynchon doesn't come off as a dick or even mostly unlikeable, but he doesn't come across as very interesting either. Or, perhaps most surprisingly, as very talented. And here's the silver lining: these stories firmly place the virtuosic talents Pynchon later developed into the realm of possibility for the modestly talented but ambitious would-be writer. Granted, all but one of these stories were written in college, but even so, any previously tempting apotheosis of the man will be permanently erased upon reading these. So that's the good news (I guess). But they aren't much fun to read, and I struggled to remain engaged through each one of them. I'm not going to go into detail about the problems here, mainly because Pynchon does such a damn good job of it in his introduction. It probably goes without saying, however, that any book that peaks with the introduction is in pretty serious trouble."], ["Delinquent JuveniliaIt\u2019s almost inevitable that any author will consider their juvenilia as inferior to their later or more mature works (especially if they made the transition from short stories to fully-fledged and ambitious novels).Thomas Pynchon is no different in his perspective on the five short stories in this collection (which were originally published between 1959 and 1964. Only the last story was published after one of his novels \n(\u201cV.\u201d).\nFrom \u201cUnder the Rose\u201d to \"V.\"It\u2019s generally known that Pynchon was working on all of his first three novels at the same time, but chose to prioritise them differently, both in terms of completion and publication.However, it became apparent from reading the short story \u201cUnder the Rose\u201d (1961) (the fourth in this collection) that there is a creative link between at least this story and the third chapter of \u201cV.\u201d Both works are set in colonial Egypt (Alexandria and Cairo). Both feature the characters Victoria Wren, (the daughter/wife/mistress of) Sir Alastair Wren, Eric/Hugh Bongo-Shaftesbury, Goodfellow, Porpentine and Lepsius. Some of the text is common to both works, although they stand separately. Thus, to criticise the short story is to be equally critical of at least part of the novel. Pynchon himself acknowledges as much when he writes in the Introduction: \n\u201cIf only for its good intentions, I am less annoyed with \u2018Under the Rose\u2019 than with the earlier stuff. I think the characters are a little better, no longer just lying there on the slab but beginning at least to twitch some and blink their eyes open, although their dialogue still suffers from my perennial Bad Ear...Today we expect a complexity of plot and depth of character which are missing from my effort here.\u201d\nPynchon would certainly remedy these deficiencies in \u201cV.\u201d itself, though I think his claim to have a bad ear is unduely harsh, and probably even inaccurate.From \"Weird Crews\" and Gangs to the \"Whole Sick Crew\"Pynchon is most critical of his first story, \u201cThe Small Rain\u201d (1959). It features a company of army men of different levels of responsibility and intelligence. They\u2019re based in Louisiana, when a nearby community is wiped out by a hurricane and they are charged with recovering the bodies of the dead. You could say that this is the beginning of the Pynchonesque collective concept of \u201cthe whole sick crew\u201d, which would later feature in \u201cV.\u201d, as it does in later stories in this collection, like Dennis Flange and his \u201cweird crew\u201d in \u201cLow-Lands\u201d (1960) and Grover Snodd and his \u201cgang\u201d of delinquent boys in \u201cThe Secret Integration\u201d (1964) Integration into the CollectiveThe last of these stories concerns the integration of coloured people into society and school, while the army setting of \u201cThe Small Rain\u201d arguably recognises the importance of the war to greater understanding of other races and creeds (Nathan \u2018Lardass\u2019 Levine, a graduate of CCNY, is described as \u2018the Wandering Jew\u2019).(Mis-)EntropyI had never previously read the story \u201cEntropy\u201d (1960), although I had suspected that its importance to Pynchon\u2019s ouvre might have been exaggerated by academics and critics. The Introduction certainly provides plenty of fodder for this opinion. Pynchon responds to the story with a \u201cbleakness of heart\u201d, describing it as an example of a \u201cprocedural error\u2026to begin with a theme, symbol or other abstract unifying agent, and then try to force characters and events to conform to it.\u201dThe story itself is based on superficial notes Pynchon took from his reading of scientific texts, not some profound pre-existing knowledge (\u201cSince I wrote this story I have kept trying to understand entropy, but my grasp becomes less sure the more I read\u201d). Here is what Pynchon says in the story itself:\n\u201c\u2018Nevertheless,\u2019 continued Callisto, \u2018he [Willard Gibbs] found in entropy or the measure of disorganization for a closed system an adequate metaphor to apply to certain phenomena in his own world. He saw, for example, the younger generation responding to Madison Avenue with the same spleen his own had once reserved for Wall Street: and in American \u2018consumerism\u2019 discovered a similar tendency from the least to the most probable, from differentiation to sameness, from ordered individuality to a kind of chaos. He found himself, in short, restating [Willard] Gibbs\u2019 prediction in social terms, and envisioned a heat-death for his culture in which ideas, like heat-energy would no longer be transferred, since each point in it would ultimately have the same quantity of energy; and intellectual motion would, accordingly, cease.\u201d\nAn Expansion of PossibilitiesThis quotation establishes a context of social science, rather than a wholesale adoption of information or systems theory.It also echoes Pynchon\u2019s comments in the Introduction about the position of his generation between Modernism and what would (or might) succeed it:\n\u201cWe were encouraged from many directions - Kerouac and the Beat writers, the diction of Saul Bellow in \u2018The Adventures of Augie March\u2019, emerging voices like those of Herbert Gold and Philip Roth - to see how at least two very distinct kinds of English could be allowed to coexist. Allowed! It was actually OK to write like this! Who knew? The effect was exciting, liberating, strongly positive. It was not a case of either/or, but an expansion of possibilities. I don\u2019t think we were consciously groping after any synthesis, although perhaps we should have been.\u201cThe success of the \u2018new left\u2019 later in the \u201860\u2019s was to be limited by the failure of college kids and blue-collar workers to get together politically. One reason was the presence of real, invisible class force fields in the way of communication between the two groups.\u201d\n\nOld Left NuancesI\u2019ve argued elsewhere that Pynchon\u2019s support or sympathy for the Old Left surfaces in \n\u201cVineland\u201d\n and \n\u201cBleeding Edge\u201d.\n To focus exclusively and obsessively on Pynchon\u2019s Post-Modernism and paranoia is to place him in a category within which he doesn\u2019t always belong or sit comfortably, and to underestimate the nuances of his political concerns as an individual and an author.It\u2019s interesting in this context that Pynchon describes as \u201cmighty influences\u201d Edmund Wilson\u2019s \n\u201cTo the Finland Station\u201d\n and Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cThe Prince\u201d.It\u2019s also worth highlighting that Pynchon sought \u201can expansion of possibilities\u201d in contrast to John Barth\u2019s \u201cliterature of exhaustion\u201d. The answer was and is to be found in the writer\u2019s individualism rather than their compliance with (by now tired Post-Modernist) proscriptions."], ["Worth it for the introduction alone.

The self-deprecating introduction really sets the tone, downplaying expectations and welcoming the reader to just relax a bit and enjoy the flawed stories. These five stories include the first four stories Pynchon published. They were apparently no minor item, as they got noticed and put Pynchon on the map of a small literary crowd before his first book came out. The introduction alone was worth the book. Pynchon is notoriously reclusive, but his introduction is very open. He complains about how amateur these works are and expresses regret over the things he forced into these stories to try to make them more literary. This self-criticism is somehow both a bit in mock and very sincere. It's also spot on, interesting, and charming. The Small Rain 1959A low level army tech takes a minor roll in hurricane response. The hurricane was unexpected, deadly, and actually happened. The response becomes body recovery. This was my favorite story as it works on a simple level - an unusual and casual, almost accidental confrontation with death. It just manages to become more than it is. Low-Lands 1960A man's wife kicks him out of the house. He spends a night in a garbage dump with the overseer. There is a lot of Greek mythology references and a element of horror. Curious.Entropy 1960Actually a kind of cool story that involves a wacky party and the odd young couple one floor below, pondering entropy. But, if I can pretend to give analysis, and this kind of story will encourage you to pretend to do the same, the point seems to be his use of the word entropy in a story context - both giving new meaning to and coloring the entire story. It's one of those interesting ideas I find hard to grasp of all at once. The wild parties become something that cannot hold, if you like. They expend more than what can be replaced. And they become directional, leading toward an end, without ever touching on this directly. Not sure I have it right, or close, but it makes sense to me. It also really defines the sense of everything in V. and Gravity's Rainbow - for him it's a foundational concept. \"The cosmologists had predicted an eventual heat-death for the universe (something like Limbo: form and motion abolished, heat-energy identical at every point in it); the meteorologists, day-to-day, staved it off by contradicting with a reassuring array of varied temperatures.But for three days now, despite the changeful weather, the mercury had stayed at 37 degrees Fahrenheit.\"Under the Rose 1961A take on the tricky world of Fin de si\u00e8cle espionage, where principals seems to play an important, but hard to define roll. This becomes a chapter in V., with some differences. I didn't like it in V. and I didn't like it any better as a standalone. I found it a snobbish effort.The Secret Integration 1964This story actually post-dates V.. The story is, in a nutshell, boys behaving badly. But Pynchon adds and works on a complicated racial element. The boys \"integrate\" themselves with an imaginary black boy, patting themselves on the back for their forwardness, until the town's reality weighs in too heavily. It's both great and not, depending on how you look at it, and there are many different ways. I thought the racial element was forced."], ["Borderline juvenilia.

Introduction otherwise has thoughtful comments on entropy, author\u2019s influences, and the nifty comment that his reading allowed \u201cWorld War I in my imagination to assume the shape of that attractive nuisance so dear to adolescent minds, the apocalyptic showdown\u201d (18).Principal text is five short fictions, all generally haunted by the spectre of the Korean civil war (expressly at 44, 61, 172, and implicitly in the others, it seems)First short is a military man down on the bayou.

Third, \u201cEntropy,\u201d seems to be well-regarded, presents a soiree that host-protagonist wants to stop \u201cfrom deteriorating into total chaos\u201d (97). Fourth is fin de siecle espionage thriller of orientalist interest, but we should read it in the context of the cold war.

Declasse, Foreign Minister of a newly formed French cabinet, would as soon go to war as not if there were any trouble when the two detachments met. As meet, everyone realized by now, they would. Kitchener had been instructed not to take any offensive and to avoid all provocation. Russia would support France in case of war, while England had a temporary rapprochement with Germany, which of course meant Italy and Austria as well\u201d (106). But: \u201cAll he asked was that eventually there be a war. Not just a small incidental skirmish in the race to carve up Africa, but one pip-pip, jolly ho, up-goes-the-balloon Armageddon for Europe\u201d (107).

He's very funny and there is a certain amount of charm in how he looks at his work when he was young... and before he became the icon that he is now. The only book I have read all the way through is his last novel \"Inherent Vice\" which I loved, because it reminded me of my youth in Southern California and all the references both culturally and actual stores in actual locations are just perfect. The other book I love is \"Against the Day\" and I stopped reading it half-way through. Not due to the book itself, but I think more due to life at the time. It was such a rich experience to go through that book, and it is one of the few pieces of literature, where I thought this guy is actually a genius. And yes i will finish that book!The short stories here are very so-so, but has touches of his brilliance but not totally formed yet. I think the short story format is too restrictive for Pynchon - he needs the big scale 70mm book print to get his ideas across. And even that its difficult due to his narratives, which are deeply textured and not simple by any means. He's a writer where you really think about the research he has done and the way he conveys or writes his thoughts down on paper - it is not a book about his personal life, but the life that lives in his head."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "A collection of critical essays discuss the works of the American novelist.", "author": "Harold Bloom"}, "Democracy": {"average_rating": "3.82", "review": [["LA PAROLA PERFETTA Pubblicato nel 1984, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDemocracy' \u00c3\u00a8 il quarto romanzo di Joan Didion, da molti considerato il suo migliore.Forse il migliore lo \u00c3\u00a8 davvero, ma \u00c3\u00a8 comunque una bella gara, sono uno pi\u00c3\u00b9 bello dell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122altro.Isole e palme e mare e cieli cangianti (non solo per i tramonti, anche per gli esperimenti atomici).Scrive Edoardo Nesi: Non sono mai stato capace di decidere se dell'opera narrativa di Joan Didion ammiro pi\u00c3\u00b9 l'esattezza chirurgica dello stile o il distante calore delle lievi, sospese trame; le esemplari descrizioni dei cieli e del sole e delle albe o la glaciale delicatezza con cui sa raccontare il dolore che riempie le tenere e durissime storie d'amore perduto che sempre riempiono e definiscono le sue eroine - perch\u00c3\u00a9, com'\u00c3\u00a8 giusto, \u00c3\u00a8 sempre una donna il personaggio pi\u00c3\u00b9 importante dei suoi romanzi.Condivido pienamente il suo entusiasmo per questa scrittrice, per questa artista il cui stile \u00c3\u00a8 come il canto di una sirena, con la sua insistita incessante riscrittura, alla ricerca della parola perfetta (le mot juste, avrebbe detto Flaubert), con quel suo incedere da mantra in effetto stereofonia.In fondo (in fondo!) si tratta di storie d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122amore, per lo pi\u00c3\u00b9 amore perduto, amore sofferto, amore incerto, amore incompreso, amore combattuto.

I kind of want to get a gazillion votes for this review just so that it will come before some of the nonsense in the other reviews. Any talk of post-modernism or meta-fiction or there being too many characters in this novel (there aren't that many, more than say the one in certain Beckett works, but less than in a Dickens or Pynchon novel), also plug the ears in your head that listen when you are reading to any of cries that the book is dull or that harp too heavily upon the plot for better or for worse. Just ignore all that stuff (and probably most of what I'm going to say too, but not really because I want you to read this and I want your vote, it's important to me to get ahead of these other reviews). The only thing you need to know about this book is that it is crushingly beautiful. Not flowery pretty, or the literary equivalent of some replaceable blond starlet that graces the cover of gossip mags; but awkwardly gorgeous, insert your own parallelism to the blond starlet here. The book starts:The light at dawn during those Pacific tests was something to see.Something to behold.Something that could almost make you think you saw God, he said.He said to her.Jack Lovett said to Inez Victor.Inez Victor who was born Inez Christian.These short sentence long paragraphs could have been condensed into something like, \"The light at dawn during those Pacific tests was something to see. They were something to behold and almost make you think you saw God,\" Jack Lovett said to Inez Victor (nee Christian). Instead, Didion pulls the reader immediately into an intimacy between the two characters. Without having to say it the signals are present that these people share a closeness, it's like some of the great opening sentences from Raymond Carver stories that paint whole nuanced paintings with broadly sparse paint strokes. It's never said where Jack Lovett says these words to Inez Victor, who was born Inez Christian, but the repetitions that move slowly in on to the subjects being said feel like an intimacy of two people laying close to one another, as opposed to the simple way I rewrote this section to read like something someone is saying to someone someplace that could be anyone and anywhere. I love the way she opens this book, and I'd go quoting a bit more, but at the next line she pulls back the perspective a little and gives a longer paragraph describing parts of the scene surrounding a the atomic bomb tests, and I don't really like quoting long blocks of text. Throughout the book, Didion moves between different perspectives, controlling them through the way she chooses to write, instead of always having to explicitly state what she is trying to achieve. She does get explicit at times, and some reviewers seemed to find this annoying since she inserts herself, as the author, into the work, but I'd argue it isn't a literary trick she's pulling but uses it as a way to move about the themes of the novel. If the story were told from a traditional third person point of view quite a bit would be lost. Partially this is a novel about perspective, about the past and history and stories and it's about myths, and where the truth lies between all of what I just rambled out like a grocery list. I feel like I'm sort of rewriting my defense of the narrator for the YA book, The Book Thief. I guess I am. Good read that review for some more on this I guess. This isn't an exciting book. The basic plot of the whole novel is given in the first couple of chapters. Most of the story the reader knows before the book is half-way through. Roughly it's about some events that happen in the Spring of 1975 as the United States is preparing to evacuate from Vietnam. The historical events taking place are mixed with the personal lives of the characters and the reader is left to draw the lines between macro and micro happenings and can use the books title Democracy as an ideal and an irony when applied to an export to third world countries at the barrel of a gun to construct a myriad of themes. There are quite a few different readings this book could be given, and for such a short novel Didion manages to pack a lot of big Ideas into the work. Even though there are a lot of big Ideas at work Didion never grabs the reader and forces him or her to have to confront them. The novel could be enjoyed as a love story, or a family tragedy; or as a slightly more humanist perspective to the world that James Ellroy's Blood's a Rover frolics in. But none of that last paragraph is really that important to know. What is important to know is that the book is gorgeous. It's the kind of book that can be savored for the way the author deftly moves along, I guess like literature for literatures sake. I'd almost not want to recommend other people to read it, I might feel hurt if they didn't find it as good as I did, but I will recommend it. But only to readers who I know aren't reading novels just to get from point A to point B.P.S. I kind of want to read everything by Joan Didion now. I think she might even move into my favorite writers category. Sort of like Don DeLillo and Cynthia Ozick, I just didn't pay much attention to her and now I think I might have been depriving myself of something awesome. I'm going to cautiously call her an up and coming favorite of mine until I read a couple of more books. It makes me so happy when I realize there are great writers whom I never paid much attention to and now I can look forward to reading them."], ["At first sight the words charm and harm differ in one letter only but the contrast in their meaning is dramatic. Strangely enough, 'Democracy' by Joan Didion has charmed me and harmed me at the same time.\u2018Democracy\u2019 has charmed me. The first thing that enchanted me instantly was Joan Didion\u2019s writing style. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that before. The unsettling, highly addictive rhythm of her sentences, with many cadenced repetitions and anaphoras, resonated with me like music which goes smoothly straight to your heart. I was flabbergasted by Didion\u2019s ability to affect me so much with so few words. Isaac Babel points out, 'No iron can stab the heart with such force as a period put just at the right place' and it seems so true in Joan Didion's case also. Although 'Democracy' provokes strong emotions, it\u2019s far from sentimental. Her style is harsh at times, like her characters. Ah, the way she depicts the feelings flowing between Inez and Jack every time they meet! It made me think of 'Casablanca': scarce words, extreme tension.The descriptions in \"Democracy' are concise but the world she paints with words bursts with colours and smells: 'When Inez remembered that week in Jakarta in 1969 she remembered mainly the cloud cover that hung low over the city and trapped the fumes of sewage and automobile exhaust and rotting vegetation as in a fetid greenhouse. She remembered the cloud cover and she remembered lightning flickering on the horizon before dawn and she remembered rain washing wild orchids into the milky waste ditches.'Trying to analyze the mechanisms Joan Didion uses to make her prose so original and mesmerizing, would be like catching her words in the net and pinning them like exotic butterflies. Sorry, I\u2019m not going to do that. I prefer to let them float around me and watch them in awe and just sense them with delight.As for topics and genres, \u201cDemocracy\u201d reminds me of a multilayered cake. Don\u2019t expect any sweetness though! It\u2019s more like a strong espresso which will burn your lips and make your heart pulsate faster. You will discover many floors of Didion's amazing construction. Politics, modern history, family, love, writing a novel, being a writer, to name just a few. It\u2019s a novel, a love story, a crime story, a reportage and an essay at the same time. The narrator is Joan Didion herself who happens to know some characters in person and who shares thoughts about creating this novel and writing in general. The structure of 'Democracy' made me also think of a film. Gosh, the scene in the bar could be dazzling, with Inez dancing not as 'you or I or the agency that regulated dancing in bars might have defined dancing'.My experience with this novel proves that reaching out of comfort zone can be extremely rewarding. It was Orsodimondo, who got me interested in Joan Didion\u2019s works, and I am very grateful for his encouragement.\u2018Democracy\u2019 has harmed me. Everything I try to read now seems tasteless and colourless compared to Joan Didion\u2019s novel."], ["When I first read this book in 1984 I was absolutely staggered. Immediately, I flipped back to the beginning and read it again. I'm sure I've read it a couple of more times since, and this latest re-read has merely confirmed that this must be my all-time favorite book. Although I've been land-locked for the past number of years, I am -- in essence -- a person of the Pacific, and Didion's book IS the Pacific.Still, it's a complicated little book and demands more from the reader than most. One must pay attention to all the tiny details and have more than a passing knowledge of the locales -- from Hawaii, to Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and the scattered islands in between (Guam, Kwajalein, Johnston) -- including the names of the airports, the capitals and the history of these places in the 50s, 60s, 70s.The title is curious. I've never heard a definitive explanation for it, only hints of it being compared to Henry Adams' book of the same title. My take is that it's an ironic title. The book is actually about American colonialism -- our original takeover of Hawaii and our hubris in thinking a war in Vietnam was 1) winnable and 2) appreciated by that country.But mostly I love this book for the sound of it -- the prose is like poetry and begs to be read aloud. It is, in fact, a mystery, a romance, and a political critique -- but clothed in shear elegance."], ["The first meeting of Inez Christian and Jack Lovett at the ballet - the beginning of Lovett's \"grave attraction\" that would last over twenty years - is the sexiest scene I've read in a while:Cissy Christian smoking a cigarette in her white jade holder.

A tutti coloro che non fanno parte della storia, quella dei cocktail e delle luci a bordo piscina, degli aerei privati che decollano nelle notti profumate delle Hawaii, delle residenze coloniali dove arrivano attutite le notizie di fughe, di incendi, di esplosioni, di morte, dietro quella patina fatta di abiti leggeri e impalpabili, di sorrisi tirati, di verit\u00e0 conosciute da nessuno ma sussurrate da tutti.E poi vira, Joan Didion, vira sul porpora, quando racconta di Inez e di Jack Lovett, di quel magnetismo che solo le sue parole, e i loro sguardi, riescono a narrare, regalando alla storia una storia d'amore (o di magnetismo?) che ha il profumo di gardenie e jacaranda, la carezza dei venti tropicali, il respiro di una passione che, come gi\u00e0 quella che Graham Green raccontava in Un Americano Tranquillo, ha i colori cupi di una fine che sembra gi\u00e0 annunciata.Ma con Joan Didion ormai, l'ho capito, l'abbiamo capito, non c'\u00e8 mai niente di veramente annunciato, nemmeno quando la storia inizia dalla sua fine: perch\u00e9 la fine \u00e8 nota, ma non \u00e8 detto.\u00abComunque siamo stati insieme\u00bb disse. \u00abSiamo stati insieme tutta la vita.

It is a masterpiece. Democracy is Joan Didion\u2019s fourth novel, preceded by Run River, Play It As It Lays and A Book of Common Prayer. It was published in 1984. The novel takes place between Honolulu and Jakarta at the hemorrhaging end of the Vietnam War. It is written as a kind of memoir of Inez Victor, wife of U.S. Senator Harry Victor, told from the perspective of a peculiar narrator. The narrator is none other than Joan Didion. She is also the self-conscious author of the novel and explains to the reader how this narrative could have been written differently, interjecting the authorial voice within its narrative. It is a stunning literary achievement and this device is remarkably effective. I found myself reading passages twice as she talks about how they were constructed and why. The technique is so effective that you\u2019ll be craving its craftiness in whatever you read next."], ["As much as I am a fan of \"Slouching Toward Bethlehem,\" I think that this is my favorite Joan Didion book. It presumes so much on the part of the reader -- that we already know about the intricacies of the characters' lives and the underbelly of the Vietnam War, and more so, that we care about any of it. In this book, Didion does not seem to write at all for the reader. She seems to be writing to answer some question whispering to her inside her own thoughts. While the novel \"The Descendants\" (I read the book and saw the movie) clearly strives to explain/explore/speak to the bizarre aristocracy/social hierarchies of the Hawaiian Islands, \"Democracy\" is the book to turn to if a person wants a truly insightful view into this world (not to mention the worlds of politics and dysfunctional families). Because, as with any insider, this book does not give away all of its secrets. It builds a (very loose) foundation based on the murder of the daughter of a prominent Hawaii family (she is also the sister-in-law of a prominent senator), then skims and skirts around this event with a litheness and absolute disinterest in me as the reader that makes me green with envy."], ["Edizioni e/o ripropone il quarto romanzo di Joan Didion, pubblicato originariamente nel 1984. In Democracy si notano alcune somiglianze con il precedente Diglielo da parte mia. Viene ripreso il setting esotico (questa volta Kuala Lumpur e Honolulu), ma soprattutto la rappresentazione di una protagonista femminile, Inez, che si dibatte tra le maglie di una famiglia soffocante nella sua imponenza. Joan Didion \u00e8 voce narrante e personaggio del romanzo, con l\u2019ipotetico intento di dare all\u2019opera il sapore della non-fiction. Democracy assume cos\u00ec i toni di un falso New Journalism, oltre a quelli della metaletteratura. Ma l\u2019espediente in s\u00e9 non cambia in modo essenziale la calibratura del libro. L\u2019esplorazione si svolge attorno a Inez, alla sua provenienza da una famiglia colonialista e al suo ruolo marginale nella vita politica del marito, senatore statunitense candidato alle primarie. La fine del conflitto in Vietnam fa da sfondo, contornato dal rapporto di Inez con quello che probabilmente \u00e8 un agente della C.I.A. La storia si dipana in modo volutamente frammentario tra gli U.S.A., l\u2019Asia e il Pacifico, in un cosmo dove i personaggi si muovono come spettri.

How could it be otherwise with a title like that? Yet, it lives up to the title: aiming and broadly succeeding to argue the causes for collapse. It's a little ponderous to read, because it is documented and reasoned like a thesis. This is a historical analysis, with applicability to our age that's noted only lightly along the way: it's not a political position paper, though it could be.Tainter says diminishing returns eventually trap civilization in a no-win situation. The idea of diminishing returns (well explored) meaning that more fertilizer, internet, railroads and regulations produce more food per man-hour invested, but only to a point. Eventually the return on investment tapers to nothing, and then further effort would actually COST energy, blood and treasure. ...and critically, you can't go back.I don't think he successfully argues why we can't step back from that precipice, why for instance the diminishing returns aren't their own regulator, moreso because the broad curve of lost benefit implies a smooth hilltop, not a cliff (My precipice description makes Tainter's point, but it seems inaccurate to describe the actual dynamics.) It seems pretty simple negative feedback: the farmer eventually looks at a JET powered tractor, (plows 20% faster, but uses 3x the gas) & thinks, \"no thanks.\" There IS a valid issue of \"measurement delays\" though. Maybe when you're a city planner contemplating a bridge too far it's not obvious that it's total cost/value is a losing proposition. Surely there will someday be one road too many, if not already!Another possibility (I'm trying to cinch down the last loose knot on his thesis, you see) is that the complexity is a house of cards. A famous \"cappuccino\" speech (by Greenspan) trumpets the hyper-complicated chain of products that enables something as wonderful and only SEEMINGLY simple as a cappuccino: where'd the ore for the selenium cobalt in the magnets in the electric motor that ground the beans come from? If our system is interdependent (and surely it is for is not the efficiency derived substantially from specialization that interdependence allows?) then perhaps because of fragility it cannot regress to a simpler time. There is no retrenchment possible; removing a keystone will bring it all down, and every stone is a keystone.A final idea I'll offer is that we become addicted. Not in a bad way either. We are addicted in that we want to support our population: it's not o.k. with us if people die. But that's what will happen because, as we expand our capability (e.g. the green revolution that fed Asia), we respond by literally eating up that excess capacity. Some of it goes into luxury, but lots goes into people too, and we are thereby committed to the additional technology. I heard a great study about a lane mover that would increase one way traffic on the I-70 corridor during ski season. 50% less crowds? No, the crowds will respond, said the analysis, and it'll just be 50% more people skiing, with the same traffic jam as ever. I believe it! We invent an improvement and then gobble up it's benefit instead of banking it away against lean times. So the change becomes not really an improvement, but instead a permanent commitment to additional infrastructure, additional complexity. In Skinner's Walden II they lived a life of ease founded upon 30% more efficient work habits. Why then don't I live a life of ease with (the US average) 10kW at my disposal? That's the equivalent of a dozen horses, working for me 24/7. The answer is that we use it up. Also I suppose I DO live a life of ease and luxury in comparison to a 19th century Russian peasant with only one actual horse in his stable. Anyway, Tainter does talk about this obliquely at one point.Re-reading my review a year later, both Tainter's analysis and mine leave me uncomfortable, unsatisfied. Trying to be succinct, I don't think it's about diminishing returns, but about slack and momentum. Consumption of all the slack technology provides leads to an irrevocable commitment to complexity and interdependency. \"Commitment\" is the mouths to feed, and it's the inertia you need to make instability possible. Commitment means you can't retrench to simpler technology in a bad year because the greater efficiency has become the new minimum baseline. Now you're in danger of actual collapse.One more last thought (how many \"last thoughts\" is one allowed?) is that maybe the famous hidden \"negative externalities\" provide the extra lag in measurement that could trip us over the self limiting point of diminishing returns and into an unsustainable vicious cycle of collapse.

Only soil, Diamond's favorite limited resource, could be more apt.

Tainter does a good job with his argument, which I admit even I though I disagree with it in part.  His argument boils down to a few key points:1. Major civilizations tend to experience an early period of rapid growth through the 'low hanging fruit' of available territory, resources, etc. When 2. This growth inevitably leads to specialization, stratification, and complexity which initially serves growth3. The civilization plateau's and the structure established to help it grow becomes a part of society.4. When the 'low hanging fruit' disappears, further expansion (be it territorial, trade oriented) becomes less and less profitable, and eventually starts to work against the civilization.5. Finally, the complex structure begins to a positive drain on the civilization as it has to spend more and more to get less and less. But now we depend on the structure, which has become brittle, and like a house of cards, easy to knock over.Tainter supports his theory well from civilizations across time, and uses very obvious info, like territory, and some other more unusual information, like crop yields, colonial administrations, and so on. No doubt there are many lessons for economists here.But -- while his book is valuable, it has big holes.In his quest for absolute objectivity, he rejects all value-judgment theories of collapse. If you can't measure it, it's not useful. A civilizations beliefs, or our interpretation of those beliefs are not 'objective' and so have nothing to contribute to the study of collapse. So, after summarizing the work of people like Gibbon, Toynbee, Spengler, and others he essentially dismisses with a wave of his hand. But as C.S. Lewis once pointed out, very few people are actually German economists. Any study of history must involve people, which will involve more than economic exchanges.This over-emphasizing of economics shows up in what is actually a thought provoking idea. What happens after collapse, he argues, may actually be beneficial to society, because it removes a great deal of inefficiency that the old system labored under. Collapse, might be the cleansing forest fires of history, events to almost welcome.This sounds good on paper, but no actual human being who lived through collapses would have agreed with him. Imagine living in Western Europe ca. 550 AD and thinking, \"Boy, I sure am glad for the fall of Rome. Of course, our ramshackle village could be overrun, destroyed, and our people pillaged who knows when by some Goth, Ostrogoth, Visigoth, Vandal, Hun, or some other kind of Goth I have forgotten about. But I'll take that any day over the economic inefficiency of the late Roman Empire.\"To augment Chesterton's oft quoted phrase, \"If civilization is worth doing, it's worth doing badly.\""], ["First off, this is more like a long academic paper than a book. Tainter has a thesis whereby he attempts to explain the collapse of all complex societies (quite a tall order of business) and goes about this by establishing a lot of background information and existing theory review in the first part of the book.I am by no means an archeologist (professional or amateur) but was able to make my way through this part, picking most of what Tainter was trying to communicate. I'd say to give the early sections a shot because they do form the basis for his later arguments. Sort of scary in retrospect how many complex, seemingly stable societies basically evaporated over the course of only a few generations and that civilization as we know it has a relatively short existence compared to the totality of human existence. Civilization is more the exception than the rule.So the crux of Tainter's argument is that the development of a complex society is predicated on the explotation of low hanging resources. The investment to acquire these resources is (at first) easily outwighed by their benefits. This allows for the support of specialized roles that do not necessarily contribute to the sustainability of the society (aristocrats, priest castes, etc.). Subsequent resource extraction (be it in the form of new mines, new agricultural lands, or new conquests) have a lower return on energy invested generating a smaller surplus to sustain the complex society.Eventually a society will reach a point where existing resources or potential new resources cannot maintain the level of complexity the society currently has. The result is a decline in public works/investments, the loss of centralized control and influence, and the loss of the periphery regions of the society (and not always a peaceful or gradual process). Eventually the society will \"decline\" to a level of lower complexity: more local control, less public works, etc.To Tainter the story of a complex society is a race against the resource clock. To maintain and expand complexity (which is a good strategy when new resources are low investment accessible) a society must continue to increase the amount of resources available to it to support classes that do not contribute to resource expansion. Just to maintain the status quo new resources are needed and when they are not available the center of the complex society begins to crumble.I really enjoyed this book because of the unique perspective Tainter presents in explaining the collapse of complex societies. The examples he provides are quite illustrative and can provide guidance to the challenges we face today. I'm not going to lie, this book majorly bummed me out, but I'd rather we had this perspective and a chance to avoid past mistakes than blindly blunder into the same fate that has befallen many past societies."], ["Now THIS is a fantastic book! Normally I am a bit skeptical of the analysis of historians as they seem to often have soft logic, often recurring to very subjective values or opinions, and telling long and boring stories about concepts such as heroism, some small details, series of random eveniments and such things, which are all good and great, but seem to me to have little explanatory power... NOT THIS BOOK though! I was delighted to see the author picking a large spectrum of historical events in the treatment of hist subject, trying to pick common and logical similarities and differences that would allow one to form a bigger picture! I was delighted that he found through his research evidence of some things i have long partially suspected and that he is quite mercilessly critical of theories which ascribe collapse of certain societies to invasions, moral weakness, natural events or resource depletions, even though often the same civilization had not that long ago proven more than resilient and able to deal with relatively bigger invasions, resource shocks or series of coincidences. Instead his analysis of Mayan, Roman, Cacoan civilizations (and others, but these mainly) lead him to arrive at a bigger theory, that seems to explain much better and analytically all of the cases and even cases which are given unsatisfactory answers by other historians leading them to say obscure stuff such as \"this great civilization disappeared suddenly and without reason\".The explanation, he finds has to do with society's investment in complexity: in the initial stages people get great advantages from investments in society & complexity, security, protection, organization, safety against random but recurring events, however as they grow societies reach levels so complex that additional investments in complexity produce diminishing returns, until they reach a point where it pays for them to go back to lower levels of complexity. I also love that unlike most authors he does not have this super negative view of these collapses that one often encounters, and far from threating them as failures to adapt realizes that they are in fact great successes in adapting, even though the adaptation might be in a direction that many dislike. He identifies many of our biases, including the biases of historians and culture people to see these collapses as negative events even though they might have been positive steps for the actual real people living then then there: living in an advanced complex world we only see values in such complex things, and historians/archeologists/art collectors/philosophers feel value only in the works of complex civilizations, as they are grand and imposing and well kept, even if they were produced at the edge of the precipice, at great social and human costs and in inefficient ways. Of the many fantastic examples in the book one of the most interesting is the fall of the roman empire in the 4-5th centuries when a traditional historian might say that roman provinces fell under barbarian conquest the author brings forth evidence that many of the peasants, long exhausted by the roman bureaucratic parasitic aparatus not only became apathetic towards the roman empire but actually invited the barbarians to conquer them as their lives would improve with lower taxes for the same or better levels of protection. Indeed they were to be proven right in time as for the centuries to come these decentralized units were better able to protect at much smaller costs. I find such historical examples very interesting and relevant in our age when centralization and bureaucratization has become such a huge taxing burden on the back of society. This and the many historical examples of what has in the past happened to the freedom/money/wealth of the peoples who's governments have constantly expanded, first naturally and then by growing deeper and deeper into debt should be an eye opening view into the past for things that are probably going to happen again and again... well, at least as long as humans remain humans :P Brilliant book! I warmly recommend it to anybody who's willing to learn from the experiences of our grand-grand-grand-grand-grand... fathers"], ["Very good: much better than Jared Diamond's _Collapse_, and much more convincing than Spengler or Toynbee.It was also deeply disturbing - the Ik amazed me in chapter 1, and the statistics in chapter 4 were extremely dismal and tie in far too well to Cowen's _The Great Stagnation_ and Murray's _Human Accomplishment_. There are a great many datapoints suggesting that diminishing marginal returns to modern tech/science began sometime in the late 1800s/early 1900s..."], ["What do we talk about when we talk about the collapse of complex societies? Tainter performs a service to posterity, throwing out all the old rhetoric of moaners and naysayers, blindly reading their own bias into the tea leaves sitting atop the stinking garbage heap of history. Let\u2019s look at the data, he says. Let\u2019s be reasonable, he says. It is a very reasonable start and encouraging\u2014refreshing even, to be able to sit back and disregard so many ridiculous reasons that complex things fall apart. Tainter\u2019s theory is a combination of classic economics and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Increasing complexity requires increasing amounts of energy inputs, and when those inputs cease to produce outputs equal to or greater than the cost of the inputs, society devolves to lesser and lesser complexity until the outputs again meet or exceed the cost of the inputs. Why do outputs have to exceed inputs? Tainter concedes that not everyone is greedy (without defining the term\u2014Greed can be defined as requiring for oneself more than others have, and also more than one had the previous year/week/day). But the need for a society to continually produce more than its inputs seems to be linked to this phenomenon in some way. In dismissing his consideration of greed, Tainter points out that greed, like the poor, will always be with us. We cannot delve into the wormhole of human psychology, he says, because if you are trying to build a model, you have to be able to account for your variables. What is the point of building a model? To try to understand a phenomenon, to try to get at its roots so that you can perhaps manipulate it in the future, to cure some forms of human blindness, a commendable motive. Tainter selects three collapses on which to test his diminishing returns theory: the Roman Empire, the Mayans, and the canyon dwellers of the North American southwest (Chacoans).The sparse Mayan and Chacoan data do not contradict, and seem to fit, his theory, but the bulk of his analysis is spent on the Roman Empire, which presumably has data galore. For the Roman analysis, though, he does not show us charts of input costs and outputs. Rather, we get a lot of description. The Roman Empire grew so long as it had some other territory to invade and tax; the sums raised by conquest compared favorably to the cost of campaign (returns were good, the market was up!). But the running costs of administration, garrison and defense became burdensome, and the Romans, at heart soldiers, not accountants, couldn\u2019t hack it. (They did not do a lot of forward looking modeling, and apparently did not work much with percentages, because, on his description, they were unable to obtain increases in tax revenue with rising income or inflation, but instead were forced to raise fixed amounts of taxes and/or debase the currency in order to maintain their revenue stream.) In the evaluation section, Tainter describes the Roman collapse as due to inflation, taxes and regulation, the combination of which so reduced the marginal return to peasants that, after years of plague, the central government lost the support of the local regions. The impacts of inflation (devaluation) and the plague are self-evident, but Tainter has only mentioned regulations once in his analysis section. After devaluation of coinage, his main discussion has been about taxes. His focus on regulations and taxes makes one feel Tainter is in with the Chi-town gang. But there is another point demonstrated by his long description that he misses: the way wealth draws resources unto itself. Here\u2019s Tainter on the Roman collapse: \u201cThe wealthy, as long as they avoided injudicious political entanglements, generally continued to fare well. Large landowners emerged during the third century in increased numbers in all parts of the Empire. The middle class in towns, however, was burdened by the cost of civil obligations. \u2026 Small peasant proprietors lost their holdings, attaching themselves as tenants to large estates. \u2026 The rate of taxation was generally not progressive, so it rested more heavily on the poor. \u2026 When wealthy influentials got their land under-assessed, the extra share was distributed among the remainder.\u201d Tenant farmers were worse off in the long run: \u201cAs tenants they paid 1/2 their crops in rent, while proprietors owed 1/3 in taxes.\u201d This means that the tax burden was less burdensome than the rent burden, but Tainter does not dwell on it.So the plague would have had the effect of a severe recession, and owners who no longer had the labor resources to make their land produce enough for the land tax would have to abandon it or sell to wealthy landowners, much like the wealthy have the extra resources to increase their investments in a downturn and acquire more income producing property at lower rates which they continue to own in the next upturn. Tainter blames the Roman government for overtaxing the peasants, and certainly taxes should have been relaxed during and after the plague, but the purpose of doing so would not be only to lessen the burden on the middle class (his term), but also to restrain the amalgamation process that is so natural to wealth. (At a recent visit to a planetarium, I was reminded of this phenomena in watching the stars picking up more mass as they get larger, sucking up the gravitationally weaker gas around them. Professor Pickney documents the same process in the present day economy.)While Tainter\u2019s argument can be read in support of less taxation generally, IMHO it should be more properly read as a warning against regressive taxation and over concentration of wealth.One final point on rationality, a key assumption made by Tainter. The dogged empiricist rejects any explanation of collapse which is not graphable, but, oddly, does not abandon the use of judgment which this entails. Here he is, dismissing as unreasonable a phenomenon that should be familiar to us:\u201cAs it becomes apparent to the members or administrators of a complex society that a resource base is deteriorating, it seems most reasonable to assume that some rational steps are taken toward a resolution. The alternative assumption\u2014of idleness in the face of disaster\u2014requires a leap of faith at which we may rightly hesitate.\u201dYes, it would seem reasonable to assume that rational steps are taken in the face of disaster, but self-interested humans are not always rational, and can be willfully blind to the threat of disaster. For example, did Germany under the Nazis act rationally? In 1932 and 1933 the German voters\u2019 immediate self-interest took priority over unthinkable long term outcomes. When did the Japanese leadership decide it had had enough? It was not following the March 1945 firebombing of Tokyo, which killed more civilians than the bombing of Hiroshima five months later. Did the wealthy members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club do the right thing and install a runoff valve after being warned of the design weaknesses of their dam by an engineer sent by the Johnston Iron Works? Nope. They did not want to spend the money, and hundreds of people downstream drowned or were crushed by the deluge. Heck, even solid, respected John Glenn did not believe Chris Kraft and team about the cause of the wing failures on the Chance Vought F8U, and instead continued to believe Chance Vought\u2019s company line. Does the continued failure in the United States government to regulate the production of greenhouse gases, having known about the phenomenon since the 1980s, appear rational? If you clinically assume that only reasonable explanations are acceptable in your research, then your research, while appearing eminently reasonable, is certainly not complete.Yet, despite this lacuna, Tainter concludes his study with this prescient question: \u201cWill we find, as have some past societies, that the cost of overcoming our problems is too high relative to the benefits conferred, and that not solving the problem is the economical option?\u201dThat certainly seems like the place we are headed. But, no matter, because, from an economist\u2019s viewpoint, collapse is just another word for \u201cadjustment to a level where outputs can again exceed inputs\u201d, much like \u201cnothing left to lose\u201d is just another word for freedom."], ["-1* for the painfully dry academic style, without a drop of liveliness or wit. -1* for not convincing me, assumptions, and ignoring evidence that did not support his position. Were I not typing this review out on a tablet, I might be more eloquent, but here's the gist of my reaction.Page 50, trying to refute resource depletion as a cause of collapse: \" As it becomes apparent to members or administrators of a complex society that a resource base is deteriorating, it seems most reasonable to assume that some rational steps are taken toward a resolution. The alternative assumption \u2013 of idleness in the face of disaster \u2013 requires a leap of faith at which we may rightly hesitate . \"Indeed it might be rational to do something, but look around you. We don't. We know oil is finite, yet we do little about it. We know in the USA that salinization of soil in California, where most of our produce is grown, is an increasing problem that will lead to starvation . We do nothing about it. We know that monoculture farming is a bad idea, yet we subsidize it. We know cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas are unsustainable because of lack of water, but we can't even bring ourselves to do some tiny thing like outlaw lawns, golf courses, or fountains in front of the casinos, much less write strict, sane zoning laws. We are, in short, fookin idiots. One would think we long for collapse, and the sooner, the better. Our motto may as well be \"idleness in the face of disaster.\"However , it was good to reconsider, reading his ideas, that \"collapse \" or the fall of a civilization likely is actually nothing worse than a decline, decentralization, collapse only of the elite, with the overtaxed working people basically taking their marbles and going home. He bemoans rich white guy art and literature disappearing , leading to a \"dark age\". However I would say that folk arts are every bit as good as \"high\" art, which gets defined as high only by the makers of it, after all. You'll never convince me Duchamp's urinal in a museum is vastly superior to an Appalachian woman's lovely quilt, sorry to say.Some of what he said let me to think of England in the last hundred years . Here's a nation that has \"collapsed\" by choosing to stop being an empire and instead become a stable small state, a lower form. It didn't hurt them at all, and its citizens are in many ways better off than I am. Therefore collapse can be good, and it needn't be feared."], ["This book seems to be the workhorse of the industrial-collapse intellectual set (Jared Diamond,Derrick Jensen,John Michael Greer, etc). It is a fairly straightforward, academic entry in the anthropological search for a grand theory to explain collapse. It is in this way a sort of counterpart to Earle and Johnson's The Evolution of Human Societies: From Foraging Group to Agrarian State, which advanced explanations for increases in social compexity and integration. Tainter begins by swiftly and often mercilessly batting aside all available explanations for collapse in the market at his time. (This perceived paucity seems to be his inspiration for the book.) These are, for the most part, very nicely done and quickly key in to the major flaws each theory has as an explanatory device. This clarity is extremely gratifying and I wish more thinkers would drink from Tainter's cup, so to speak. However, this incisiveness may come at the expense of nuanced, cautious, and case-specific history: Tainter is very much set on finding a 'global theory,' which can explain the recurring phenomenon of collapse found in any given place. He has no patience for theories that are overly dependent on the specific nature of each case, a trait that many historians and anthropologists would take issue with (cf. Questioning Collapse: Human Resilience, Ecological Vulnerability, and the Aftermath of Empire).After dispensing handily with the crowd of existing theories, Tainter offers his own suggestion: diminishing marginal returns (DMR). That is, any given strategy of social organization has large initial benefits that are easily obtained - this is why the transition occurs in the first place (as in Earle and Johnson). As time goes on, the most easily obtained benefits become the status quo, or are exhausted, or demand increases, forcing ever-higher costs to maintain the same level of growth/maintain stasis. This theory is handy in its versatility - it can apply to whatever the most fundamental resource of a society is, from soil nutrition to fisheries to information flow to technical development to oil. It works in tribal and chiefdom societies as well as state and industrial ones. It is so versatile, in fact, that I'm almost uncomfortable with it: based on the definitions offered in Earle and Johnson, and by Tainter himself, collapse is essentially synonymous with the cheapest strategy when costs of complexity begin to exceed benefits. DMR theory is thus uncomfortably tautological. As noted above, Tainter critiques other theories for being too parochial. His theory is so abstract and general, that in every application Tainter must call back the theories he eschewed and ask them to fill in the specifics of his theory, as subordinates to it.Tainter has nothing positive to say about the modern global situation. He concludes that, since the collapse of any one state would only result in its incorporation into a competitor, all the states must collapse at once if collapse does occur. He also sees no way out - with no new territory to conquer and no new energy subsidy to replace oil, the industrial lifestyle will outlive its value and be replaced by a more adaptive organization at some point (he wisely declines to say when he thinks this will happen). As an aside, John Michael Greer premises The Long Descent: A User's Guide to the End of the Industrial Age on the idea that, by Tainter's requirement that collapse occurs \"within a few decades,\" collapse is rare. Instead, societies tend to decline over a period of a century or more. This is a strange oversight in Tainter's book, since most of the examples of \"collapse\" he uses don't fit his own definition."], ["While on a trip to Peru I decided to tackle Joseph Tainter\u2019s The Collapse of Complex Societies. I learned of this book from Thomas Homer-Dixon\u2019s excellent The Upside of Down. Since we were once again headed to see some ruins, I thought this an appropriate time to approach this book, although in the case of the Incas, we can easily identify Guns, Germs, and Steel (and perhaps horses) as the proximate causes of collapse. But other cases, like the Maya, the Western Roman Empire, and Easter Island, are among those situations that do not provide easy explanations. Tainter reviews virtually all of the prevailing theories. He identifies the prevailing theory in popular thinking and among some historians (Toynbee, for instance) as \u201cmystical\u201d explanations, a poor choice of words to my mind. Toynbee, following a long pedigree, thinks in terms of biological analogies, with birth, youth, maturity, decline, and death the pattern for \u201ccivilizations\u201d as well as individuals. This, Tainter argues, provides a false and rather misleading or unhelpful analogy. The other theory, of \u201cdecadence\u201d, seems more literary and moral than causative. So what is Tainter\u2019s alternative? Declining marginal returns on complexity (complexity being a term of art in this instance). In short, he bases his theory upon a fundamental economic law (if you will suffer the dubious term here). His analysis and application of his theory to the Western Roman Empire argues that it was not barbarians, Christians, or plagues that brought down Rome, but a limitation on the value of complexity. He applies a similar analysis to the Mayans and the Chaco Canyon civilization in North America. If he\u2019s right, and I think that he makes a very strong argument (but see Peter Turchin\u2019s War and Peace and War for an excellent competing theory), it has to be taken quite seriously, and if he\u2019s right, then we have to think very carefully about our current predicament. Can we innovate our way out of the inevitable decline of petroleum? Can we get out from under excessive demands for complexity? On a second reading, even better! A very thorough, careful analysis of phenomena that we have to take most seriously. Outstanding achievement."], ["What was useful to me:I. The work provides a concise list of common threats to any organized large-scale social entity.II. Tainter makes the terminological distinction between 'Civilizations' and 'Complex-Societies'. He does this in order avoid any value-laden connotations. What is interesting, however, is that by adopting the term \"complex-society,\" he implies that the conceptual framework of the entity can apply to any organization that serves a social function, their sub-units, and larger systems composed thereby.III. In studying Tainter's work, one develops a teleological definition of the possibility of a \"civilization.\" A civilization can be materially considered a complex-society that functions as a problem-solving entity. It develops insofar as it is beneficial to the majority of its members. It begins to dissolve when it no longer benefits the majority of its populace.IV. Tainter's conceptual framework seems, without further analysis, to be closely in-line with Quigley's theories of historical analysis. In both works, the focus is more material than it is cultural. Quigley, though, gave more credence to cultural developments; probably as a useful indicator of the ideological state of the majority.V. A sizable portion of the text is dedicated to refuting \"mystical\" explanations of collapse. This is useful because it draws a very clear distinction between 'social criticism' and 'social science.' \"Mystical\" explanations of collapse make use of remarkably fuzzy notions of \"vigor\" and \"decadence\" and \"moral decay.\" Tainter may find them amusing, but he insists that we give them no time when we try to approach material problems of social significance: like a tax burden that does more harm to the foundational classes than benefit.VI. All problem solving organizations are subject to cost-benefit analysis. Complex socieities fail when they cost more to the majority than they benefit their well-being. It's a general, simple, and terribly demystifying approach to social organizations. It is similar to Quigley's distinction between 'social instruments' and 'institutions:' instruments are useful/ institutions are previously useful instruments that have become ossified and more ornamental than functional. Quigley has his own list of consequence to institutions. Reform is the happiest.VII. Our current global situation is too interconnected for individual complex-societies to collapse in isolation. Either they will be bailed out or invaded. If a collapse happens, it can only be global and catastrophic on a scale previously unseen by humanity. VIII. Competing Peer PolitiesIX.

Mentre la fiction \u00e8 come dipingere, acquerelli, pennellate che anche se cancellate e riscritte rimangono in trasparenza.In queste pagine non c\u2019\u00e8 inizio, e neppure finale: in mezzo ci sono tante storie, e c\u2019\u00e8 la storia di Joan. Fino al punto di raccontare i giorni passati a letto con malditesta micidiali, l\u2019emicrania che la tortura sin da piccola, le cefalee, i test che ha fatto in una clinica psichiatrica di Santa Monica, il referto finale.Scrivere della realt\u00e0, un po\u2019 della politica, soprattutto della cronaca, della vita sociale, dei costumi, delle cose di tutti i giorni - farlo con fantasia intelligenza acume e ironia, curando moltissimo lo stile - mettere tanto di s\u00e9, la propria personalit\u00e0 e anche la propria vita, i propri gusti e disgusti. Perch\u00e9 da bambina voleva fare l\u2019attrice, e poi cap\u00ec che scrivere \u00e8 un tipo di recitazione, e cio\u00e8 mostrarsi a un pubblico di lettori per pronunciare battute, solo che il dialogo \u00e8 tuo e non scritto da qualcun altro, solo che stai interpretando te stessa e non un qualche personaggio.Al Pacino in \u201cPanico a Needle Park\u201d di Jerry Schatzberg, 1971, uno dei film sceneggiati da Joan Didion insieme al marito John Dunne.

I don't know anything about the cathedral or the park except that it's the name and setting for one of my all-time favorite songs. My love for Mark Kozelek and the Red House Painters is marred a bit by what an asshole he was when I saw Red House Painters live. How does someone write such great songs and act like such a monumental douche (which apparently is his normal live persona, he yells at the audience, plays rambling things that can only be roughly called songs, yells at the audience some more, makes fun of individuals in the audience, plays some more rambling 'songs', continues this for hours on end). This book is sort of an extended tribute to a time and place I know almost nothing about first hand. 1960's. California. She is such an amazing writer that I found myself captivated by almost every essay in this book, even if I wasn't really interested in the subject matter. This is a magical skill great writers have. It's easy to find an essay interesting if you are already interested in a topic, but it takes great skill to make a topic the reader is not interested in to come alive by the writing. Why read about places, people and things so far distant from oneself though?In the big scheme of things why waste even a few minutes reading about the disastrous schemes of diamond lanes on the LA freeways in the 1970's, or about how the water is moved from Colorado River, across the Mojave desert to allow habitation in Malibu? Even if the writing is beautiful and honest, even if it is filled with self-confessional sentiments about the authors own enthrallment about the way water is moved, even if the writing is so good it just makes you ache in your bones, why waste any time reading about things so utterly alien to myself. It's not because I need water to survive, or because at times my life is maybe affected by decisions of urban planners into the way to divert traffic for one reason or another (which may not be to actually get traffic to move faster), my life is not pragmatically changed one bit by knowing anything I learned in these essays. Wouldn't I do better to read a turgidly written article on how to invest money wisely or a book on how to make and cultivate contacts or how to prioritize and maximize, and how to be a more productive person. How to be happier. Make more money. How to seduce women, maybe? How to present a better more presentable me? Or maybe read the ephemera of daily news. Catch up on celebrity gossip. Find out what exactly a Teen Mom is, learn about the real housewives and harness this knowledge into being a more likable person who can join in on break room conversations instead of being a sullenly glaring at all the people making too much noise while I'm trying to get to the bottom of the the nature of violence in modern man, the decline of western civilization, why authors kill themselves, or how Doris Lessing is a writer who fails at really capturing what she sets out to do. Why should I care about Doris Lessing, I've never even read one of her books, but the essay in The White Album still captivated me, but couldn't I have spent the twenty minutes or whatever it took me to read it doing something more productive? Maybe I could have been dashing out emails on my phone to people who I never get around to emailing. Or maybe a list of things I need to do and mean to do but instead I put off, procrastinate about, in favor of reading more books like this one that maybe enrich a part of my internal dialogue but can't put any quantifiable value on. Maybe instead of aiming to read over two hundred books a year I could aim to bring home 200k, or bed two hundred women, or make two hundred new facebook contacts that will pay off by adding to some kind of social network.This book didn't make me any better of a person than I was before I read it. It didn't add anything tangible to my life, it's not going to pay off in some way that I can hold up and show to anyone. If anything it is just another example of a great writer that I can read and then think, I'll never be able to write this well. I'll never be able to capture anything in my life, even the really important stuff like Joan Didion does for the most trivial of encounters. This book (and just about every other book I read) won't give me anything tangible, but fuck it, her writing is such a joy to read that the pleasure of reading so well-crafted prose is a reward in itself. Maybe I should feel sorry for other people who don't get to experience things like this in their life. Their loss."], ["If I had started with The White Album instead of Slouching Toward Bethlehem I might have been spared two years of blithely embarrassing myself with statements like: \u201cJoan Didion? She\u2019s ok.\u201d Actually she\u2019s amazing. The rhythms of her self-dramatization in Slouching were too arch for my taste, or perhaps for my mood. The White Album must be different, or I must have changed, because I love the persona that emerges from its rhythms. She\u2019s brooding, migrainous, in the first essay paranoid, yet essentially tough-minded and clear-seeing\u2014a recipe, of sorts, for my favorite type of writer. Baudelaire and Cioran also brazed their delicate nerves to hard, cutting styles. I like her excitability, her habit of sudden absorption. Of late \u201860s biker grindhouse she writes, \u201cI saw nine of them recently, saw the first one almost by accident and the rest of them with a notebook.\u201d The book\u2019s keynote, right there. Didion takes the stuff of recondite hobbies and autistic fixation\u2014irrigation infrastructure, the Governors\u2019 mansions of California\u2014and finds the grandeur, the lyric, the idea.Since the afternoon in 1967 when I first saw the Hoover Dam, its image has never been entirely absent from my inner eye. I will be talking to someone in Los Angeles, say, or New York, and suddenly the dam will materialize, its pristine concave face gleaming against the harsh rusts and taupes and mauves of that rock canyon hundreds and thousands of miles from where I am. I will be driving down Sunset Boulevard, about to enter a freeway, and abruptly those transmission towers will appear before me, canted vertiginously over the tailrace. Sometimes I am confronted by the intakes and sometimes by the shadow of the heavy cable that spans the canyon and sometimes by the ominous outlets to unused spillways, black in the lunar clarity of the desert night. Quite often I hear the turbines\u2026I walked across the marble star map that traces a sidereal revolution of the equinox and fixes forever, the Reclamation man had told me, for all time and for all people who can read the stars, the date the dam was dedicated. The star map, he had said, was for when we were all gone and the dam was left. I had not thought much of it when he said it, but I thought of it then, with the wind whining and the sun dropping behind a mesa with the finality of a sunset in space. Of course that was the image I had seen always, seen it without quite realizing what I saw, a dynamo finally free of man, splendid at last in its complete isolation, transmitting power and releasing water to a world where no one is.And leave it to the poet of Public Works to hang out with Malibu lifeguards and delight in \u201cthe laconic routines and paramilitary rankings\u201d of those \u201ccivil servants in red trunks,\u201d cherish their use of \u201ca diction as flat and as finally poetic as that of Houston Control.\u201d The White Album is rich in another effect, one I cannot name and so will clumsily indicate by invoking Holly\u2019s stereopticon in Badlands, Joseph Cornell\u2019s doll coffins among other uncanny capsules of ephemera; also, your mom\u2019s tasseled dance card, and Flaubert\u2019s assertion that \u201cwhen everything is dead, the imagination will rebuild entire worlds from a few elderflower twigs and the shards of a chamber-pot\u201d: The bedrooms are big and private and high-ceilinged and they do not open on the swimming pool and one can imagine reading in them, or writing a book, or closing the door and crying until dinner. The bathrooms are big and airy and they do not have bidets but they do have room for hampers, and dressing tables, and chairs on which to sit and read a story to a child in the bathtub. (\u201cMany Mansions\u201d)She was a child on the Wisconsin prairie who played with china dolls and painted watercolors with cloudy skies because sunlight was too hard to paint and, with her brothers and sisters, listened every night to her mother read stories of the Wild West, of Texas, of Kit Carson and Billy the Kid. She told adults that she wanted to be an artist and was embarrassed when they asked what kind of artist she wanted to be: she had no idea \u201cwhat kind.\u201d She had no idea what artists did. She had never seen a picture that interested her: other than a pen-and-ink Maid of Athens in one of her mother\u2019s books, some Mother Goose illustrations printed on cloth, a tablet cover that showed a little girl with pink roses, and the painting of Arabs on horseback that hung in her grandmother\u2019s parlor.(\u201cGeorgia O\u2019Keeffe\u201d)"], ["Reading Didion\u2019s essays is not unlike unearthing a time capsule you didn\u2019t know existed from a parallel universe that appears earthlike. Sure, there are words like California and feminism and Malibu \u2013 but Didion does things to those familiar events and locales that changes them into an unique vision, a Didionism. Whether we\u2019re standing with her on Oak Street below the Black Panthers\u2019 HQ receiving a visual pat-down, retracing author James Jones\u2019 steps along the army barracks in Honolulu or mesmerized by the flashing lights of a California water station \u2013 we are viewing the world in a clarity that only she can properly express. To brook an opposing view is an impossibility; it would shatter the magic and render the vibrant hue of the Didion world into workaday memories, pale, gray and dimensional as news viewed on library microfiche."], ["I didn\u2019t love these essays until about the midpoint, \u201cThe Women\u2019s Movement\u201d, a devastatingly good piece about the watering-down of feminism in mid-century America, about the heartbreaking shift of a vitally important revolutionary movement as it lost touch with its ideological base and became ever more a vehicle appropriated by a leisure class, its goals moving away from seeking the possibility for an individual to create their own unique destiny unfettered by traditional obstacles and bias, and moving toward something like a seeking of the possibility for the mere prolongation of adolescence, a fear of growing up- more a form of escapism than a new form of liberation. This seems to me, even today, a very important and accurate assessment of not only what happened within various egalitarian movements in the last half of the 20th century, but a shift that occurred on whole societal, generational levels in America.After that midpoint in the book, pretty much every essay contains little revelations, little personal thunderstorms and continental illuminations. Didion does such a great job of balancing the internal and the external, the personal and the social, the personal and the political. Her cultural criticisms are downright measured but no less defanged (such intelligence and confidence need not be blustery), and what I find at the heart of many of the cultural and political essays is a distanced lamentation for an America that could have been but was lost or obliterated at some vague point in the latter days of the 60\u2019s; could have been if we were less forgetful of history, less willing to take the path of least resistance, less entitled, less ready to meet our better selves, less easily resigned to things as they come packaged. She rarely seems angry; she often seems disappointed. Her prose is never shaken (this woman can write a hell of a balanced, beautiful sentence), but what we are given as her personality often seems on the verge of tearing in the winds of her times.Speaking of, wind is an important element in this collection. Wind blows from the Pacific through an open hotel room window as she anticipates a tidal wave and a possible divorce in Honolulu. Wind stirs up debris in the streets of Bogota. Wind blows and stokes fires across southern California that heat to such an extreme that birds explode in mid-air. Wind ripples the surface of the ocean as she observers a diver submerging into cold water thick with kelp. Wind has aided the coastal fires in coating the surface of the water with soot. The elements are ever present and interactive. Water nourishes Amado Vazquez\u2019s thousands of orchids before fire destroys them. Light and water on the beaches of California and Hawaii coddle the idle survivors of old money. She is a great observer of rain, rain and its antithesis, dust. Water holds special sway over her recollections; the flow of water and the absence of water; water held back by dams, flow stations, the control and release of water- as it would anyone living in the arid southwest or California\u2019s strange meteorological zones. Light, the viscosity of air in certain places, the various colors of vegetation and vegetation\u2019s abundance or lack, even a person's voice or posture, their slightest motion- Didion is so conscious of the tone of a setting and the settings constituent pieces, be it a forest or an airport, a hotel room in New York or student demonstration, a stretch of coast or a shopping mall, the Hoover Dam or the Getty Museum. She is a master at uncovering the telling detail of a scene, and this includes the obscure detail ferreted out that in brief is revelatory of someone or something's broader historicity.Her voice is always re-centering in the human, the cultural, the societal- the orientation of the individual in respect to the massive undulations of the country and the epoch. A military graveyard attendant. Soldiers. Lifeguards. Botanists. Filmmakers. Painters. Writers. Politician\u2019s wives. Radical activists. Murderers. Musicians. That she can project a totality of all of these things, and get at the heart of ideas that define a very specific time and place (California, USA, 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s), and at the same time write it so that we feel that we have been allowed a purview of not only that era but of the intimate space where it touched a specific woman\u2019s memory, is impressive indeed."], ["As was the case with Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem, certain aspects of The White Album seem hopelessly dated. I have no idea who Bishop James Pike is, for instance, and now that I've read about him I still don't really care. But another aspect of this collection irked me even more: Didion's all-encompassing weariness, her mild derision for seemingly everything and everyone with whom she crosses paths. Even in her younger years, did Joan Didion ever get excited about anything, ever, even things she loved? Seemingly not. But in this book we also learn some personal things about Joan Didion: Over the years these essays encompass, she is admitted to a psychiatric hospital for what looks to be a combination of depression and anxiety. Her marriage seems to be on shaky ground. She gets crippling migraines at least once a week. She is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a fact that is mentioned once and never again. I was reminded of Didion's novel Play It as It Lays--a favorite of mine--wherein the protagonist experiences her fair share of trauma and copes with it by withdrawing, a numbness and lack of affect substituting for the more expressive human emotions. It's pretty clear Joan Didion is never going to show you her whole hand, but it's a good bet she's concealing something major. So for me, the net effect of reading Didion's essays is a burning curiosity about Didion herself. To the extent that it's possible, I'm going to start satisfying that curiosity posthaste."], ["I enjoyed this dystopian look at a far future California under attack:\u201cthe \u201crescue-boat operation\u201d at Paradise Cove, the \u201cbeach operations\u201d at Leo Carrillo, Nicholas, Point Dume, Corral, Malibu Surfrider, Malibu Lagoon, Las Tunas, Topanga North and Topanga South.

And then, during the year's last handful of blessedly slow days at the Crappiest Place on Earth, I discovered that actually taking my lunch hour to hunker shoelessly down in the backseat of my car with a blanket and a book is pretty much the best thing to ever happen to my sanity professional life. Observe the photographic proof of my sublime on-the-clock refuge:\n(Thank bouncing Baby Jesus that Fari\u00f1a's Cornell chum desensitized me to complex equations interrupting literature.)So now a novel that was published two days before its author's far-too-early death has found an even fonder association in my own personal landscape, thanks to my unyielding dissatisfaction with and need to escape from a job that takes me farther and farther from where I wanted to be at this point in my life. I am so glad that I read this book now, rather than as a starry-eyed undergrad with dreams of running the NYT and writing The Greatest American Novel of My Generation on the side. I have a better sense of how life is not something that can be planned for, that growing up is fucking hard even with a willingness to let one's inner child have a say every now and again, that death is always lurking around every corner, and coming to this novel without even one of those hard lessons under my belt would have reduced this from a poignantly frenzied love song of youth's last discoveries to an instruction manual for college kids who just want to shake things up (not that there's anything inherently wrong with living in the moment and taking inconsequentially stupid chances, for those are the backbone of the best Hey, Remember When...? tales). I absolutely would have embraced any opportunity to cause a scene at a formal frathouse dinner like Gnossos Pappadopoulis (Fari\u00f1a's thinly veiled stand-in for himself) did, just as I had also proclaimed myself in love with wrong guy after wrong guy based on a series of limited-engagement liaisons, as Gnossos did with Kristin, his obsession in green knee-socks and loafers.My tendency to relate too personally with literary characters came out to play for keeps as Gnossos became a clearer and clearer picture; save for a few lapses into first-person narration, this is a story told mostly in third-person with a focus on GP, so it takes some time to get a sense of his motivation and how others perceive him (it takes a little longer to reconcile the two seemingly at-odds realities). And perhaps I was imposing my own inner workings on Gnossos but I left this book with a sense of awed kinship inspired by his mostly successful attempts to hide his soft heart under an ornery facade. He wants to feel, he wants to live, he wants to be earnest in his devil-may-care approach to throwing himself into living but he is woefully, painfully afraid of doing so because fully embracing life means also acknowledging that death is the inevitable end game.Gnossos seems like the kind of maniac ringleader whose enthusiasm and passion attract unresisting friends and followers in droves but his attitude obscures a desperate desire to fall in love rather than indulge in a series of unemotional physical encounters, which is what it seems will finally help him stop fighting thanathos with an unequivocally driving life force. Had I not read Pynchon's \"Entropy\" in college, I would have probably missed the significance of how Gnossos has hermetically sealed himself inside every room he occupies in an attempt to artificially preserve life against the natural encroachment of death -- until his night with Kristin has him throwing open windows with the zeal of a man possessed. He is a character who fights the unpleasant reality with the much more pleasing act of losing oneself in the moment and clinging to that happiness as if that's all it takes to preserve that joy for eternity. As his attempts at pleasant stasis become more desperate and he loses control over situations that initially plopped him on top of the world, it becomes more obvious that this is a guy who wants freedom without responsibility -- and, in the end, isn't that what college is all about?It's Bukowski once you've swapped the booze for drugs. It's Hunter S. Thompson with an overt awareness that death is nipping at his heels. It's Kerouac as a college kid. It's Pynchon with narrative restraint. But most of all, it's both proof that Fari\u00f1a's early death was a huge loss to the literary world and a tribute to a screamingly talented artist who knew how to find the biggest truths in the smallest moments while laughing and kicking death in the ass. Because as much as Gnossos (and, presumably, Fari\u00f1a) feared death, his ability to suck the marrow from every moment is the ultimate victory of life."], ["Smirky superior hectoring hipster cultivates cringemaking condescension, bullying braggadocio and sexual sneering in wearisome war on straight society. I really would have liked our protohippy hero Gnossos Pappadopoulis to die of a drug overdose around page seven but he didn\u2019t. Could be Gnossos is actually Holden Caulfield on acid. That would account for my immediate and total hatred of him."], ["Richard Farina is something of a role model to me. If I could model my life after his I would - all except the dying in a motorcycle accident two days after my first novel is published. But besides this I would like to:1. release acoustic driven music with my beautiful girlfriend/wife2. Publish a novel centered around a smooth-talking, fast-living, drug-ingesting protagonist named Gnossos (yes, that's right his name is Gnossos and you don't even wanna know his last name)3. Participate in campus demonstrations against draconian campus policies.and 4. Be Thomas Pynchon's best friend and have Gravity's Rainbow dedicated to me; I mean how fuckin' cool would that be.But all personal coolness aside, \"Been Down So Long..\" is actually a good novel. While a bit dated (as this was written in the sixties), and a bit misogynistic (he lies about using a contraceptive just so he can get some), the novel is buzzing in style, dripping in a sixties coolness and an extemporaneous desire for change. Gnossos, while sometimes loathsome, is also entertaining to be around. This is not a novel I would recommend to most women; they might like it if they are into Bukowski or something similar, but most probably will not. I think I like the novel more than I think it is actually good. When I picked it up the title struck me as something so modern, like the title of some indie rock band's second album, and when I read the first chapter it was written with such verve and humour that it immediately had me hooked. More so than that the ending threw me for a loop and showed me that this was more than an \"On The Road\" wanderlust excuse to drink and take drugs (although there is a rather large element of that) But more so it was about the effects of trying to maintain a detached cool in the midst of so much cultural change; and even more universal than that, it's about trying to go through life and never be embarrased or made foolish, and only portray the most laid-back, witty, and insouciant calm that no real person actually has. And, of course, anyone who drinks, takes drugs, lies and sleeps around is the complete opposite of these things; he's an insecure man who has been down so long that it starts looking like up."], ["before Picking this up seems like a very logical progression from Stone Junction: both mystical journeys, both introduced by Thomas Pynchon, both books I remember loving a decade ago but don't really remember. I'm a little nervous re-reading this, because it shines in my mind as one of the best things I ever read, and I certainly don't want to prove that untrue. But I'm sure it's as amazing as I remember it, right? Right????after Spoiler: wrong.This past summer I went to a \"Summer of Love\" exhibit at MoMA. Let me just make it clear that I was raised by hippies and even lived on a hippie farm for the first few years of my life; Grateful Dead was my favorite band until I was 13, and I still compost every single carrot peel and eggshell, even though it means schlepping a gross drippy bag of rotting fruit bits on the subway twice a week. So yeah, I obviously went to the \"Summer of Love\" exhibit at MoMA with very high hopes.Turned out I actually found it really confusing and depressing. Not because the art was bad; it was great. But all the \"trippy\" neon and psychedelic tie-dye and black-lit swirls just felt so silly to me, so overdone and clich\u00e9d and kind of pathetic. But here's the thing: none of that stuff was clich\u00e9d. It's just that every freaking thing that's been done since ripped it off, reducing and devaluing it all by sheer oversaturation into something cloying and mass marketed and hokey. And so it is with Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me. I know that in the '50s when this was written, the jargon, the attire, the struggles and quests were groundbreaking and awe-inspiring and amazing. But now... it's just been copied ad nauseum, more and more reductively and simplistically each time, by so many awful wannabes, that the whole thing feels stale, a little clunky, a little sad. And so oh la. This is still an amazing book, but in a crushing blow I've had to demote it from my \"perennial favorites\" shelf to \"formative reading.\" I mean, this book had a dramatic effect on me as a teenager, but -- though it grieves me to admit -- it just didn't blow my mind as a semi-adult. For those who've never read it, it's absolutely worth a look, as long as you're prepared to be kind to it, and meet it on its own terms: serious psychedelica, spirit quests, campus unrest, an inevitable road trip to Cuba, and lots and lots and lots of drugs."], ["Well, if you ever want proof of how sixties totems don't really age well, this is the book for you. The cult following has been long if somewhat subterranean, its duration due in part to the unfortunate circumstance of its author dying in a motorcycle accident only a couple dozen hours after its publication (and only a few months before the mythological motorcycle accident of Farina's \"brother-in-law,\" Bob Dylan). It also helps your literary endurance to have gone to Cornell with both Thomas Pynchon and C. Michael Curtis of Atlantic Monthly fame. Readers will be forgiven for wondering, in fact, if Pynchon didn't have a hand in the book since its manic energy and style are simpatico to both V and The Crying of Lot 49. When I first read this the summer before I went to college (right after the edition with Farina's face on it came out---the new edition with the upside down crotch shot doesn't do much to sell the legend) there were even rumors that Pynchon WAS Farina, or Farina WAS Pynchon. Or something like that. In the end, reading the book is a lot like watching WILD IN THE STREETS or maybe even VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS (best scene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy40TT... thanks, MST3K): it's best enjoyed with tongue in cheek. Maybe in the end the important thing this book documents is how the youth rebellion associated with the sixties had a hard time rising about juvenility. (Suffice to say that a moral stand in this plot revolves around flipping off the evil campus VP). All that said, you can still watch clips of the Berkeley Free Speech days and appreciate why aggressive generational politics was necessary back in the day: old people really acted like mean old people before 1966. Nobody above 25 gave two shits about being cool or hip. So the book really captures the late 50s period when weed, premarital sex, and long hair were indeed considered threats to the social order. That makes for an interesting if not always sympathetic document. As many commentators have remarked, rebellion here is a boys club---you can draw a straight line from the humor to Animal House and realize frattiness was in the blood even if you were vehemently anti-frat. Anyway, worth a gander for nostalgia's sake. Farina's musical career is actually more emotionally engaging if you aren't put off by the sort of folk music that prefers dulcimers to acoustic blues noodling and has titles like \"Reflections in a Crystal Wind.\" Personally, I dig it, baby. RF's wife was the gorgeous and highly underestimated Mimi Farina (Joan baez's kid sister). She survived her husband by thirty-five years but still died way too young, nearly a decade ago now."], ["When I read that Pynchon was best buds with Fari\u00f1a and that this novel had a setting at Cornell, I was interested. However much Pynchon loved the guy, this is not particularly good writing. Think the drugs are a little harder to work around for some folks.

Yes, it's trippy, but it's also sexist as hell, sensationalist, and extremely pretentious -- in both style and matter. It's counter-culture in all the stupid ways -- oooh, drug-taking is awesommmmeeee man -- and not critical of the protagonist, whose name actually means \"knowledge,\" as he acts on the same base prejudices that make mainstream culture so rotten. A hands-down trash book."], ["This is my hands-down, desert-island favorite novel, and like all favorite novels, my own adoration is rooted in such particular tastes I understand why very few of my friends like the book. Farina was a successful folk musician, playing with his wife Mimi Baez and touring with Bob Dylan and her sister Joan in the 60s. The Cuban-Irish author was also a published poet, and wasn't known for his fiction until this novel, his first and last. Three days after its publication, Farina was killed in a motorcycle crash.This novel stands on its own even without the coincidental pedigree of its author (friends with Pynchon at Cornell). Essentially a 60s campus novel set at a veiled Cornell in the 50s, our perspective is a unique third-person limited omniscience written in the same tone and voice of the protagonist, Greek itinerant Gnossos Pappadopolis. There's a level of farcical allusion and playful lyricism that put off many readers, but rewards close reading. It allows Farina to encapsulate a wide range of topics without appearing false: the youthful hubris of immortality, here called Immunity; the naive spirit of protest and general counterculture billowing on campuses nationwide in the Age of Aquarius; the outside world, a place of spurious rules and authority figures best ignored as long as possible; and even, despite the protective bubble of the college setting, real consequence and sadness. Farina tackles almost every American issue in this beguiling text, all through the eyes of one of Kerouac's \"mad ones.\" Of course, the bubble of Immunity pops in the end, grounding the book in a reality all too familiar for 60s children. The journey there, with its unforgettable characters and set pieces (and that language!), is one I take at least once every year."], ["I read this in the late sixties and wasn't impressed back then. I first experienced Richard Farina as a mediocre singer and songwriter, and his fiction writing fell into the same category. I guess that much of his reputation rests on his good looks and his early death in a motorcycle accident - also his friendship with Thomas Pynchon. None of which has anything to do with good writing.I have no desire to reread this.

At the end, he also talks about some present-day cases where we still don't know what will happen. The one my thoughts keep returning to is medieval Greenland, which Diamond discusses in a long and detailed chapter. Settled in the 11th century by Vikings originally from Norway, the colonists brought with them their whole way of life, which was heavily organized around dairy farming. There is an eerie description of a huge barn with room for 80 head of cattle; the ruins can still be seen today. The colony survived for several hundred years, and was then wiped out to the last man by worsening weather and the decline in the European market for narwhale ivory.But here's the really odd thing. The colonists never ate fish, despite the fact that it formed the staple diet of the indigenous Greenland Eskimos. Diamond says that every single archaeologist who's studied the settlement starts off convinced that there must have been some kind of mistake. How is it possible that these hardy, intelligent people could have failed to adapt their diet in such an obvious way? But the evidence from middens is apparently rock-solid. For whatever reason, they would not make use of this plentiful natural resource, which could easily have saved them; they perished instead.Incomprehensible, isn't it? Needless to say, our own society's reluctance to invest more than a token amount of money in developing cheap solar power is different. The two cases are in no way comparable.____________________________Just back from Australia, where I had several illuminating discussions with various people about solar energy. Australia is almost certainly the country where it would work best. Population density is very low, and there is abundant sunlight. The technology already exists to build cheap solar power stations.So why don't they do it? Apparently, building the power stations in desert areas isn't economically viable unless national resources are diverted to connect them to the national grid. But the powerful coal lobby hates the idea, and has blocked it at every turn. Neither left-wing nor right-wing politicians dare oppose them.You often see individuals doing this kind of thing: even though a given course of action is evidently going to benefit them (leave their abusive partner, stop binge-drinking), they are unable to summon the willpower to quit. It's interesting and remarkable that whole societies exhibit the same behavior.____________________________As previously noted. Tony Abbott is really doing everything he can to consolidate his position as the new Dubya."], ["Fascinating work by the same author who won a Pulitzer prize for Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. This exhaustive study in Malthusian economics as applied to several societies in history that have failed, such as the Easter Islanders and Greenland Norse, details the thematic traits common to each example. His chapter on Easter Island made me think of Thor Heyerdahl's work there.Most notably is how deforestation and imprudent population control applies to modern societies in trouble as well. I find myself thinking about this work frequently, his ideas resonate with our times, mirroring as they do, and as he shows us, with failed societies of the past. Haunting and thought provoking and a damn fine book."], ["The Pulitzer-prize winning \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" by this dude forever changed the way I look at history. And believe me, I am a history buff of sorts so this means a lot. Unfortunately, \"Collapse\" fails to measure up to that classic.The real problem with Collapse isn't the research that goes into the thesis, or even the soundness of the thesis itself (though there are some qualms I have about how politically unstable Mongolia is or basing his analysis of cod fisheries on a single popular accunt). The central contention, that population explosion, interdependency, unsustainable harvest, adverse cultural values, and about 8 other factors contributed to a society's collapse, is innocuous enough, though admittedly somewhat vague. Rather, the problem is that Diamond is so intent upon clearly and explicitly detailing every freaking argument to paint a convincing picture of the ancient/medieval societies or the current polluting industries that he often loses sight of his larger arguments. For instance, his discussion of Viking Greenland v. Iceland is insightful but whether it warrants nearly 100 pages in a 500 page book I doubt. The same could be said of his discussion of modern Australia; China, in contrast, gets really short shrift. He goes at pain to explicate the archaeological evidence by which we understand the Anasazi collapse, but here too he gets a little repetitive and locquacious. For instance, the logic behind dendrochronolgy and salinization were explained more than once to elucidate yet another nuance. Indeed, here Diamond the scientist persistently gets in the way of Diamond the popular writer. Were it not for his stellar writing skills this would have been even more of a chore to read.Apart from the lack of effective editing, Collapse suffers from Diamond's penchant to almost bend over backward to point out that he is not engaged in a crude form of \"Environmental determinism\" whereby the significance of cultural and political events are misleadingly downplayed. He certainly didn't do this in Guns Germs and Steel but many people, including the NY Times, accuse him of it. Nevertheless Diamond was sufficiently sensitive to this interpretation (as well as eager to show that we can prevent environmental catastrophe) that he repeats this ad nauseum and, IMHO, belabors this point to being beyond repetitive. The cumulative effect of all these shortcomings is that the book ends up presenting really rather very little that is new, argues persistently against straw man hypotheses, and is informative but almost in a trivial sense. At 520 odd dense pages this is a lot to ask of a reader, and it is a pity that this simply does not measure up to Diamond's earlier works."], ["This is a major work. Diamond looks in detail at the factors at play in the demise of civilizations in human history, using a wide range of examples. He offers a framework in which to structure the analysis and looks in great detail at possible (and in many cases certain) reasons why various societies collapsed. He is not a one-note analyst. All problems do not fit the same mold. There is considerable nuance and common sense brought to bear on this examination. Foolishness plays a part, greed, corruption. But just as frequently, the actors behave rationally. Maybe they were unaware or could not possibly be aware of the larger implications of their actions. Maybe the land in which they lived was ill-suited to large numbers of humans. Maybe changes in climate made what seemed a reasonable place a death trap. Clearly an analysis of why societies failed in the past, with particular attention to environmental issues, has direct relevance to our world today. For example, Polynesian islands that were dependant on resources from other islands collapsed when their import supply dried up. That has relevance to oil-dependant first world nations today, for example. Diamond goes out of his way to make a case that business is business and they are not in the business of performing charity or taking responsibility for the common weal. He does point out that some businesses have been instrumental in forcing improvements in producers. He cited Home Depot and BP among others, although I expect he might have second thoughts about the latter's net impact. I found the book to be extremely eye-opening and informative. It was a long, slow read, but well worth the effort. It makes my short list of must read for anyone seriously interested in current affairs."], ["I considered giving this book 4 instead of 5 stars simply because it can be over-dense in its detail and the style can be rather dry - but then I figured that says more about my stamina and laziness than about the quality of the book, so the book gets 5 and I get a 4 for effort. We're all winners.So despite the headline-grabbing title, the author Jared Diamond - a cross between an Amish garden gnome and avuncular Glastonbury festival supremo if you go by his picture - tries its darndest to avoid sensationalism, and the author opts instead for what is sorely needed in the environmental debate: sober, empirical analysis. But don't let that put you off - once you put your brain into the right gear this book can be completely consuming and fascinating, and the message and lessons it gives are electrifying.Diamond examines in turn a number of societies, ancient and modern, successful or unsuccessful, and forensically examines what were the factors in their collapse or survival before turning to our modern, global society to ask what lessons we can apply from those past cases to the predicament we face today. We learn about the Easter Islanders (about whom one of Diamond's pupils asked: \"What was going through the mind of the man who chopped down the last tree on the island?\"), the Anasazi, the Maya, the Greenland Norse and Greenland Inuit, modern day Australia and Montana, shogun-ruled Japan and others.He identifies common environmental problems which collapsed societies have tended to share (deforestation and soil erosion as well as resource depletion cropping up again and again), as well as cultural factors such as systems of government and contact with other societies. He cites some incredible studies such as the examination of ancient middens, of crystallised rodents' piss and of pond sediments to show how we can unravel the mysteries of some of these collapses by using the study of, for example, pollen in sediment or animal bones in middens to paint a vivid picture of climates, deforestation and diets at precise times in these societies' stories. It was this quite academic precision that gave me a quiet thrill and which gives this book its calm authority.Diamond ends by looking at our modern global society and assessing its chances of overcoming the sheer number, breadth, scale and interconnectedness of the ecological problems facing us, and although he insists he is an optimist - and argues that our globalised society gives us advantages in finding solutions as well as giving us zero escape routes if we fail - by the time you finish reading, you feel that as a planet we've got a sheer cliff face to climb, and his optimism sounds a little disingenuous. But educating yourself to understand these issues is a necessary step to doing your bit, and this book will certainly arm you with the sobering facts. If only the debate were always conducted in these civilised (in the best sense of the word) terms."], ["The halfway point review:One question I've been wrestling with as I read, as I watch these societies move slightly past sustainability, as I read about societal collapse and the squandering of resources by the wealthy and then the inevitable cannibalism that always seems to show up in the last act, I keep asking myself how the environment became a \"political issue.\" There's no question that environmental resources aren't infinite, yet it seems like the majority of people\u2026or at least the loudest faction\u2026care less about human life on earth than their own comfort and status. Or else, how can they justify placing jobs, business interests, or anything else ahead of the environment in their values?Is it because environmental damage is such a gradual process? If so, we need to come up with some way to drive home the importance of creating a sustainable way of living. Politicians hedging around environmental issues--while placing these issues on the same level of importance as gays in the military--is clearly not getting us anywhere. Literature on the dangers of global warming and about the human effects on the environment isn't going to get the point across to those who willfully avoid learning about the topic. Does the environmental movement need more advertisements? More celebrity endorsements? I hate asking rhetorical questions, even if my goal is to generate conversation, so my hypothesis, without any evidence to support it, is YES: we need a much fucking better PR department, and we need it quickly. If we are going to keep the global society from reaching the point of some real collapse, we need to change the rhetoric with which we talk about the \"environment.\" The environment is an abstract \"out there\" that doesn't necessarily include human babies or grandchildren. The way we abstractly think of \"the environment\" makes this separation of humans from their environment easier. We need rhetoric that makes it clear that when we speak of \"the environment,\" what we are really concerned with is the continued ability for humanity to survive on this planet. What we're talking about isn't separate from people, physically or ethically. I'll end my halfway point review by bringing up the personal guilt that reading these pages has reawakened in me. Reading about the way the Easter Islanders squandered resources building the tremendous statues and headpieces for the glorification of rich people has reminded me of my own complicity. I've always thought of myself as an environmentalist: I take the light-rail whenever possible, recycle, eat with an awareness of where my food comes from. But, even as someone passionate about the environment, I've spent several years working at a bank. I've spent my time too focused on my own education to dedicate much time to preservation\u2026which is what I'm complaining about others doing. What have I truly done to rebel against a society that places greed and opulence above sustainability? I've found ways to reduce the damage that I inflict, but I have done nothing to challenge my society's destructive way of being.

Impact of non-native speciesAnd now we face four more:9. Human-caused climate change10. The build up toxic waste11. We're approaching the limits of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity12. Energy shortagesThere are societies that failed to resolve these problems and they collapsed because of it. Perhaps the best example of this is Diamond's discussion of the isolated Polynesians on Easter Island. They used all of their trees, which led to soil erosion, which led to food shortages, which led to cannibalism. We now live in a \"globalized world,\" but perhaps we should say that we're finally realizing that we live on an island. It seems that we have yet to realize the demands we make on our island.(Is this a bad time to point out that NASA, which apparently costs less per year than the American military spends per year on air conditioning, retired its fleet this week?)I wish that I could just knock off one or two of those problems from Diamond's list, but I can't. Many of them are linked, so if we fail to respond to one, we fail to respond to several. At other times, we lean too hard on solving one problem and end up causing new problems. For example, many forests (Diamond refers to Montana, but I've read about this dynamic elsewhere) have been developed as cottage areas, so we do not allow fires or any logging. The buildup of old forest and underbrush makes for a tinderbox, which means that when fires do happen, they are massive. And putting them out is not free, either.How do you gather political will to deal with a problem like this? We could try to log sustainably and selectively, but what company can we trust to log in such a way? Sure, many companies will claim to do good, but we've been tricked before, haven't we? So the environmentalists are out. The cottage owners are certainly not going to recommend logging or allowing fires of any sort to threaten their investments. So basically, every stakeholder is stuck.Diamond quickly moves on from Montana and illustrates the role of ecological problems in societal collapses by comparing past societies that collapsed (as opposed to declined) throughout history. In each case, he methodically outlines how these societies destroyed themselves by failing to resolve ecological problems. It's pretty convincing, if you need convincing.I think there is a common concern for the environment. I'm not even 30, so perhaps I can't speak with a great deal of authority on the subject, but it feels to me that North America is obsessed with post-apocalyptic settings right now. If there is a \"spirit\" of a society that is translated in its literature, then I think it's safe to say that the bearded guy holding a \"the end is nigh\" sign is finally getting the mainstream audience he dreamed of.It seems to me the real problem is that it is very difficult to minimize our impact on the environment. We can call upon America to lead the way, but they can't even manage their debt. In fact, the societies that Diamond relies on to illustrate that it is possible to limit deforestation, tend to be autocratic (though so were the societies that Diamond relies on to illustrate failure). Now, some NGOs have set up certification procedures that identify wood that was harvested sustainably, but other corporate commissions have set up their own certification bodies to confuse consumers.Nevertheless, Diamond outlines reasons to be cautiously optimistic before concluding. Unfortunately, this may have been the least convincing part of Collapse.So I'll close with the cynical words of Danny Archer from Blood Diamond.\"When was the last time the world wasn't ending?\"Usually, I find these words very soothing. Now I feel like the world always has been ending. It's just that until recently, humanity could only end one specific part of it at any given time. Now we're a global society."], ["This is an exhaustive and exhausting read. Should\u2019ve been tightened up and trimmed down, not only did I get tired of the meandering but I got worn down from getting machine-gunned with an avalanche of what I considered often superfluous details. Still, I thought it was very good, the historical examples of collapse (and also the examples of societies that successfully changed to avoid disaster) were interesting. It put the contemporary analysis/problems we face in perspective. I remember reading Guns, Germs, Steel and while I enjoyed it Diamond's geographical determinism was tiresome and I suspect overplayed. In this book he focuses on environmental stresses and issues playing a role in collapsing societies. I think he does a good job in explaining the multitude of factors beyond this arena, so it isn\u2019t quite as one-tracked and only focused on environmental determinism. I think environment is crucial but it\u2019s important to add proper qualifiers and try to not overplay your thesis.My impression is anthropologists really seem to have an ax to grind with Diamond. Always interesting to see what people from certain fields have to say about popular books written about their domain (especially those books written by someone who isn\u2019t part of their tribe). I haven\u2019t read specific critiques of this book just remember some articles I\u2019ve seen where anthropologists have absolutely smashed Diamond for his other work. I imagine some of their critique is right but it seems overly harsh, a bit overdone leading me to wonder if they aren\u2019t just trying to protect their turf. Anyhow, I\u2019m sure in such a huge book as this one, covering so much material, Diamond made some missteps but I think his overall thesis is ballpark correct (and important!) and the general historical analysis strikes me as solid. Given the interwoven nature of the global economy, intricate complexity of our systems, and rates of environmental destruction and pressures we are applying on environment Diamond readily admits we are facing huge, potentially civilization changing downshifts. Grave risks, weakness or breakdown in one part of the global system can reverberate throughout. So it was kind of jarring to me when he states at the end of his book that he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d we can turn things around in regards to preventing environmental breakdowns and catastrophes for global civilization. I was a bit surprised by that tbh, maybe I was struck by the nonchalance of his optimism especially given his devastating analysis of what we are facing. I\u2019m certainly not as sanguine. I always kind of hope that hey, maybe I\u2019ve just drank too much of that Jonestown Climate Change/Environmental Apocalypse kool-aid ha. Would love to be magnificently wrong on everything but I\u2019d rather try and see things as they are than try and lie to myself with beautiful illusions. I\u2019m just a lay person, but my sense given what I\u2019ve read is that we are in big trouble and courting a slowly unfurling disaster. There were some great sections. I liked the one where he spells out something like a list of 10 reasons/statements people use to minimize environmental problems. This includes people who have magical belief in deux ex machina future tech that will come save us from problems we have or are causing. I\u2019m glad he hates this because I hate it, it really drives me bonkers, the use of this concept is a great way to sidestep any responsibility or accountability for present actions and greenlights continuation of pernicious status quo. I do think tech and innovation can be tools to help us, but they all have various externalities and can cause new problems of their own, plus in regards to environment, since the systems are all so interconnected you destroy or damage one aspect it can lead to a grand cascade. At that point tech can maybe help minimize issues but it is hard (impossible?) if damage is too great the unleashed cascade will shudder throughout the systems. Good luck putting the genie back in the bottle, some changes are irrevocable (6th extinction underway is a good example, even the destruction of what can seem an innocuous tiny microorgamisn can completely change the ecosystem with implications for species in that system). Diamond also points out another argument people use to justify environmental destruction: well the environment is a luxury and we need to do everything we can for our economy (which includes destroying the environment). The economy is driven by the environment! you break the environment (or elements of it) and you will likely hamstring your economy in various ways. Happens again and again. And it's not simple, I understand the tension in this dynamic because if you are hungry today you need to do whatever it is you can to put food on the table and sometimes that includes destroying the environment which will have long term implications, but if you are hungry and desperate you don't have as much luxury to think about or emphasize the long term. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about his soft defense of corporations and his emphasis on the consumer. I think it annoys me, lol. He doesn\u2019t give corporations a free pass, but he tries to explain why they do what they do. He tries to play a balanced view on all this, hey corporations have to operate under their prime directive (PROFITS! at all costs) or they will be sued by shareholders if they don\u2019t (regardless of damage done to environment, community, etc). He also very much emphasizes consumer ability to exert pressure on companies to shift to more environmentally friendly habits. I believe this is a good tactic but can also be limited (not to mention not all consumers have luxury to shift to more environmentally friendly consumption nor the luxury of time to research and learn what those options might be). Ultimately I am of the belief one has to reform the systems we are operating in, this includes reforming how corporations operate (instead of monolithic submission to shareholders I believe in a multi-foundational mission for corporations where community, workers, management, shareholders are all taken into consideration. This is more holistic in my view than the blind submission to shareholders who hold companies and company policy/strategy hostage). The concept of sustainable living might be a high priority for me but it is very hard given the way the system is set up, I still generate a massive amount of trash and use tons of energy\u2026 this is not to sidestep accountability, because I should be held accountable and I can do better and many things I can do... but I think even the best intentioned have a hard time because our society is set up in such a way that we are nudged (pushed!) towards more environmentally destructive options (these are cheaper, more convenient options usually, sometimes the only option). Diamond doesn\u2019t really get into this concept of reforming corporations or the infrastructure and systems within our society. I think this is a good book but if you are looking for a concise systems analysis text on the environmental issues we are facing and the earth\u2019s capacity to sustain it I highly recommend Donna Meadows Limits to Growth (30 year edition): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7... This was my favorite quote from the book and I think it is very good and can be applied to how blinded our thinking can be, including my own:\u201c[T]he values to which people cling most stubbornly under inappropriate conditions are those values that were previously the source of their greatest triumphs.\u201dOh, and here is another good quote. Diamond touches on this concept and it is pertinent to many problems: elites being insulated from the problems they create. It is often elites/corporations who extract wealth then hightail it out of there with no consequences for their actions/environmental destruction (letting other people deal with the destruction or messes they create, while elites pocket all the $$$). This quote is more about the insulation of elites on the consumption side of things, but the extraction (production) side is important imo and I was glad to see Diamond explore that problem:\u201cIn much of the rest of the world, rich people live in gated communities and drink bottled water. That's increasingly the case in Los Angeles where I come from. So that wealthy people in much of the world are insulated from the consequences of their actions.\""], ["Guns, Germs and Steel occasionally felt like monday morning quarterbacking, but Collapse is superb. In GG&S, Diamond tried to explain how technologies that evolved in some places did not in others, how some communities thrived due to excess food and more advanced agriculture, while others, perpetually on the verge of starvation, had to devote all of their time to dealing with that and thus didn't have time for building the Parthenon. The argument was not airtight - his notion of what constitutes a reasonable amount of time to spend on gathering food could use a little sharpening, and he didn't approach work as part and parcel of culture, which it most certainly is. GG&S also overlooked a lot of crops available to people he strenuously argued had nothing to eat - for example, Acai in the Amazon Basin (a superfood which constitutes 45% of the diet of some locals) and others elsewhere.In Collapse, Diamond examines how several ancient societies (Easter Island, Mangareva/Pitcairn Lapita, Maya, the Norse colonies in Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland) fell apart due to resource management issues, the environmental challenges faced by a few modern countries (Australia, Japan, China), and the best ways to avoid a tragedy of the commons-type situation that results in a drastically reduced standard of living for everyone. The author is breathtakingly impartial, sometimes to a fault; he laconically remarks, for example, that \"George W. Bush remains unconvinced of the reality of global warming.\"Overall, Diamond seems most worried about erosion, which he sees as a bigger problem than global warming because of the difficulty of replacing arable land, and the multitude of ways it can be destroyed. You can buy all the long-line-caught Chilean sea bass you want, and eat organic lettuce all day, and still have an awful impact on the environment because the soil in which the lettuce grows is a limited resource, as are the fisheries that produce the fish you buy, which also suffer from land degradation.Diamond thinks that a lot of the resources we rely on have been made artificially cheap through subsidies and foolish government management of limited resources. He's right, but there is a conflict between egalitarianism and environmentalism lurking between the pages of this book: I don't think you can charge the right amount for energy or food or other essentials without further immiserating the poor. That's the unmet challenge of the environmental movement, the one this and most books on the subject dodge. Despite that, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Collapse for its details on everyday life in Norse Greenland and Easter Island alone, not just for the nuanced analysis."]], "review_count": "2542", "description": "Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, Collapse is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?<br /><br />In his million-copy bestseller Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond examined how andwhy Western civilizations developed the technologies and immunities that allowed them to dominate much of the world.

Moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe. Environmental damage, climate change, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of these societies, but other societies found solutions and persisted. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways.

This biography took me so long to read! I began in summer 2016 but couldn\u2019t get into it. Picked it back up at the start of my fall semester this year but couldn\u2019t get into it. Picked it up again at the end of the semester and forced myself to through.All in all his was a fascinating book that did an incredible job capturing the complicated life of an American Immigrant icon. While I was reading the book I struggled with how in depth and technical it got with his patents and his competitor\u2019s patents at times but once I decided \u201cit\u2019s okay not to retain every word\u201d and just kept reading, these tid-bits of information no longer slowed me down and by the end of the book I was excited to learn more. It almost read like it was letting you in on a secret, at times differentiating what the world saw at a given time and what actually happened (like with all of his feuds and how for decades those who pirated his work were rewarded).What I enjoyed most about this tale was seeing how intertwined he was with the most powerful American families of all time. This was a man who worked with both JP Morgan and Jr. He was a direct rival of Edison and a pen pal of Elenor Roosevelt.I am incredibly happy to have finally finished this book."], ["Nikola Tesla was an amazing genius. He came very close to winning a Nobel Prize, jointly with Edison. Tesla was an brilliant, arrogant, eccentric character, full of energy. He made numerous fundamental scientific discoveries, and tried, to some extent, to capitalize on his discoveries through a whole host of inventions. He obtained many diverse patents, but he had little business sense, and this was exacerbated by corporations that often infringed on his patents without offering compensation. Corporations (Westinghouse, RCA, AT&T, American Marconi) around the turn of the century had only profit as their motive, and honor and honesty was not given even a wink. He was more responsible for wireless communication than Marconi, but to this day people credit Marconi with the invention.On the other hand, Tesla was the quintessential \"mad scientist\". He was often far ahead of his time, and people did not believe his grandiose ideas and grandiose claims. The thing is, he often came through on his grandiose claims. Before issuing a patent for \"teleautomation\", the chief patent examiner insisted on coming to witness Tesla's invention, and saw for himself that it did work. J.P. Morgan initially invested in Tesla's \"wireless\" system so that ships and racing boats could be tracked while at sea. However, Tesla took the investment and proceeded to develop ever-more grand systems to transmit radio waves across the oceans, even around the world. Then, when Tesla started to claim that he was working on wireless transmission of power, Morgan actively discouraged investors. Not because Morgan doubted that Tesla would be successful--on the contrary--he knew that the \"wizard\" would come through on his fantastic claims. Morgan did not believe in distribution of power \"for free.\"Toward the end of his life, Tesla made claims that he had invented a particle-beam death ray. We don't know if it was true--but it did get some attention from the FBI and other government agencies--after he died! And his eccentricity seems to be boundless--he hired people to feed pigeons in public places around New York City.My favorite story is about how, in the very earliest days of his wireless experiments in Colorado Springs, he heard three distinct \"taps\". Tesla attributed the taps to communications from Martians. Later he was told that Marconi had been simultaneously demonstrating to the British Navy a long-range radio transmission. Tesla, though, still held onto his claim that he was receiving messages from Mars!This book contains a wealth of detail about Tesla's life. It quotes many letters and documents written by Tesla, or to Tesla, or about him. Sometimes I felt that the book went into too much detail--it could have been considerably shorter without lessening its impact. The book contains some interesting analyses of Tesla's life, and some speculations as to why Tesla behaved as he did. The book goes into psychoanalytic speculation about reasons why Tesla became so eccentric--reasons having to do with early events in his life, when he grew up in Serbia. Tesla was the uncle of the author's father. Nevertheless, this family relationship does not seem to cloud or bias this biography. Both the good and the less-good points of Tesla's life story are included."], ["This book is actually the reason I can't check out anything at the SF Public Library anymore. I took it out years ago, and by the time I started it, it was due back again. But being the lazy bastard I am, I just kept reading it because it was so engrossing, and never renewed it. Tesla was, next to Da Vinci, probably the purest and most intuitive scientific genius ever to have lived. He was also one of the most paranoid and eccentric, but really everyone knows that is a prerequisite for genius. Seeing how badly Edison screwed him over, and the personal hatred Edison had for him, was shocking, not to mention the experiments Tesla did in Colorado with 'free energy', make it worthwhile. Oh, and he designed and tested all his machines in his head, so they worked perfectly the first time he built them almost always."], ["This was not an easy listen. Over 22 hours dense with information, including technical descriptions of Nikola Tesla's inventions!This being said, I am glad I bought this audiobook. It covers not only Tesla's inventions and ideas but also his cultural background, his relationships with quite a number of the luminaries of the times, as well as his physical and mental health. For this reader/listener with no electrical engineering background, the descriptions of Tesla's inventions and postulated theories, most of which in his own words, were a little hard to understand, let alone evaluate. However, bearing in mind that this is not a scientific appreciation of Tesla's work but his biography, the book fulfilled my desire to know more about Tesla's achievements and why he was transformed into a mythical figure. The technical descriptions were informative enough to give the general reader/listener a fairly good insight into an array of Tesla's inventions, including both the proved and the postulated ones.Therefore, I appreciate Mr. Seifer's efforts to do Nikola Tesla justice, separating the myth built around him from historic facts, fairly pointing out where Tesla was wrong, and thus bringing Tesla's fascinating accomplishments and ideas/postulated theories into proper perspective.I liked how the book was organized. It was set chronologically, yet centered on Tesla's world wireless communication system (Wardenclyffe), involving Tesla's desire and efforts to make wireless transmission of power possible (which seems to have stuck in the throat of the electrical engineering companies battling for their share in the market). What I found both interesting and saddening were the descriptions of the competition between inventors, disputes about who was 'the first' and Tesla's struggles against patent infringements. The book renders both Tesla's virtues and his weaknesses, and I must admit that some of Tesla's quirks made me dislike him at times. In spite of it, I found the events leading to the development of radio (the Wireless) most saddening. Tesla aimed valiantly high (ahead of this time), which unfortunately led him to a blind alley and lose the battle with Marconi (though he was able to recover some money in the Courts long after Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics).(view spoiler)[I digress a little, but I couldn't help but laugh at myself when I read Tesla's argument against Einstein's theory of relativity, claiming, \u201cI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. ... Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\u201cWell, as I myself was inclined to refuse to subscribe to such a view, I would recommend Tesla (if he were alive) to read Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore in order to learn how to understand/interpret Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the concept of 'curved space' properly. (hide spoiler)]All in all, I congratulate Mr. Seifer on well researched and fairly even-handed biography of Nikola Tesla. While some of Tesla's postulated inventions, as described, left me wondering whether they were only the product of a brilliant dreamer (in this context, be prepared for a bit of conspiracy theories at the end of the book, regarding Tesla's 'death beam weapon'), the book as a whole succeeded to convince me that this genius deserves better recognition.As my review refers to the audio version of Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius, let me say a word or two about the narration. Simon Prebble's performance is excellent indeed. It suits the times in which Tesla lived, as well as the general mood of the book. I particularly enjoyed how Mr. Prebble voiced Tesla's personal correspondence with J.P. Morgan and others, bringing life and personality to the characters in the book."], ["This book was long. I had my doubts about finishing this one in a month but I ended up wrapping it up in just over a week. Although, that has more to do with Tesla's character and his inventions rather than Author's writing style. Though, to be fair to the Author, he has done a decent job of making the book dramatic enough especially considering it is actually a Biography.It is clear from the book that Tesla was a Brilliant man whose ideas were well ahead of his time. At the same time, book has enough evidence and stories from his life to prove that many of those ideas were not executed to completion by Tesla. It is also clear that Tesla was no genius when it came to his social skills and financial management. This book makes you wonder what more greater inventions this great (sometimes also called mad) scientist could've done for man kind, if he had at least one of those two skills. Personally for me, the best (and partly sad) part of the book were Tesla's and J.P Morgan's exchanges. Frankly, I really do not think either J.P or Tesla were wrong in what they did. Tesla had really a lot to prove since he had no practical application of most of the claims he was making and Morgan was trying to be what he is, a Businessman. The desperation in Tesla's tone in those letters to J.P Morgan clearly presents the state of his mind in those days. In spite of that, it is commendable that Tesla's objective was more or less to bring about a Revolution in the Wireless Systems. It is even more admiring because of the fact that most of his contemporaries especially Edison, Marconi etc were bad mouthing Tesla in the scientific community and were always on the look out for ways to bring him down.Other than this, the other interesting parts were stories about Westinghouse and RCA's formation, Tesla's rivalry with Edison and Marconi, Tesla's views on Einstein's theory of relativity, World war and its impacts on US policies on Patent Infringement and many more. It is a shame that Tesla (and Edison) never won a Nobel Prize especially considering that other people who actually build their inventions using his ideas went on to get a Nobel Prize and also lived a much more financially stable life than him.Overall, I would say the book is good. Just keep in mind the fact that it is a Biography and that the Author might not be highly qualified to give you all the technical details about Tesla's inventions."], ["This was a good but difficult book. The author is intent on putting down in meticulous detail the life of this amazing character and in doing so skips around with chaotic effect. Tesla knew and interacted with many famous people of his time and it was hard keeping track of his interactions with them as the author related stories and jumped from one character to another.The author relates in detail the many inventions and ideas that Nikola Tesla advanced that were subsequently used by other inventors who gave no credit to Tesla and in fact stole his ideas. There are many instances depicted where Tesla is depicted as constantly fighting to convince the world that his ideas were stolen by other famous inventors. There are chapters which begin with one topic and then switch for no particular reason to another seemingly unrelated topic.There are things I liked about the book. I liked reading about Teslas conviction that he could communicate with Mars and how he had a vision of the world wide web and cellular communication. I was fascinated with the struggles Tesla had in the Wardenclyffe project.I liked the depiction of Teslas relationship to Katherine Underwood Johnson and would have liked a more satisfying telling of that relationship. The author simply announces at one point a list of people who died and Katherine is among this list. This is the main problem I had with this book. The organization requires better editing.Another aspect of the book that turned me off was the constant detail concerning monetary and financial problems. It seems like Tesla was constantly concerned with obtaining funding for his many inventions. I suppose this is the plight of many an inventor but I would have preferred less detailing of this (to me) boring topic.Although I struggled with this book, I did enjoy reading about this great man's life and work and would recommend this book for anyone interested in Nikola Tesla."], ["Tesla is one of the most awesomest coolio scientists evah. Totally. Check out what The Oatmeal has to say: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla.And if you're writing your dissertation on Tesla and need to know whether he was in New Jersey or New York on April 19th so that you can confirm that a conversation really took place, this is the book for you. It's great at that level of documentation. On the other hand, if you want to read about how awesomely coolio Tesla was, this book may make you want to gouge your eyes out.I do not need to know which of his instructors at university was mustachioed and which had a full head of hair. Really, really do not. Do not care. Yet I really care about Tesla - I'd love to learn more about him. This book is not the means to that end for me. The minutia killed it for me.I'd give it three stars because it obviously gives historical information that people want, but I'm mad about the way it made me feel. Admittedly I'm not an engineer and don't know a whole lot about electricity. But I'm not stupid - I read a lot of books about various branches of science. But this book was so overwhelmingly tedious that it made me want to read a picture book about Tesla. Or a pop-up book! That would be fun! I just wanted to get to the good stuff, and I felt superficial in the face of this dense collection of minutia. The emphasis on tiny unimportant (to my mind) details lessened the impact of Tesla's discoveries and inventions. The elevation of the unimportant made the important seem flat. I wasn't able to maintain my attention, and also was wearied by the effort required to sift through to find the interesting stuff.So only two stars. Tesla, though: 17 stars."], ["When I review a biography, I usually start by saying \"look how awesome this guy is\" and then rambling about his appearance, his style, etc.Well, look how awesome this guy is. He's like a more dashing Marcel Proust. He's got a handsome but not showy mustachio. He's got that cool oiled hair thing going on.But Tesla's coolness is more about his showmanship. He took this terrifying, new thing called electricity, stuff that comes down from the sky and explodes trees and cows, and he just sits there reading a magazine while it rages around him. Or he'll walk out on a stage into the midst of bolts of electricity, walking through it like it's a waterfall instead of magical death light, protected only by the cork lining his shoes.And it's not just Tesla's wacky experiments that make him so compelling. It's his personality and his history of hardships. He's a tragic figure, the Melville of science, who ran into some fame and fortune, but was ultimately condemned to a life of struggle and a death alone in a hotel room.I won't force you to read this book. But you should at least read the Wikipedia article because this dude is really interesting."], ["I\u2019m still looking for the definitive biography on Nikola Tesla because rest assured this isn\u2019t it.The author throws non-essential information about like it was confetti. I knew from the first chapter when he starts with the history of Croatia that this would be a less than promising beginning. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t get any better. People keep cropping up who had very little contact with or influence on Tesla. Information on his discoveries are kept to a minimum while matters of who filed what patent and when go on ad nauseum. There\u2019s very little real science involved. It\u2019s amazing how many times the author strays off the subject to bring up a trivial piece of data I could\u2019ve lived the rest of my life without knowing. I\u2019m willing to bet that overall more of the text is not about Tesla. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a book about such a creative genius could be balled up to the point of practically making it unreadable. Cripes! Please, somebody write a really good biography of this man who deserves better than the treatment here."], ["I'm embarrassed to admit it, but before reading this book, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had pretty much bought into the new age mythology that Tesla was a mystic genius visionary who was the victim of Edison's jealous, evil industrialist thievery and sabotage. Now, after reading accounts of Tesla's embarrassing social, financial and professional missteps, his ridiculous pleading correspondences to J.P. Morgan (and other wealthy would-be benefactors), and less than half baked journal submissions (particularly the one that interpreted a three beat radio transmission as a communication from intelligent extra terrestrials), I'm seeing Tesla in a whole new light. Rather than a victim of conspiratorial thuggery, I now see Tesla as a victim of his own chronic douchiness.Tesla was clearly decades ahead of his peers. But being \"ahead of your time\", contrary to hipster dogma, is not necessarily a good thing. Tesla had amazing ideas. But good ideas without good execution are about useless, where as even mediocre ideas, well executed, can at least be useful to someone. Tesla was with out a doubt, an amazing inventor. But it's hard not to feel like he could have achieved so much more if he wasn't such a dysfunctional, self sabotaging, grandiose douche bag.This book is a well done (if a little long) biography of a fascinating (to say the least) character from a fascinating time. But the real value of the book is as a cautionary tale of how unchecked cognitive biases (see: confirmation bias) and magical thinking can be the undoing of even brilliant and talented people like Tesla. Be warned; if your model of reality becomes too divorced from actual reality, you may needlessly fritter away your hard work and talent on some really ridiculous shit. Read this book, particularly if you like biographies of scientists, but if you're one of those Tesla worshipers, be prepared to deify the guy a whole lot less upon completion. Ultimately, the book renders a portrait of Tesla that is humane and realistic. Uncovering Tesla's scammy shenanigans, unexamined self delusions and outrageous foibles, while concurrently celebrating his incredible creativity and authentic brilliance.BTW: a film is in production starring (self serious, tortured) Christian Bale as Tesla.

By way of example, here are three quotes from the novel coupled with key concepts from the postmodern tradition along with my brief commentary.On the first pages of the novel, the narrator conveys mystery writer Quinn's reflections on William Wilson, his literary pseudonym and Max Work, the detective in his novels. We read, \"Over the years, Work had become very close to Quinn. Whereas William Wilson remained an abstract figure for him Work had increasingly come to life. In the triad of selves that Quinn had become, Wilson served as a kind of ventriloquist, Quinn himself was the dummy, and Work was the animated voice that gave purpose to the enterprise.\" ---------- Michel Foucault completely rejected the idea that a person has one fixed inner self or essence serving them as their individual personal identity. Rather, he saw personal identity as defined by a process of on-going, ever changing dialogue with oneself and others. ---------- And Quinn's interior dialogue with Work and Wilson is just the beginning. As the novels progresses, Quinn takes on a number of other identities.In his role as hired detective (quite an ironic role since Quinn is a fiction writer and has zero experience as a detective), he goes to Grand Central Station to locate a man by the name of Peter Stillman, the man he will have to tail. This is what we read after Quinn spots his man, \"At that moment Quinn allowed himself a glance to Stillman's right, surveying the rest of the crowd to make doubly sure he made no mistakes. What happened then defined explanation. Directly behind Stillman, heaving into view just inches behind his right shoulder, another man stopped . . . His face was the exact twin of Stillman's.\" ---------- The double, the original and the copy, occupies the postmodernists on a number of levels, including a double reading of any work of literature. Much technical language is employed, but the general idea is we should read a work of fiction the first time through in the conventional, traditional way, enjoying the characters and the story. Our second reading should be more critical than the first reading we constructed; to be good postmodernists, we should `deconstruct' the text to observe and critically evaluate such things as cultural and social biases and underlying philosophic assumptions. And such a second reading should not only be applied to works of literature but to all our encounters with facets of contemporary mass-duplicated society.\"As for Quinn, it is impossible for me to say where he is now. I have followed the red notebook as closely as I could, and any inaccuracies in the story should be blamed on me.\" ---------- One key postmodern idea is that a book isn't so much about the world as it is about joining the conversation with other books. ---------- Turns out, the entire story here is a construction/deconstruction/reconstruction of a book: Quinn's red notebook. Life and literature living at the intersection of an ongoing conversation - Quinn's red notebook contains references to many, many other books, including the Diary of Marco Polo, Robinson Caruso, the Bible, Don Quixote and Baudelaire. And the story the narrator relates from Quinn's red notebook is City of Glass by Paul Auster. Again, Raymond Chandler on Derrida. One final observation. Although no details are given, Quinn tells us right at the outset he has lost his wife and son. Quinn's tragedy coats every page like a kind of film. No matter what form a story takes, modern or postmodern or anything else, tragedy is tragedy and if we empathize with Quinn at all, we feel his pain. Some things never change.New York City author Paul Auster, Born 1947\u201cWould it be possible, he wondered, to stand up before the world and with the utmost conviction spew out lies and nonsense? To say that windmills were knights, that a barber\u2019s basin was a helmet, that puppets were real people? Would it be possible to persuade others to agree with what he said, even though they did not believe him? In other words, to what extent would people tolerate blasphemies if they gave them amusement? The answer is obvious, isn\u2019t it? To any extent. For the proof is that we still read the book. It remains highly amusing to us. And that\u2019s finally all anyone wants out of a book\u2014to be amused.\u201d\u2015 Paul Auster, City of Glass"], ["Paul Auster, a guy who ushers you into the silky interior of his brand new Nissan Infiniti, makes sure you've got your seatbelt on, proffers bonbons, then drives you to distraction.This book is in contravention of TWO of PB's commandments:- Thou shalt not have a character in thy book with thy own name- Thou shalt not portray the writing of a novel within thy novel such that the novel within the novel turns out to be the novel the reader is reading"], ["In my review of Paul Karasik and David Mazuchelli's graphic novel version of CITY OF GLASS, I wrote: \"The graphic artists give it so much dimension that the text-only version seems (in my memory) to be no more than a screenplay to this version's fully-realized presentation.\"My memory was wrong. I re-read the original and found it as multi-dimensional as the graphic novel version. Or perhaps the two versions together compounded the book into something greater. Or perhaps they cancelled each other out perfectly, leaving a space empty of language(s), and in its place a kind of pure expression.This attempt to reconcile meaning (being) and absence (nothingness) is the center of this Auster novel (if not his entire body of work), in which a man (a novelist), mistaken for another man (a detective), becomes that man, and then disappears. His project, as novelist and detective, is to investigate the meaning of language, or the language of meaning.The short potboiler is full of doublings and disappearances: two Peter Stillman characters; two Paul Austers, two DQ characters (Daniel Quinn and Don Quixote--and two Daniels, and two Don Quixotes!), two HDs (Henry Dark and Humpty Dumpty), two William Wilsons, two older men emerging from a train, two naps in the park, two meals of eggs, two conversations about books and theories of language, two red notebooks. A yo-yo (two yo's) that travels the same path twice, and then is gone.Auster approaches Heisenberg, Berkeley, and other philosophers with a special perspective on language: how can we name something that changes? But if we don't name something, does it exist?(p. 26) \"It was as though Stillman's presence was a command to be silent.\"(p. 122) \"And if we cannot even name a common, everyday object that we hold in our hands, how can we expect to speak of things that truly concern us? Unless we can begin to embody the notion of change in the words we use, we will continue to be lost.\"(p. 194) \"Night and day were no more than relative terms; they did not refer to an absolute condition. At any given moment, it was always both. The only reason we did not know it was because we could not be in two places at the same time.\"(p. 175) \"His ambition was to eat as little as possible, and in this way stave off his hunger. In the best of all worlds, he might have been able to approach absolute zero, but he did not want to be overly ambitious in his present circumstances. Rather, he kept the total fast in his mind as an ideal, a state of perfection he could aspire to but never achieve.\"These quotes illustrate the purpose but not the whole elegance and taut momentum of Auster's prose. It burns quick and pure, the narrative threads and characters combusting into the ether, while the essence of the city is revealed as through a clear pane.What do we see through it? The remnants of that city: \"things that truly concern us.\" (p. 122): \"The brokenness is everywhere\u2026 You only have to open your eyes to see it. The broken people, the broken things, the broken thoughts. The whole city is a junk heap.\"Quinn himself becomes homeless to prove this point, until he too disappears. Before he does, he takes a walk around the city, mirroring the rambles that Peter Stillman (Sr.) took earlier in the novel.While Stillman's walks (precisely described by Auster) traced the form of letters that spelled out TOWER OF BABEL, Quinn's walk (from page 162 - 172) is only one shape, which I traced on a map of Manhattan. I'd like to say that it clearly resembles something (like a question mark), but cannot. It could be a face, or a key. In the end I have decided that it is just a walk around the city--a meaningless and pure gesture that negates the words the novelist had written, and yet contains all possibility.*WHY I READ THIS BOOK: Originally I read this book (in the early 1990's) because my college pal Michael Ouweleen recommended it to me\u2026 I believe it came up in connection with Saul Bellow's HERZOG, but I can't recall why. I was visiting Michael in New York City, and the experience, and then the book, had a big effect on me. I devoured everything I could of Auster's, and continue reading his novels to this day. While I have enjoyed his work (unfortunately, with diminishing enthusiasm), nothing moved me like this first novel, with the possible equal of the novel The Music of Chance or his book of essays The Art of Hunger. Re-reading it now led directly from my recent experience with the graphic novel version."], ["A very intriguing exploration of the power of language to make (and unmake) the borders of our existence and the reality we experience. The main character, Quinn, is a writer of detective stories. One day, he decides to take on a serious detective job. His decision to do so, prompted by a mere phone call, seemingly represents the enthralling power of suggestion. Quinn's willing engagement with the caller, and the events that unfold from there, convey a heavily slanted view of language-experience praxis. Quinn becomes helplessly swept up in the lives of his interlocutors. He is held in thrall to the extent that he becomes a blank vehicle for their tragedies and mysterious lives. Why is this so? Auster has chosen a detective writer as a main character, whose sole means of support - as far as the reader can determine - comes from royalties from the sale of mystery books. Quinn begins the story with a knowledge of the chase, but no experience as a real detective. His real-life case, far from being an extreme case of text-to-self transference, seems to illustrate a larger truth about a dark power inherent in language, wherein word-reality has a supernatural ability to leap over cognitive barriers to create and destroy human experience.If you're still reading this review, you may wonder if the story is really just about a guy who has a pretty straightforward psychotic break. This is entirely possible but the rest of the story makes it seem unlikely.Context clues indicate that the story really is an allegory, representing the fragility of the human condition as portrayed in the downfall and disappearance of the book's characters. Language, in this case, is the agent of the Fall. Auster explicitly refers to the biblical Tower of Babel, mirroring the anomic results of that story with Quinn's own descent into confusion.The characters grope with the unknown limits of their lives, including their identity, their survival, and the peace of mind they all struggle to obtain. How does this play out in the story? The lightning rod of language is given a central agent, an insane professor (now a harmless codger) whose release from prison triggers Quinn's descent. He is summoned to protect the professor's victimized son, at which time he begins to unravel a sordid tale that eventually proves to be a gigantic McGuffin. Behold the facts: that the professor, in his heyday, attempted to abolish language and raise his son in isolation from it. This child abuse, and the linguistic hubris from which it was born, creates a legacy of suffering which ultimately destroys all it touches. Consider also that each character affected by the professor seems afflicted by a curse: they wind up broke, insane, dead, or missing. Even the main character is powerless to stop his own descent into indigence as he continues his quixotic pursuit of the word-abolisher. Yet what does the Professor actually do? He roams Manhattan, collecting junk, muttering nonsense. Meanwhile, the professor's son and his wife disappear, leaving a trail of bounced checks. But Quinn is unaware or unwilling to explore these new developments. Instead he lays in wait, hoping to catch the professor before he can do any harm. Again, unbeknownst to him, the professor commits suicide, leaving the \"detective\" in the absurd position of waiting for a dead man, sleeping in a dumpster and losing everything.Finally, Quinn gives up. He returns to his apartment, his quarry lost, his paychecks bounced, and finds that a new tenant has taken his place. In search of some redemption - anything at all - he returns to the professor's son's empty apartment. His job is now meaningless, his role irrelevant. The professor and his son left him to his own vacuity, their hysterics all but sick jokes at Quinn's expense.Now, the doors to the empty place are unlocked, seemingly in silent assent to Quinn's condition and fate. He removes his clothes and begins scribbling inane phrases in his notebook. Food appears before him as he writes, but soon he disappears. Later, we are led to understand, his notebooks serve to inform the narrator of the above events.Now Auster's vision becomes clear. We may see a significant pattern in the impotence of the characters to prevent their demise, articulated here through an assent to participate in language games. In this absurd menage-a-trois, Auster seems to point to an innate human desire - an instinct - to interpret reality on a level of verbal/linguistic constructions, regardless of the larger implications of this praxis. Each character accepts their tragedy without question, first acceding the roles of \"detective,\" \"madman,\" and \"victim,\" then \"bum,\" \"corpse,\" and \"missing person.\" As this fatal flaw unravels the protagonist's author-life, the reader recalls the mysterious deaths described by Auster at the beginning of the story. In a prior life, Quinn had a family, which also disappeared. Between the end of this life and the beginning of \"City,\" the main character developed a hunger: for companionship, for another life, for a new role to play. Yet his hunger impelled him toward another end altogether, an inner death in the form of an overreaching projection of words on reality, the absurd \"City of Glass.\" In becoming his own detective character, Quinn paid his final homage to the power of words, a mistake for which he paid with his home, his identity, and his mind.

This is like a vastly inferior The Crying of Lot 49. People who like it presumably call it a brilliant subversion of traditional mystery-genre expectations. I call it bullshit.Basically there's this writer, Quinn, who gets a mysterious call looking for a detective called Paul Auster (Auster, the author, is apparently the sort of author who includes himself as a character in his books...sigh). Quinn of course takes on both the case and Auster's identity. The only good parts of the book, I think, are when Quinn tries to act hard-boiled with the stereotypical femme, which works because he's read so many hard-boiled mystery novels. Haha. This quickly gets old as he follows a senile old man aimlessly around New York. But is this old man's wandering aimless? No! It turns out if you plot his movements on a map, they spell letters, which in turn spell words! But then those words turn out to have no bearing on the plot of this shitshow of a book. Auster abandons the heretofore somewhat interesting case, getting rid of all its characters in singularly unspectacular fashion, in favor of an identity crisis for the narrator. Quinn/Auster is so confused about his identities that he is driven insane. I've seen this before, this idea that a man with two identities or secret lives will inevitably go crazy. Whence this ridiculous notion? Actors do it with no problem, for the most part. Writers can do it, too. Clearly Auster does it himself, to no detrimental psychic effect. The whole conceit seems not only flawed but pointless, especially since the execution of the identity crisis itself is so lackluster.

The detective's name was Max Work. When Quinn went to see Peter Stillman, he said his name was Paul Auster.(Just a vessel for faux people. Like Peter Sellers.)For your consideration (all from chapter 1, so not spoilers):\"Quinn was no longer that part of him that could write books, and although in many ways Quinn continued to exist, he no longer existed for anyone but himself.\"--\"William Wilson, after all, was an invention, and even though he had been born within Quinn himself, he now led an independent life.\"--\"He (Quinn) had, of course, long ago stopped thinking of himself as real. If he lived now in the world at all, it was only at one remove, through the imaginary person of Max Work. His detective necessarily had to be real. The nature of the books demanded it.\"(Ergo... Daniel Quinn is Paul Auster?Don't quote me on that.)2. \"In effect, the writer, and the detective are interchangeable.\"3.\t\"The world of the book comes to life, seething with possibilities, with secrets and contradictions.\"(Translation: migraine migraine migraine migraine)4.\tA quote from Baudelaire from the book: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\"Auster translated this into: \"it seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not.\"Another translation: \"wherever I am not, is the place where I am myself.\"(Ergo...Daniel Quinn is Paul Auster is Paul Auster?Yeah.You can see how I suck at this game.Another phrase for sucking at something is flashing sideways)5. \tFrom Chapter 10. Daniel Quinn talked with Paul Auster (the character, not the author...although he is a li'l bit of both. At the same time! Geeenius.) about Don Quixote.Auster: \"...Cervantes, if you remember, goes to great lengths to convince the reader that he is not the author. The book, he says, was written in Arabic by Cid Hamete Benengeli. Cervantes describes how he discovered the manuscript by chance one day in the market at Toledo...\"(Can we change \"Cervantes\" with \"Paul Auster\" and \"Cid Hamete\" with \"Paul Auster\"? Wait wait. Am I getting the order wrong?Or \"Cervantes\" to \"Quinn\", \"Cid Hamete\" to \"William Wilson\"?)Quinn: \"And yet he goes on to say that Cid Hamete Benengeli's is the only true version of Don Quixote's story. All the other versions are frauds, written by imposters. He makes a great point of insisting that everything in the book really happened in the world.\"Quinn: \"...In some sense, Don Quixote was just a stand-in for himself (Cervantes).\"Auster: \"What better portrait of a writer than to show a man who has been bewitched by books?\"(and yet he goes on to say that William Wilson's version is the only true version of Daniel Quinn's stoy.In some sense, Daniel Quinn was just a stand-in for William Wilson? Or Paul Auster? No. 2, writer and detective is interchangeable...Rauf is flashing sideways and he's flashing hard)\tFFWD --Auster again: \"...But Cid Hamete, the acknowledged author, never makes an appearance....The theory I present in the essay is that he is actually a combination of four different people....\"Auster again: \"....The idea was to hold a mirror up to Don Quixote's madness, to record each of his absurd and ludicrous delusions, so that when he finally read the book himself, he would see the error of his ways.\"(But William Wilson, the acknowledged author never makes an appearance...is actually a combination of 4 people?To record each of Quinn's absurd and ludicrous delusions, etc.)Auster again: \"...Don Quixote, in my view, was not really mad. He only pretended to be. In fact, he orchestrated the whole thing himself. Remember: throughout the book Don Quixote is preoccupied by the question of posterity. Again and again he wonders how accurately his chronicler will record his adventures.\"(Quinn was not really mad...he orchestrated the whole thing himself. Major hint or major misinterpretation???)\tFFWD again --Auster's theory: \"Cervantes hiring Don Quixote to decipher the story of Don Quixote.\"(Auster using Quinn to decipher the story of Quinn?? That's a good idea for a sitcom.)Quinn: \"But you still haven't explained why a man like Don Quixote would disrupt his tranquil life to engage in such an elaborate hoax.\"Auster: \"That's the most interesting part of all. In my opinion, Don Quixote was conducting an experiment. He wanted to test the gullibility of his fellow men. Would it be possible, he wondered, to stand up before the world and with the utmost conviction spew out lies and nonsense? To say that windmills were knights, that a barber's basin was a helmet, that puppets were real people? Would it be possible to persuade others to agree with what he said, even though they did not believe him?In other words, to what extent would people tolerate blasphemies if they gave them amusement?The answer is obvious, isn't it?\"(Quinn wants to test the gullibility of men -- would it be possible to persuade others to agree with what he said, even though they did not believe him?)I'm sure no one read this far. Now I can confess something embarassing. My favorite Godfather film is the third one!!! Phewf. Glad I got that out of my chest...6.\tAnother character, Peter Stillman, Sr. really believed in this theory:\"If the fall of man also entailed a fall of language, was it not logical to assume that it would be possible to undo the fall, to reverse its effects by undoing the fall of language, by striving to recreate the language that was spoken in Eden?If man could learn to speak this original language of innocence, did it not follow that he would thereby recover a state of innocence within himself?\"IMPORTANT for the ending.Number 7 is definitely a major spoiler. Unless I got it wrong. Then it's just a weird cherry on top of this weird sundae. You've been warned...7.\tAfter the long discussion about Quixote and Cervantes, Daniel Quinn met Daniel Auster, Paul's little boy. Daniel Auster would be the same age as Daniel Quinn's dead son -- DQ's wife and son died at the same time.Then D.A. said: \"Everybody's Daniel!\"Just some stupid thing a kid said or important to the story?But looking back at my notes....I don't know. I'm still stymied.Aren't I?Quinn made it all up? No. Paul Auster made Quinn made it all up?? That's kinda M. Night Shyamalan-y.In the end: Quinn kept writing and writing on his red notebook (\"...something about it [the notebook:] seemed to call out to him -- as if its unique destiny in the world was to hold the words that came from his pen\") and then he lost his Innocence...because he was no longer \"in the dark.\"Quinn suffered the Fall of Language. He wanted to write about \"infinite kindnesses of the world and all the people he had ever loved. Nothing mattered now but the beauty of all this. He wanted to go on writing about it, and it pained him to know that this would not be possible.\""]], "review_count": "625", "description": "Nominated for an Edgar award for best mystery of the year, <i>City of Glass</i> inaugurates an intriguing <i>New York Trilogy</i> of novels that <i>The Washington Post Book World</i> has classified as \"post-existentialist private eye...

The Professor carefully unfastened the clamps and handed it to Randolph.\"Against the Day, a novel by Thomas Pynchon,\" exclaimed the intrepid aeronaut as he studied the flyleaf. \"Published in... 2007?!\"\"Quite so, quite so,\" murmured the Professor. \"By far our most successful experiment to date. Nearly a whole century forward. Please, read on!\" The other Chums crowded around their leader and peered over his shoulder as he turned the pages. There certainly were a great many of them.\"I can't make head or tail of it,\" admitted Randolph after a few minutes of study. \"All these... mathematical equations...\" \"Long sentences,\" added Chick. \"And foreign words,\" concluded Darby. \"It is, indeed, something of a challenge,\" said the Professor. \"But, as you will no doubt remember, literary theory has long been a passion of mine. I remain convinced that, with suitable mechanical aids, even the most recondite screed will happily yield up its--\"He broke off in mid-sentence; from the glances being exchanged between Randolph and Miles, it was all too clear that they had not yet forgotten their unfortunate encounter with the Pansensual Gerty MacDowell Experience (see The Chums of Chance and the Jujubes of Joyce). But after a moment of hesitation, he continued, ignoring his young friends' skeptical expressions. \"I have studied the text carefully,\" said the Professor. \"It soon becomes clear that the theme of mirroring is of central importance. Reflections and twins abound. Professor Renfrew, and his 'conjugate', Professor Werfner. Vibe, and his shadow Foley. Venice and Venice im Wien. The Isola degli Specchi. The curious doubly refractive properties of Iceland spar. Do you begin to see?\"\"No,\" said Miles truthfully.\"It will become clearer,\" said the Professor with unshakable confidence. \"What we are being told to consider, we soon realize, is the essential duality of nature. Yin and yang. Waves and particles. Vectors and quaternions. Bras and--\"\"Panties?\" suggested Chick.\"I was in fact about to say kets,\" said the Professor, not in the least discomfited. \"But that too. What, after all, is sex, viewed in formal terms, but a vain attempt to find a common eigenbasis for two generally non-commutative operators?\"Chick tried, with rather limited success, to find a rejoinder to this no doubt penetrating question. But before he could stammer more than a syllable or two, the Professor was off again.\"I tried to determine what it was the author was telling me,\" he continued. \"Why all these mirrors? I thought of Alice through the Looking-Glass, since childhood one of my favorite tales. And then it hit me. Lolloping Laplacians! This was evidently not the real book at all, but merely its reflection. The first step must thus be to build a device capable of restoring the true text. Luckily, I happened to have a high-quality calcite crystal and a good understanding of quaternionic theory. The decoding instrument was easy to construct.\"He strode back to the \"microscope\", replaced the thick volume in its original position, and adjusted the focus. \"Here,\" he said. \"Look at it again!\"Randolph peered through the eyepiece and whistled. \"I thought it was bad before,\" he said. \"But now! Mathematical symbols on each page, every third sentence in some outlandish language or other...\"\"One cannot deny it!\" said the Professor cheerfully. \"But having proceeded so far, we must not let ourselves be deterred. This, we have determined, is the true book. But what is it saying?\"He paused, pretending to wait for an answer to his transparently rhetorical question, but received none. \"I realized,\" he said, his voice now almost a whisper, \"that it was telling us how to understand the other world... the world on the other side of the Mirror.\"\"You mean the Looking-Glass World?\" asked Randolph. But the Professor shook his head. \"No,\" he breathed. \"not the Looking-Glass World... for, I have now come to understand, we are the Looking-Glass World, the imaginary, quaternionic world. What this book is telling us is how to reach the real world.\"The Chums gaped open-mouthed, stunned by the enormity of the revelation they had just received.\"But...\" said Lindsay in the end, \"if the book is incomprehensible...\"\"No book is incomprehensible,\" replied the Professor briskly. \"My work with Joyce convinced me of that. I now have in place a rigorous study program. Intensive courses in the development of the labor movement, the histories of Mexico and the Balkans, techniques of silver mining, the dynamics of \u00c6ther vortices, special and general relativity, vector calculus, Riemann's \u03b6-function, cricket, the exploits of the duc de Richelieu--\"\"Is that the third duc de Richelieu,\" asked Linday, who was taking notes, \"the one who was involved with \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet?\"\"The very same,\" said the Professor, without pausing for breath. \"As for languages, obviously French, German, Spanish, Italian and Russian. Latin and Greek go without saying. Then it is undoubtedly useful to possess at least a smattering of Dutch, Croatian, Albanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Turkish, Japanese, Swedish, Finnish--\"\"But...\" expostulated Miles, \"even if one had a century of study time...\"\"You underestimate recent advances in educational theory,\" retorted the Professor with a mischievous look. \"Choose a language, any language!\"\"You said Finnish?\" suggested Darby. \"We were there once (see The Chums of Chance and the Curse of Karelia) and I picked up a few words of the lingo. Here, yksi, kaksi--\"\"An excellent start!\" said the Professor. \"Follow me!\"Snatching up the book again, he opened a door and led the Chums down a long corridor. After passing a dozen oak-paneled doors, they paused before one marked DEPARTMENT OF SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGES. The Professor knocked; a moment later, an arctically blonde young woman emerged, dressed in an alluringly brief ensemble consisting of a few scraps of reindeer leather. \"Excuse us for troubling you, Liisa,\" the Professor said, giving her a courtly bow. \"My young friend wishes to improve his grasp of Finnish.\" He turned to Darby. \"Unless you have got 'cold feet'?\"\"No siree,\" said Darby with undisguised enthusiasm. \"Boy-oh-boy!\"\"Excuse me,\" interrupted Lindsay in a prudishly horrified tone, \"I would just like to assure myself that this is entirely 'legit'--\"His protestations came too late; Liisa pulled Darby into the room, which appeared to contain little except a blackboard and a large bed, and closed the door, after which there came the unmistakable sound of a key being turned in a 'Yale' lock. \"You need have no fear,\" said the Professor reassuringly to Lindsay. \"We use the most modern techniques, intensive one-on-one tuition based on a version of the sexualpedagogiska metoden which Fr\u00f6ken Suomalainen has in fact been instrumental in developing...\" He continued in similar vein for a few minutes, without notably increasing Lindsay's confidence, until the door opened again and Darby stumbled out, tie orthogonally askew and almost implausibly well-informed about the inessive case.\"Was the experiment a success?\" asked the Professor.\"Who-whee!\" said the young student by way of answer. \"What's next?\"\"I think perhaps some higher mathematics,\" mused the Professor, opening another door marked ADVANCED RIEMANNIAN STUDIES. A brunette with an Italian accent was explaining the concept of hyperbolic geometry, with frequent references to her dramatic d\u00e9colletage; but before Darby could sit down, Lindsay, wise from his earlier mistake, marched him out into the corridor again.\"Now,\" he said firmly. \"What I want to know is, do we really need all this?\"\"It is barely enough to keep up,\" said Professor Vanderjuice in a wounded tone. Randolph and Miles, familiar with this concept from an earlier adventure (see The Chums of Chance and the Red Queen's Race), nodded, but Lindsay set his jaw defiantly.\"Let's see what Pugnax thinks,\" he muttered. \"If I may?\" He relieved the Professor of the book, which he was still holding, and bent down to show it to the hyperintelligent canine. \"Rrrf!\" exclaimed Pugnax after a few moments of perusal. \"Rrrff-rrf-RRF! Rrrf!\" The Professor suddenly looked shamefaced.\"To be completely honest,\" he sighed, \"your dog has a point. I have perhaps been a little too enthusiastic in promoting my new invention. In fact, it is sufficient to have a robust sense of humor.\"\"Rrrf, rrf-rrf!\" added Pugnax. \"Rrf!\" Vanderjuice sighed again. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he said with just a hint of asperity. \"And a dirty mind.\""], ["I loved traveling along the four parallel storylines of this, the longest of Pynchon's books. I think I fell in love with Dahlia Rideout (sorry Kit). I wanted to be one of the Chums of Chance or at least read their books to my kid with the Hardy Boys. I wanted to have a whiskey with Lew Basnight (although I may have been terrified). I loved the bad guys and the good guys and really all the characters here. There was so much to enjoy, so much to think about, never a dull moment. Of all of Pynchon's books, this was probably the most fun (even if I preferred Mason&Dixon for its two main characters).In retrospect, I find myself dreaming and pondering AtD more than GR or M&D. I have even developed a slight obsession with Dahlia Rideout as my favorite heroine of all time (am I alone of this particular fetish or have her beautiful eyes and sassy talk seduced other readers as well?) i wish that Brian Vaughn would do a comic of the adventures of The Chums of Chance (rather than The Escapist) as that was also an awesome and beautiful part of the plot. AtD makes me wish in vain that there was more Pynchon out there to read, but, alas, there is not."], ["Like all great things, Against The Day refuses summary. By its length and complexity, the sheer amount of Time it takes to get through, the concentration it requires to keep track of its multitude of characters, its encyclopedia of settings and events, its fascination with emerging ideas, scientific advances, political movements, technologies, its exploration of a wide variety of metaphysics and religious ideas, its globe-spanning survey of world events at the turn of the last century, by its very form and nature and what it demands of its serious readers it consumes one as one consumes it- a dedicated reader must live with it and make it live with them. I found myself unable to read anything else while reading it. It tendrils itself into one\u2019s being, and at multiple levels, for its vast intellectual wells, its deep humanity, its overt tenderness, its tendency to search out the ineffable anima of its characters, to locate the emotional node in a natural setting, often only by a fleeting observational note, how it errs on the side of the complex and the mind-bending and often absurd, how it is dedicated to not explaining its mysteries, while at the same time not shying away from lengthy digressions on mathematical abstractions and physical properties of minerals and light and space, might seem in contrast to the fanciful \u201cboy\u2019s adventure comic\u201d framing device of the novel, its frequent low-brow wordplay and ridiculous jokes, and the many turn-of-the-century story cliches it employs, expands upon, subsumes into its cosmos- pistol-packin\u2019 Westerns, hard-boiled detective novels, science fiction, prairie family dramas, etc.- but this is far from the case. The \u201ctypes\u201d employed that fill out this huge cast of characters and events are only more framing devices, tropes, daubs on the palette of a set of collective narrative tactics, a kind of collection of familiar apparitions used to set in motion Pynchon\u2019s universe-sized epic.This is one of those Big Books where it is arguable that the true \u201ccharacters\u201d of the novel are the mechanics of the universe. Light and Darkness, Time, the Stars, Gravity, Earth, Mathematics, Death, Rebirth, New Life. But this would be disregarding that the novel is really, simply, a drama of two families at the end of the 19th and early decades of the 20th century, living through its changes and disasters, its sociopolitical upheavals. And how perfect their names- Traverse and Rideout. Rideout and Traverse. One might also easily be persuaded that this is a pure fantasy novel, for it cares not for adhering to the rules of this universe, and the Chums of Chance, the aeronautic motivus of action in the book, transcend all rules of space, time, and physics. Ghosts and wanderers from the future dwell in its pages- psychics, seances, the Tarot, other-dimensional interventions are ubiquitous, impossible objects and geometry-defying buildings and landscapes abound. Within the world of ATD the fantastic lives directly astride the Real, parted only by a thin veil that is constantly leapt across. As well, one could be tempted to call ATD an historical novel (because it is pure historical fictioneering) for one of Pynchon\u2019s great preoccupations here is the \u201csingling up of all lines\u201d of history into its inevitability- how the past, when it was present tense, shed all other possibilities to become the future it became. But he extends this and asks: What of the infinite possible pasts, and if their infinite futures were realized? What have become of and where are located the possible futures we have shed by narrowing down potentiality through choice and chance?- These other worlds, dimensions, or speculative universes are the true setting of Against The Day, and all the talk of Vectorists, Quaternions, Riemann surfaces, tesseracts, properties of the Aether, of Light, of Iceland spar and its double-refractive properties, are ways of asking a huge question, one we are caught in the very middle of in this experiment of becoming ever more conscious beings: Once, men sat and looked out on a flat plain and called that plain the world, and the world was thought flat and the center of the universe- then we built ships and set out, and found the world was round, and then we went further and found that the earth was not the center of the universe at all, but a speck in a cosmos unimaginably huge and complex- and so we built ships to attempt a crossing of that other ocean, the one not of water but of Space, and as we progress onward making discoveries and refining mathematics, it might follow that that first uncentering of the earth, the first rounding of the earth, might be the first of a long process of uncentering, of \u201crounding\u201d the universe into its proper form and setting- maybe a thread, a membrane, or a spheroid amongst countless, uncountable other universes, maybe expanding forever into what we can\u2019t conceive, and what might this mean, and who is out there living beside us, invisibly, each and every fractured moment of our lives? And are there other Selves out there, doubled, trebled, even uncountable versions of us living out lives across this multi-dimensional sprawl? What are their destinies? And, considering the unbearable tragedies of History personal and universal, what might have been?Light and darkness, their ambiguities, how their antagonism creates our reality. Life and death, and the borderlands between, thin as a tissue, wavering in a gust of wind. Dreams and waking life, and what\u2019s the difference and how would we know when we are within one and within the other? Identity, what we are at any given moment, the way we know ourselves to be ourselves. Mathematics, science, and religion, the development of how humans attempt to explain their strange presence here in this baffling realm, which seems made not to be bound in words and symbols, but always becomes so, more and more, each day, with each new sunrise, both more understandable and simultaneously more mysterious, unexplainable. The heart and the head. All lines of history, specifically at the turn of the last century, singling up into the slaughterhouse of WWI and its death-twin two decades later, hand in hand, devouring generations and echoing like the tolls of dead bells even now, remaining in toxic presences flitting in and out of our collective consciousness, what those events tell about our nature. The horror behind us, and what\u2019s ahead? What might we make of the Time remaining? Love and absence. Family. Madness and revenge. Chance and determination. Free will or despotism. Anarchy and capitalism. These ideas, questions, problems, swirling around us in the aether, facets of mind and world- our Being is composed of how we confront these. Against The Day has somehow managed to map and tell a comedic epic of Being underneath these storm-skies, these cloud-form-phenomena that hang above us all, ready to let light in or rain down lightning and thunderous darkness. How does one possibly novelize questions like these, bring them into our terms and under the control of our language? However it is done, Pynchon has achieved that here.And it builds and builds throughout its 1100 pages to the finale, and it is fun and funny the entire time, and it is packed full of adventure and danger and heros and villains, narrow escapes and love affairs, and it is deep and wide and tender and sad and strange and struck through with longing and loss and incomprehensibility, like existence. And like us it anticipates something parting the darkened sky, a vehicle of magic bearing \u201cgood unsought and uncompensated\u201d, from some dimension better than ours, to deliver us, to carry us away in light- We of the Futurity of Narrowing Possibilities, we await our Chums of Chance. They fly toward grace."], ["Update the second, March 08Well, well, well [she says, much subdued, pensive; not at all her normal, boistrous, effusive self].Here we are, March 1, 2008, and I have just closed the cover of Against the Day.I suppose it's hard to even talk about a tome like this, a thing of this range and scope and breadth. I'd really like to use all the superlatives I can, and then invent new words to describe Pynchon and what he does, because he really is like nothing else ever. In fact, I've been saying that to all my friends over the months I've been ensconsed in this book, that what Pynchon writes are not novels, in any traditional sense, I think. They just flagrantly ignore the rules of structure, and sense, and momentum. If you'll indulge me, I've come up with a sort-of analogy for this. It's like, instead of reading a book, you're like reading a chunk of a river. (Bear with me here.) Whereas normally a book will progress, go beginning-middle-end, this one is like a million rivulets, each slipping overunderthrough one another, that you follow for a second, or a couple pages, until they go back under and get lost in the general cacophony. Lots of the characters even have names like that -- Stray, Reef, Lake, Heartsease, Ljubica (which means 'love'), Ryder -- that just slip through your fingers as you say them, as the characters go somewhere else and you lose track. There are no beginnings or ends to a river (see? I'm bringing it back), you just watch as different bits of it flit by. I mean, how can I read something else now? This book kind of disassembles your concept of reading, of how to read, of how to go through a book. In a way I feel like I should just keep reading this, over and over, for the rest of my reading life. Also, because of all this, 1,085 pages is really nowhere near enough. There is so much more to the lives of these characters! I mean because the book really encompases the whole world, right? So everyone is still living somewhere, in the world between the pages (because, oddly, I don't know that anyone of note actually dies in this book), and I want to know what they do with the rest of their lives, who they go on to love, how they fight, what cities they stumble through, how they find their circuitous destinies. (This is insanely presumptuous, but I think Pynchon might be fond of that thought, since so much is made in this book of people doubling, and living many lives, in and out of the world, or the 'Counter-Earth', or within photographs, or after having Zombini do some kind of spell, or that thing with the Iceland spar, which I don't know if I really get.)I guess I'm babbling. But I think that's fitting too, for this book. I've gotten a lot of different kinds of shit from different friends for my rapturous devotion to Mr. Pynchon. I don't care. I also don't care that this is probably a sort of frustrating review, which doesn't say much at all about the book. I also don't care that there is obvs so much in this book that I didn't get, and would never get, even if I did spend the rest of my reading life on it. I don't care. I am fiercely in love with Against the Day. I am fanatically devoted to Thomas Pynchon. I am so, so thrilled that I read this book.Update, Jan 08 In case anyone's keeping track, I am just a smidge over halfway through this fucker. And as a diversion, I present you with a few random samples of Pynchonery:\"Abruptly, sweeping into the scene like an opera singer with an aria to unload, here came 'Mr. Ace,' as he called himself. Glossy black eyes, presented like weapons in a duel. When he smiled, or attempted to, it was not reassuring.\"\"It was all he could do not to reach for her, gather her into some kind of perimiter. But the moisture in her eyes was shining like steel, not dew, and nothing about her trembled.\"\"You could hear faint strands of music, crazy stuff, banjos and bugling, trombone glissandi, pianos under the hands of whorehouse professors sounding like they came with keys between the keys.\"\"Dally's voice was hard to pin down to any one American place, more of a trail voice with turns and drops to it, reminders of towns you thought you'd forgotten or should never've rode into, or even promises of ones you might've heard about and were fixing to get to someday.\"See? See??First entry, Nov 07wooooo hoooooooooo!!!!!(that's me going down the rabbit hole, as it were, into the depths of Pynchonalia)Also, it's so convenient that the folios of this book are such that there are five blank pages at the back. Now I can (with no shame whatsoever) keep a list of all the characters!

of Against the Day were all a little bewildered, and gave me the distinct impression that a lot of reviewers had tried to skim-read this huge novel so they could get their articles written in time. It's not an easy one to write up at all. It's very long, very busy, and you come to it with all kinds of preconceptions, just because it's Pynchon and although he's only written a few novels they all seem to be masterpieces.For people who have been following him over the years, it's something of a change of direction. His last two books, Vineland and Mason & Dixon, seemed to show a new concern with characters, personalities and intimacy compared to the unreconstructed craziness of his earlier work. But Against the Day has much more in common with his earlier books \u2013 it most closely resembles Gravity's Rainbow (the hipster's long novel of choice), although there is a weariness, a kind of ironic distance at work here which points to an older author.If it seems like I'm putting off the business of actually trying to explain what this novel's about, it's because I am. Ostensibly we are looking at a timeframe moving from the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 to the years immediately after the First World War. Pynchon has always been much more interested than his compatriot writers in the world outside America, and here we get wonderful sketches of everywhere from Colorado, New York and Chicago to Siberia, London, Yugoslavia, Morocco, revolutionary Mexico, Constantinople, Venice and plenty more besides. The cast of characters is huge, though not as disorienting as some reviewers have made out. The main plot strand concerns three brothers from Colorado trying to avenge their father's murder, though there is also a boy's-own spy story involving British agents and unrest in the Balkans, not to mention a whole subplot about characters who are at least partly fictional even within the world of the novel.It's not even entirely certain whether or not these events are taking place precisely in our world. In the novel, not only do we have the new force of electricity changing the face of society, but we also have mathematicians and scientists devising machines which can make photographs move or allow for the possibility of time-travel. In many ways it's written not as a historical novel but as a sci-fi novel might have looked written by someone in the 1880s. \u2018By now,\u2019 someone remarks at one point, \u2018I know that your most deranged utterances are only conventional history prematurely blurted.\u2019At first that just seems like a cute conceit, but as the novel goes on it assumes a greater importance. There is always a suggestion that the world of possibilities shown in here somehow became our own world after some cataclysmic event, which is especially associated with the War. \u2018This world you take to be \u201cthe\u201d world will die,\u2019 says one character, \u2018and descend into Hell, and all history after that will belong properly to the history of Hell.\u2019The upcoming war looms over everything, just as the Second World War did over Gravity's Rainbow. It is conceived as being so awful that it has stained time itself, affecting events long before it happened with an air of sinister disaster. It is the darkness behind everyday events, which is sensed preternaturally by almost every character in the book, and which allows Pynchon to give free rein to his delight in finding mystery and paranoia in otherwise normal events. Who else would, or could, describe a sunrise like this:The sun came up a baleful smear in the sky, not quite shapeless, in fact able to assume the appearance of a device immediately recognizable yet unnameable, so widely familiar that the inability to name it passed from simple frustration to a felt dread, whose intricacy deepened almost moment to moment \u2013 its name a word of power, not to be spoken aloud, not even to be remembered in silence.Here you can see all Pynchon's trademarks \u2013 the long sentences, stacks of clauses skirting round some inexplicable sensation of mystery, a general feeling that you're never totally sure what he's going on about. It is this mood, rather than any event-based plot, which Pynchon is concerned with describing. And the writing is everything you'd hope for \u2013 I think he's the best writer of sentences since Nabokov. Some of the turns of phrase stop you dead: a view from a hotel window of \u2018long, moon-stung waves\u2019; a rough night for someone who \u2018didn't so much sleep as become intermittently conscious of time\u2019; or an emotional parting at a railway station, of which we are told: \u2018though their kiss went on for what could have been hours, so little did it have to do with clock time, she was already miles away down those rails before their lips even touched.\u2019Looking back through my copy to pick out these passages, it's telling that I can hardly remember now which characters are even being written about here. They seem less important than what he uses them to say. Some people might even call them types; you could certainly be forgiven for getting a bit suspicious about the way every single female character is a submissive nymphomaniac \u2013 though that certainly allows for a lot of fun along the way. (OK, there's one major exception, but she's a dominant nymphomaniac.) The verisimilitude is also not helped much by the outrageous names everyone seems to have, like Professor Heino Vanderjuice or a musician called Chester LeStreet (hee-hee). It's definitely a little disappointing after where he seemed to be going with the last couple of books, but still, there's no doubt that by the end there are a core group of people who you really do care about.And they can be fun too. One of the many pleasures of the book comes from the incongruence of people and places, like the grizzled American detective who finds himself working for a tarot cult among the upper classes in London. The Colorado boys in particular generate some fantastically gruff dialogue, including one of my favourite remarks: \u2018Tengo que get el fuck out of aqu\u00ed.\u2019 The women are intelligent and funny and, as I mentioned, permanently horny. He does sexy rather well. \u2018Just can't stay away,\u2019 whispers one respectable girl who has ended up all corrupted in a brothel out west, \u2018\u2026you've simply ruined me for everyday bourgeois sexuality. Whatever am I to do?\u2019The proliferation of characters is partly down to one of the book's most important themes, that of doubling. Two of the cast, Renfrew and Werfner, are mirror-images of each other in more than just name; someone else finds himself wondering if he could be his own ghost. We hear much of the shamanic practice of bilocation, by which someone can be literally in two places at once, and there is also a preoccupation with Iceland spar, a kind of crystal which creates a doubling of light \u2013 and, by implication, of the world itself. Pynchon seems to have taken the advice of one of his characters: \u2018When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\u2019Like a lot of Pynchon's books, it starts off being a whole lot of fun with crazy jokes and weird sex and unnecessary songs, and yet again by the time you're sucked in you can't help feeling that something very important is going on. It seems to have to do with understanding what kind of person you might have been if some choices had been made differently, and what kind of world there could have been if some choices had been made differently. With some aliens, threesomes, tommyknockers, cowboys and meteorites thrown in.Have we been here before? Oh\u2026maybe. Still, it seems a bit harsh to criticise him for producing more of the same when the same is so brilliant, so rich, and so full of complex and fascinating pleasures. Above all I was left feeling the sadness and the wonder of all the potential worlds I and everyone else could be creating, if we only had more time to stop and work out how. As one of the many walk-on reprobates points out:\u2026isn't it the curse of the drifter, this desolation of heart we feel each evening at sundown, with the slow loop of the river out there just for half a minute, catching the last light, pregnant with the city in all its density and wonder, the possibilities never to be counted, much less lived into, by the likes of us, don't you see, for we're only passing through, we're already ghosts."], ["An amazing book, describing a time of turmoil and discovery, showing the best and worst of mankind and individual men and women. This multifaceted story begins at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and ends after the world altering events of World War I. The world is moving into new areas; armies on horseback are giving way to men with machine guns. The wide open West of the United States is being increasingly hemmed in by wealthy industrialists who hire \"goons\" with guns to break strikes. In Europe, the structure of the continent is changed by the outcome of WWI. And against this background, there is a large cast of characters living big lives. Anarchists around the globe strike out against those that would control them.Then there are the metaphorical levels of the book.. Here the major motif is light in its many forms and applications: natural, man-made, possibly supernatural. Mentions of light occur constantly and light is the subject of some characters's work. Time and space also are constantly considered; I.e. slipping in and out of present time or space, etc. If the book were a bit shorter, I might consider a re-read to track these themes. One of the most spectacular instances of light is that of the Tunguska Event which unnerved people in a large swath of the world for some time.As I neared the end, I began to think about the broad themes of this book: light (? as an entity in itself, as a force), light vs darkness, anarchy and anarchists, power, evil, war, money behind most evil and only limited good. And the characters, well they are geniuses and dummies, killer's and serial lovers, anarchists and strikebreakers, millionaires and peasants, dreamers and realists.... In short, they are all of humanity and some who may not be of this world.Like Mason & Dixon, the other Pynchon book I've read (and recommend) Against the Day is historical fiction, fantasy, sci fi, a picture of a world on the brink of massive change--economically, politically, in the military, scientifically, geopolitically, essentially in almost every way. The only difference is the century. Pynchon has given us a work that in some ways is indescribable but is a wonder to read. As I have said before, I will readily admit: I do not understand much of it, but that didn't interfere with my enjoyment."], ["PYNCHON IS THE UTOPIUM OF THE MATH CLASSES:A Rhapsody of Exquisitely Mindful Pleasures\n\"Nobody ever said a day has to be juggled into any kind of sense at day's end.\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Gravity's Rainbow\"]\nMost authors inadvertently encourage us to be lazy readers. They make it too easy to read their fiction. We expect authors to comply with conventions of story-telling, a manageable number of characters, a narrative arc, a sense of relevance and progress towards a conclusion, a climax, a goal, a realisation and/or an understanding.Pynchon doesn't necessarily write this way. He takes us to a world that might look like ours, but it is potentially alien (or at least foreign), in that there are some things or a lot of things that we do not know or understand about it.\"I'll tell you a story someday. Maybe.\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Against the Day\"]What we see and experience at first might look familiar, superficially, but ours is the experience of a tourist, a stranger in a strange land or a space traveler landing on a distant moon or planet.We have to construct knowledge, meaning and understanding, bit by bit, like a spy, a sleuth or a detective.\"...a crime, often of the gravest sort, committed in a detective story, may often be only a pretext for the posing and solution of some narrative puzzle...\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Against the Day\"]Pynchon doesn't just present his fictional world to us in easily digested mouthfuls. Whether or not his novels are difficult, they require mastication, exertion. We have to work on them. We have to do our bit. Having bitten off, we must chew. This is their challenge, but even more importantly this is our reward. Pynchon offers us not mindless pleasures (an early working title for \"Gravity's Rainbow\"), but exquisitely mindful pleasures.\"'Oh, you're overthinking it all,' Yashmeen said, 'as usual.'\" [Thomas Pynchon, \"Against the Day\"]That said, what would a Pynchon novel be if you didn't endeavour to think (or overthink) it through?Are we meant to settle for studied incomprehension?\"NOW SINGLE UP ALL LINES!\"The first line of the novel is a nautical term that relates to the preparation of a ship (or in this case, an airship) to leave its mooring and depart (or take off).Several sets of double ropes would normally secure the ship in its place. This command reduces the mooring to one rope in each position. It\u2019s a halfway step.Just as it releases the ship, it releases the lines themselves: once freed of their burden, the lines can now float free. They might also represent the verbal lines of the book, which are then commanded to cast off \u201ccheerly now... handsomely... very well,\u201d a perfect description of what Pynchon proceeds to do throughout the novel. He writes comically, eloquently and effectively.\"It's Always Night, or We Wouldn't Need Light\"The epigraph is attributed to Thelonious Monk in a Time Magazine profile published in 1964. While it might have been an expression that Monk used frequently, it could be a misquotation of another expression attributed to Monk by the saxophonist Steve Lacy in 1960:\"It must be always night, otherwise they wouldn't need the lights.\"The two expressions have slightly different connotations. The first implies that the darkness of the night requires the enlightenment of the day or lighting. However, the second, in the context of jazz musicians playing at night in clubs, implies that the dimly lit darkness is a precondition for their music, their creativity, spontaneity and improvisation.The darkness is not a negative quality that needs to be alleviated by the light. It\u2019s a positive that allows individuals to perform at their best.\"Against the Day\"This construction, if it\u2019s credible, hints at the meaning of the title \"against the day\".In the novel, which is set between the 1890\u2019s and the early 1920\u2019s (the era in which Modernism began), it\u2019s the light of day that is the negative. It symbolises the work of the Devil, the obviousness and conformity of the crowd, and its scrutiny by the powers that be (whether governments or employers). Pynchon\u2019s sympathy is very much with non-conformists, anarchists and socialists who are battling against capitalism and imperialism (or different manifestations of civilisation promoted by Great Britain, Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Tsarist Russia and Turkey), often with the only tools available to them: strikes, protests, assassinations, bombings and terrorism.The latter are the underground (the counterculture), the former the overground (the over the counter culture). Above them all are the Chums of Chance, \"a five-lad crew\" (plus their dog, Pugnax, who enjoys reading Henry James\u2019 \u201cThe Princess Casamassima\u201d, also a novel about radical politics featuring a terrorist assassination plot) who float above the world in their airship (\u201cthe Inconvenience\u201d), privileged to have a map-like perspective or birdseye view of the clashes of civilisations occurring on the surface.By befriending chance, they too oppose (law and) order, and embrace the chaos of unrestrained freedom, free as birds (although as Bob Dylan would later ask in \"Ballad In Plain D\", \"are birds free from the chains of the skyway?\") Servants of Greed and ForceUnderlying the clash of civilisations is a (daylit) certainty that I (the sovereign Subject) am right and you (the Other object which is the subject of sovereignty) are wrong.Pynchon questions certitude and power from both mathematical and metaphysical perspectives.The maths might deter some readers who would otherwise thoroughly enjoy the novel. However, in truth, it's not necessary to study up on it, unless you're particularly inclined to do so. It's primarily contextual, and there is enough explanation in the novel itself to get Pynchon's drift.The maths is largely dispensed with in the first third to half of the novel. I tried to keep up, but still found myself doing some online research to determine how much I was missing out on. However, once I felt that I had some basic layman's understanding of the issues, I was content to focus on the pleasures of the text.This mightn't be much comfort to a sceptical or impatient reader, but I found that it was a lot easier to read, comprehend and enjoy the novel after the first 490 pages or so!The Fork in the Silk RoadThe maths helps to understand the concept of doubling or coupling that is fundamental to the book.Neither concept is far removed from Nabokov's employment of doubles in \"Lolita\". It's a literary or cultural device, in this case, one built on a mathematical or scientific foundation.If we start with a ray of light passing through a prism (such as Iceland spar), it's possible that the ray might be refracted into two sets of waves or particles. Thus, the thing that was once singular might now be separate or double. If there is a symmetry between the refracted light, one wave might be the opposite or inverse of the other.Thus, we have the potential for both \"bi-location\" and \"algebraic coupling\".However, what is separate or inverted can potentially be joined or reverted.Pynchon jokes that the German word \"und\" when refracted and inverted might become the English word \"pun\". Thus, yet again (after \"Mason & Dixon\"), a conjunction is both significant and comical.Metaphysically, what was once one, but is now two, might either engage in a life and death struggle, or seek to be re-united.Thus, the double can either encounter itself in duplicity or oneness.This is equally applicable to nations and people.Dive-Bombing into the DayFrom a national perspective, duplicity can result in war, unless resolved by treaty or entente.There's much conflict between civilisations and nations in the novel. This aspect reminded me of Lawrence Durrell's works \"White Eagles Over Serbia\" and \"The Alexandria Quartet\", just as much as boys' own adventure stories from the days of the British Empire (subsequently reprised in the likes of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and steam-punk).Pynchon captures how conflict followed from Imperialism, which followed from Capitalism, which was founded on the separation of labor and capital, as well as male and female.The Interwovenness of DesiresFrom an individual perspective, opposites often attract, if only motivated by the desire to reunite what was once one (\"the secular expressions of a rupture within a single damaged soul\").This is often the most fascinating aspect of Pynchon novels. His early works were ineffably romantic, \"Against the Day\", even more so (fewer characters being truly uneffable).This novel is what I'd call \"anarcho-romantic\", opposing power and master/slave relationships with freedom and equality, both socially and sexually.We shouldn't be wasting our time building wealth for capitalists and imperialists, but punning, playing games and having sex in some new Utopian commonwealth of nations and genders. (I'll give it a go...again!)\nI Heart Yashmeen Halfcourt\nThe Triumph of the NightSex is a major part of \"Against the Day\", as if it's the most obvious activity to engage in at night (when pitted against the day). Pynchon's representation of sex is a product of liberation. It doesn't come attached to any particular configuration of genders, body parts or numerical permutations and combinations, as long as you're having at least one orgasm (each), some fun, a giggle or a look.She is the WorldFor all the sex, this fictional world is just as much a woman's, as a man's, world.Its 70 chapters are a quasi-biblical septuagint. Towards the end, it segued into a nativity story of Yashmeen's Christ-like daughter, Ljubica (literal meaning: love or kiss; violet [see also chaya or etheric double]). However, this is just one of many tales of family, love, romance, passion, flirtation and kissing in the novel.Whereas the focus of \"V.\" was the feminine and \"Gravity's Rainbow\" the masculine, \"Against the Day\" suggests that what is paramount, in the night of the liberated imagination and against the rationalism of the pseudo-illuminated day, is our relationships with each other, including and especially family.Perhaps, at the end of the day, family is even more important than mathematics and science. All we need is love.The Green HourDid I mention food, alcohol and drugs?Meals are intimately described, as if on a menu. The alcohol is as bar-hoppingly diverse as the geographical canvas of the narrative. The drugs reflect the taste of an author born in the 30's writing about the time before his birth.The alcohol and drugs, in particular, enable us to see what is not there, sometimes even what is there but invisible.\"Or, as we like to say, l\u2019heure vertigineuse.\"\"The Absinthe Drinker\" by Viktor OlivaOops, I just realised I hadn't mentioned philately or cricket, the latter of which is the greatest game, the game that witnessed an empire become a commonwealth of sorts.

And there was a comic anarchy in the writing of Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and others. Although I didn't necessarily want to write like them, to someone who's 20 years old that kind of work suggests freedom and possibility. It can make you see not only writing but the world itself in a completely different way...\"Somebody quoted Norman Mailer as saying that he wasn't a better writer because his contemporaries weren't better. I don't know whether he really said that or not, but the point I want to make is that no one in Pynchon's generation can make that statement. If we're not as good as we should be, it's not because there isn't a standard. And I think Pynchon, more than any other writer, has set the standard. He's raised the stakes.\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/1...SOUNDTRACK:\"It's Always Night (or We Wouldn't Need Light)\"[Thelonious Monk quoted in Time Magazine Profile, 1964]http://www.monkzone.com/Profiles_inte...\"It Must Be Always Night, Otherwise They Wouldn't Need the Lights\"The source of the original quote: Thelonius Monk\u2019s advice to saxophonist Steve Lacy (1960)http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/02/th...Thelonious Monk - \"Evidence\", \"Straight, No Chaser\", \"Rhythm-A-Ning\" (Live in Philadelphia on March 3, 1960)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Opt-...Steve Lacy (ss)Charlie Rouse (ts)Thelonious Monk (p)John Ore (b)Roy Haynes (d)Michal Wierba Doppelganger Project - \"It's Always Night (or We Wouldn't Need Light)\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7vXv...Sevil Sabah Quintet - \"Round Midnight\" (Live at Castlemaine Jazz Festival 2015)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud8Gn...The Band -\"Up On Cripple Creek\" (from \"The Last Waltz\")https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDnlU...James Gang - \"Ashes, the Rain and I\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-s73...Blue Oyster Cult - \"Don't Fear the Reaper\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZmr8...\"40,000 men and women every day(Like Romeo and Juliet)40,000 men and women every day(Redefine happiness)Another 40,000 coming every day(We can be like they are).\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM0im...The Beatles - \"All You Need Is Love\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKiqt...

Reading this is like standing on a sideline watching the turn of the century. Pynchon is right there beside you and flipping through the scenes showing you how the common people in that era behaved through his eyes. This is definitely not a history book yet there are real-life characters, e.g., Tesla, Kovaleskaya, and even himself (Pynchon), or real world events, e.g., 1893 Chicago World's Fair, World War I, etc. Still, the bulk of the story is fictional and only uses history as a backdrop. This book is an example of historiographic metafiction or those postmodernist works that are intensely self-reflective and yet paradoxically also claim to historical events and parsonages. (Source: Wiki).Of course, I must admit that I did not understand half of what this book was saying. Yet it is enjoyable because it is different. Pynchon is a bully. He wrote this book to show his talent as a writer. He appeared to me as a boastful (yet he has the right to be) novelist who enjoys writing long novels to prove that he is a cut above the rest. I am different! I am better than you! He, for me, is a modern-day James Joyce; who wrote another book that I did not fully understand and yet I found beautiful: Ulysses. Although this book is more ambitious than that: it's scope is wider (for 1893 to the early 1920's) compared to just a day on Dublin streets. Against the Day also uses contemporary English and yet Pynchon, like Joyce, uses textual play, parody and historical re-conceptualization that are shapeless and almost bereft of emotional impact. Like I said, reading this book is like standing on a side street watching the parade of images passing you by. The images can be blurry (because I am not familiar with those that Pynchon was trying to make fun about) or as sharp as a megapixel photo (because of the way he described them). However, at the end of my reading, they all seem to mix with one another and if I think through the possible theme - that main thin thread that passes through or binds the 1,220 pages - it is nothing but a show. There are many characters with names easy to remember: Sloat (my favorite), Deuce, Yasmeen, Miles, Chick, Lindsay, Randolf, Pugnax, Luca, etc. and yet I know that not one of these will linger in my mind like how Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus made an erasable imprint in my brain as fictional characters.However, what made this unforgettable is the mere fact of reading it. It gave me headache and backache (no book has made my mind swirled as crazy as this) and yet you know that this is brilliancy at its finest. Mediocre novelists definitely don't compare. I mean who among the living writers can compose a beautiful novel with 1,220 pages and small dense prints? Publishers will be wary about the cost of publishing it if there is no guarantee that the book has captured readers. Pynchon has them. This being my 2nd book by him (my first was his thinner book, The Crying of Lot 49) I am happy to say that I will not think twice to someday read his other works like Gravity's Rainbow, V, Vineland and Mason and Dixon. All of them are door-stoppers but sure to be beautiful, well-crafted, first-class door-stoppers."]], "review_count": "539", "description": "Spanning the period between the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at the time of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places not strictly speaking on the map at all.<br /><br />With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead, it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred.<br /><br />The sizable cast of characters includes anarchists, balloonists, gamblers, corporate tycoons, drug enthusiasts, innocents and decadents, mathematicians, mad scientists, shamans, psychics, and stage magicians, spies, detectives, adventuresses, and hired guns. There are cameo appearances by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi, and Groucho Marx.<br /><br />As an era of certainty comes crashing down around their ears and an unpredictable future commences, these folks are mostly just trying to pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it's their lives that pursue them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the author is up to his usual business. Characters stop what they're doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs. Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or two. According to some, this is one of the main purposes of fiction.<br /><br />Let the reader decide, let the reader beware.

I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work.

Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again.

My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place. Fanshawe was there, and no matter how hard I tried not to think of him, I couldn't escape. This was unexpected, galling.

Feels a bit cobbled together, but I'm probably just being picky and petty.In a 4-part book Didion explores the history and narrative of California, and like she is want to do, she kinda clears the table of myths, fables, and stories that people have constructed around place/time. She loves California, but recognizes in that great big state a bunch of contradictions and flaws that seem to be varnished over every couple of years. She loves California but wants it to be loved WITH the flaws, not with the bullshit. This involves a bit of journalistic deconstruction, revisionism, playful teasing, family history, re-reading of her own past writings, thoughts about death and family, property and family, and always, always California (especially Sacramento). Anyway, mediocre, messy, meditative Didion is still pretty damn fantastic."], ["So, so good.

I want to shelve this with the Bridge novels and Son of the Morning Star; Didion and Connell children of the Plains and the Far West, with their doubts and dry wits, sly siblings winking to each other across the mid-century WASP dinner table. (The grandparents settled this west for what reason, at what cost, to establish what kind of culture?) And when she's funny she makes me smile all day: A Thomas Kinkade painting was typically rendered in slightly surreal pastels. It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent coziness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.Of her nonfiction, this is my second-favorite, just behind The White Album."], ["Joan Didion discusses her family and their migration to California. She separates fact from fiction in the stories told, not only about her own family, but also about her native California. Exploring bits and pieces from the 19th century to 21st, readers are treated to well-written essays showing the spirit of true Californians.My favorite essays, of course, were those exploring her own family or which included information on the family of her subjects. Thomas Kincade was the starting point of one of her essays. This one appealed to me because our family usually puts together a puzzle at Christmas, and it is often one based on a Thomas Kincade print.

The last chapter I landed on, about the Spur Posse and the stark reality of a pre-designed faux ownership class called Lakewood, seems to be the best chapter in the book. It was a struggle to get there. I feel odd reviewing a book I only read half of, but take a jab at this if you need to. Correct me if I am wrong. Tell me Joan Didion didn't write a whole book about the underbelly of the California dream and leave out the injustices done to people of color. Tell me it ain't so. Because, as far as I can see, Joan, who is a CA native, wrote this \"expose\" on the great golden state, and seems to feign shock that the westward expansion was less than pleasant, that the water wars and the railway building did not benefit the masses in conception or manifestation. And mostly from the viewpoint of the privelaged. Her book starts with a twisting and turning history of the Sacramento River, dives loosely into the trek from east to west, the railways, etc, etc. We have heard this story. Joan is correct in pointing out that this is usually a glamorized, romantic tale of rugged individualism. She is also correct in pointing out that CA is one of the more dependant states on federal funding in the nation, and has been from the start. She delivers this as if this contrast were some massive epiphany, as if she truly discovered this novel idea. Strcuk gold, if you will.Some how, Didion misses the bulk of CA history. All her stories (or at least half of them) are told from the trite viewpoint of wealthy white men and women. Property owners. Barons. She misses the true injustices that have built CA into the amazing place it is today. I am not asking her to write the story of the Native American, I am not asking her to conjure images of every Chinese man's sweat and blood over the iron tracks they lay, or to pay book length homage to Hispanic families who are the backbone of the agricultural industry in CA- but a nod, a wave from your new Manhattan pedestal Joan! Something. I knew the minute she started this historical account without a mention of the people and land that came before the white \"settlers\" that we were in for a one way perspective ride. Don't trash CA unless you trash it right. Otherwise, you won't see the people who overcame the struggles. That's why CA rocks it."], ["I was raised in California, still live here, and have read Didion all my life. I was thinking of her words on the Santa Ana winds when I finished this book, while a firebug in Los Angeles took advantage of the hot winter weather to set cars on fire across the Westside. Ain't no crazy like a California crazy, I thought; but Joan says it better. We can divide Didion's work into phases: investigative, fictional, and her late work, mostly memoir. I reject the idea that her earlier stuff is somehow stronger: here and in The Year Of Magical Thinking her prose is contemplative and introspective, but also muscular, the way ballet can be.I love Joan Didion. I love her way of writing toward her meaning, and I'm thrilled when she gets there, because her words (and her years) have taken her to a view no one else can describe. In this work, she begins to bind together what it means to live in California: without agenda, standing clear of all attachments her life has offered. Those attachments are many, but she refuses to inhabit them. There's grace in Didion's work: the grace of clarity and distance. It's been decades, and still no one does this better."], ["Joan Didion strikes me as being one of the smartest writers in America, with a firm but quiet authority that makes me trust her absolutely. She is also probably the last social commentator in America who is not shouting with little rivulets of mad-dog spittle flying from the corners of her mouth. Sometimes the book was truly thought-changing for me in not only how I regard California, but how I regard the whole westward expansion aspect of the USA. I live in Fort Wayne, IN \u2013 once the hot center of the military-trading frontier and characterized by all of the usual boondoggles, chicanery, and rapaciousness. To see this carried on to the Golden Gate was a bit depressing \u2013 in fact, by the time we had \u201cexpanded\u201d to California, the federal apparatus had become very sophisticated and prevalent in a way that dwarfs the knee-britches and coonskin cap crudities of Indiana settlement. Damn the railroads. And aero-space. And, er, and thank God for them too, I guess. Whence goeth California, so goeth the country? Ah, but I digress. One of my favorite moments in this book was when one of my favorite military historians, Victor Davis Hansen, a Californian like Didion, and like Didion the product of wealthy pioneer ranch-owning stock, came under Didion\u2019s pitiless gaze. Hansen has long rhapsodized about how he still lives on and to some extent works the ranch, contrasting his rooted-to-the-soil rootedness with the shallow narcissistic lives lead by other Americans. Because of my enormous respect for him, I always took all these things he said as gospel. But Didion calmly and rationally takes Hansen\u2019s supposed pioneering spirit and reduces it to a smoldering pile of historical wishful-thinking. California is and pretty much always has been a heavily subsidized, self-satisfied and self-delusional product of a whole bunch of Federal interference --dam-building and corporate gimmees (first the railroads, then military-avionics, crop subsidies, etc.). The Donner Party had to eat their dead (and not-quite-dead-yets) but once they got to the Golden State, things got a lot easier for many of them. This is a gross simplification of Didion\u2019s calm handling of facts. I was uncomfortable to see Hansen get exposed like this\u2026he rebutted, I presume, somewhere\u2026but Didion did it without getting shrill for even a moment. And her logic, and her facts, seemed dead-on. I mean to read more of Didion\u2019s work\u2026my only (wildly unfair) complaint about her is that she often writes about stuff I don\u2019t give a tinker\u2019s damn about (California, for instance \u2013 although she made me interested finally. But I had to stop reading her book on Miami, so absolutely bogged down and bored I became in the Cuban expat political scene). Sort of like the way the New Yorker\u2019s best writer, Joan Accocela (I spelt that wrong, I know) covers, mostly, dance! But good writing is its own reward. Didion is a master. There is this weird melancholy aspect to her prose that is unique to her \u2013 it lends a gravity to what she writes that is missing in that of most other cultural commentators. She\u2019s one of the few famous contemporary writers I would like to know."], ["In a way, everything Didion wrote led to this book. I think it's one of her best and I sort of consider it the end of the trail, even though her biggest publishing success (\"The Year of Magical Thinking\") was just around the corner. This is Didion's elegiac farewell to California, going back over her life and work and the pioneer myths onto which she had projected so much of her core narrative sensibilities. There's a real scope to it -- collecting a New Yorker piece about the teen sex posse in Lakewood, Calif., and some other California-related pieces for the NYRB -- and then some very good personal work near the end, on the death of her mother, which is in a way more powerful than the grief story told in \"Magical Thinking.\" \"The White Album\" is my favorite Didion book, but this one is a close second."], ["This was a tough book to get through, often dull, frequently depressing. Didion, a Sacramento-area native, examines the myth of the Calfornia Dream. She provides ample evidence that state residents are self-deluded and that their values frequently contradict (ie: believing we are anti-government mavericks, yet being reliant on the DOD for so many jobs). The book is well-researched and accounts of the media coverage of the \"Spur Posse\" and the number of prisons and insane asyllums in the state (that the penal system frequently received more funds than public schools!) are shocking and disturbing. Ultimately, this is a sad wake-up call for those who believe Calfornia is somehow immune to the nation's ills or has been \"ruined\" by \"outsiders.\" The Golden Past is only real in a reminiscier's memory."], ["During college, I heard Joan Didion read from this book. She is a miniscule person with giant glasses, a quiet voice, and a knack for putting words together that really blows me away. I finally got around to reading it. Joan Didion could write a book about plastic bags and I'd still read it, and still probably like it. This topic wasn't something I particularly give a damn about (California history), but her writing is so elegant, understated and thoughtful that I liked it for form over substance"], ["My new friend Chris sent me this book after I took him to Point Reyes for the day. I think I did a pretty good job of convincing him that California is a really nice place to live. He recommended (and sent me) this book - an homage and narrative of the state by one of its most revered writers. It's really fascinating.

This is his first novel and though impressive as a first novel doesn\u2019t really have much to recommend it in my eyes. It\u2019s narrated by an obnoxious filmmaker who heads West to find his creative soul, sort of like a literary road movie. We get lots of snapshots of American life; we also get quite a lot of overwriting and a fair smattering of pretentiousness. A fascinating feature of his books is that they often begin on a more inspired plane than they end. DeLillo loves writing; but he loves writing sentences rather than stories. He\u2019s like Nabokov in the delight he takes in crafting individual sentences. I don\u2019t think any living writer is better at individual sentence writing. I can think of at least four of his novels that begin with stunningly beautiful prose but eventually peter out as if he runs out of that magic elixir, inspiration. At the point where he tries to forge into shape what he\u2019s previously written. DeLillo doesn\u2019t do plots. You could say plot is the discipline at the heart of any novel. It\u2019s probably frustrating at times, like the rules of any game. And it seems to curb DeLillo\u2019s flow. The alternative to plotting a novel is to theme it. Which is what he does but has a tendency to become a bit too esoteric and ambitious, to lose focus. Zero K was probably better unified in terms of theme than some of his earlier novels but the inspired writing was missing. The Names has the inspired writing but the theme becomes ever more oblique and elusive. To be honest I can\u2019t think of much to say about Americana except if you fancy reading him make sure you avoid this one.

This one was a great novel to plunge into, head first (not realling, I knew exactly what I was jumping). Delillo is one of the first, great American, literary novelists who made me WANT to write. I still remember when I was 17 reading MAO II from a small, military library and being absolutely blown away by every paragraph. The novel practically pulsed in my hands. I felt somethhing alive in the words and something that was both dangerous and almost explosive to the touch. Now, almost 25-years later, DeLillo's first novel jumps from a quasi-normal narrative to almost a prose poem, from Mad Men to David Lynch. It is funky, infinitely quotable, and haunting in its strange awareness and paranoia. It is like Don Delillo wanted to describe a documentary of America verbally, but grew unsatisfied in just telling you what he was seeing. Soon, he switched to describing what America was saying/singing. After that he was licking the Acetate off the Super 16 and describing the trip. Funky.

It is like a dream of jubilant gardens in which every tree contains a milky nymph.Don DeLillo\u2019s visions of the present and the future are bleak and he is full of bitterness:\u201cWhat we really want to do, he said, deep in the secret recesses of our heart, all of us, is to destroy the forests, white saltbox houses, covered bridges, brownstones, azalea gardens, big red barns, colonial inns, riverboats, whaling villages, cider mills, waterwheels, antebellum mansions, log cabins, lovely old churches and snug little railroad depots. All of us secretly favor this destruction, even conservationists, even those embattled individuals who make a career out of picketing graceful and historic old buildings to protest their demolition. It\u2019s what we are. Straight lines and right angles. We feel a private thrill, admit it, at the sight of beauty in flames. We wish to blast all the fine old things to oblivion and replace them with tasteless identical structures. Boxes of cancer cells. Neat gray chambers for meditation and the reading of advertisements. Imagine the fantastic prairie motels we could build if only we would give in completely to the demons of our true nature; imagine the automobiles that might take us from motel to motel; imagine the monolithic fifty-story machines for disposing of the victims of automobile accidents without the bother of funerals and the waste of tombstones or sepulchres. Let the police run wild. Let the mad leaders of our nation destroy whomever they choose\u2026\u201dAnd the main character decides to run away and he embarks on his own existential journey\u2026 But there is nowhere to run.Life seems to be full of events but it all is but froth\u2026 Just a light blow of the wind and there will be nothing left but emptiness\u2026 \u201cWe have learned not to be afraid of the dark but we\u2019ve forgotten that darkness means death.\u201d And the yawning emptiness will devour you."], ["A Polished Set of PietiesMy first experience of the DeLillo-Rama was \n\"The Names\"\n and until now I had only read one of the earlier novels - \"Great Jones Street\" - though I was trying to keep up with the later novels.Little did I realise what a gem was waiting for me in \"Americana\", DeLillo's first novel.It's 377 pages long, divided into four parts and 12 chapters, but it reads as fluently as a novel two-thirds its size.Its relative brevity doesn't detract from its ability to explore or dramatise profound concerns. As the narrator, David Bell says of his own writing in a film script:\"Large issues will begin to manifest themselves out of the dull set of pieties I've been constructing here. This is not easy work for me.\"It took DeLillo four years to write this novel. I'd say his reservations must have been more formal than stylistic, because the quality of the sentences is never less than exemplary.Four PartsWhile DeLillo is regarded as a Post-Modernist author, in this case it's more overtly because of his subject matter than his structural approach.The four parts of the novel do however let in some scope for metafictional play:Part One paints a self-portrait of David Bell as a vain (\u201cI was an extremely handsome young man\u201d) 28 year old producer for a New York based television network. There's plenty of corporate rivalry, sexual flirtation, prurient gossip and mutual suspicion. DeLillo totally nails the speech patterns of this subculture.Part Two returns to Bell's childhood, and his relationship with his legendary advertising exec father, his socialite mother, and his two sisters, Mary and Jane.In Part Three David absconds from work to make a semi-documentary, semi-autobiographical film in the Mid-West, which causes him to miss his engagement on a documentary project about the Navaho people in Arizona for his network.Part Four sees David continue his road trip westward to California, after which much later (possibly 1999) he is living in isolation on an island (rather than the continent of North America) where he finishes an autobiographical novel (possibly this novel?).Part Dream, Part Fiction, Part MoviesThe film script gives David an opportunity to write about himself in dialogue form. So DeLillo creates the narrator David Bell, who then uses fictional friends, colleagues and actors to dramatise his own life and elaborate on the issues that preoccupy both himself and DeLillo. It's a nice touch of metafiction that doesn't distract or detract from the psychological realism of the novel as a whole:\u201cI'm thinking of making a long messy autobiographical-type film, part of which I'd like to do out here in the Midwest, if that's where we are - a long unmanageable movie full of fragments of everything that's part of my life, maybe ultimately taking two or three or more full days to screen and only a minutely small part of which I'd like to do out here. Pick out some sleepy town and shoot some film.\u201dAfter a while, the novel takes the form of the film, the movie\u2019s style influences the structure and style of the novel. Maybe the book is the real motion picture:\u201cThe illusion of motion was barely relevant. Perhaps it wasn't a movie I was making so much as a scroll, a delicate bit of papyrus that feared discovery...It takes centuries to invent the primitive.\u201dBell describes the film in terms that apply equally to the novel:\u201cWhat I'm doing is kind of hard to talk about. It's a sort of first-person thing but without me in it in any physical sense, except fleetingly. It'll be part dream, part fiction, part movies. An attempt to explore parts of my consciousness.\u201dThe Rumble of Public OpinionThe network places Bell at the heart of mass culture as at 1971. He regards television as \"an electronic form of packaging\" for the products that the network\u2019s sponsors are advertising. He and his colleagues depend on sponsorship and advertising sales for the continuity of their programs and their status within the organisation. They have \"orchestrated their lives to the rumble of public opinion,\" the emotional response of the crowd.David's independent film is both an escape from the corporate crowd and a rebellion against mass culture, \u201cthe larger madness\u201d. In contrast to television:\"The film is a sort of sub-species of the underground.\"Modernist Literary and Filmic PrecursorsThe novel is shot through with references to modernists like James Joyce, Antonioni, Samuel Beckett and Godard, especially \u201cUlysses\u201d:\u201cMollycuddling my bloomless bride\u201d; and\u201cI've got the Stephen Dedalus Blues and it's a long way to Leopoldville.\u201dA Leap Too FarIn Part Four, David encounters a community of hippies who are sharing accommodation with some self-exiled Apache Indians who have refused to embrace the life of ranchers.Their leader believes in aliens and flying saucers, which proves to be a leap too far for David, and he moves on. He\u2019s not yet ready to surrender to all aspects of the American counter-culture. His is a more individual and personal journey. It\u2019s religious, almost sacred to him.Westward to the Wilderness DreamIt\u2019s hinted at the end of the novel that David returns to New York City to resume his participation in mainstream culture, even though his absence during the film project means that he has lost his job.Only later does he end up on the island, where he wrote his book.It\u2019s hard to tell just how ingrained the mainstream is in his consciousness. The individual is overwhelmed by the multifarious images and dreams of commercial culture and advertising:\u201c...the mightiest of the visionaries [were] those strong enough to confront the larger madness. For the rest of us, the true sons of the dream, there was only complexity. The dream made no allowance for the truth beneath the symbols, for the interlinear notes, the presence of something black (and somehow very funny) at the mirror rim of one's awareness...but as a boy, and even later, all the impulses of all the media were fed into the circuitry of my dreams. One thinks of echoes. One thinks of an image made in the image and likeness of images. It was that complex.\u201dIt was so complex that David had to escape from his reality by heading into the west, ironically a source of new and different dreams (\u201cwestward to the wilderness dream... to match the shadows of my image and my self\u201d):\u201cI'm trying to outrun myself.\u201d\u201cI've spent twenty-eight years in the movies...\u201d\u201cIt is so much simpler to bury reality than it is to dispose of dreams.\u201dDeLillo seems to be arguing that the dreams of the crowd cause the death of individuals, their reality and their possibilities. Society had become a \"death machine\" and television had become its \u201cfestival of death\u201d, a \u201cdeath circus\u201d.The world might remain a mystery, but DeLillo\u2019s fiction has become a guidebook of sorts that directs us to pockets of life and individuality, and just perhaps a mirror that reflects our own.May 29, 2016"], ["Here is a song for this review. I like the original better, but this cover isn't too shabby either:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX7QAn...I'm going to throw out an idea. Maybe it's not really a good one, or true or maybe it's something that's obvious, which all of the above are probably the case for most of my ideas but here it goes: when you get right down to it, America is a country without history. Instead we're a nation of stories and myths. We have the stories of the founding fathers that people like Glen Beck cry over, we're white-washers of what Manifest Destiny entailed a la Rush Limbaugh on his day before Thanksgiving show of his past year, we're glorifiers of larger than life figures like Big Bill Haywood and Alexander Berkman (I don't want to leave the radicals out of my theory here). As a general consensus we mythologize. This is nothing new, just looking at writers from the early part of the 20th Century like Sinclair Lewis and Sherwood Anderson we see the lie of middle America torn apart. We see the good moral backbone of our country exposed as being as vapid as the coasts (which we already knew to be cesspools, those immigrants soiling our soil). In our hearts I like to think we all know that there is no mythical 'America', that the heartland isn't pure, that westward path isn't an escape from anything. That the same hardships, the same bullshit, the same whatever you want to call it, is here and there and everywhere. Maybe it is just called something different. Not that things can't be better somewhere, but there is only another here. I'm going to ignore those lost young souls of middle America who come East to populate places like Brooklyn and free themselves from the provincialism of wherever they are from. Maybe they do find something better, we all have the chance of finding somewhere better. Those people aren't looking for America anyway, they are looking for a city. America isn't the coastal cities. At a certain point maybe most of us buy into the story of going West (which ever way West actually is). Maybe it's hardcoded into our DNA, since those of us of European descent are mostly all the descendants of people who packed it up and moved to the 'unknown' New World because they couldn't cut it where they were from for one reason or another. Happy successful people don't just pull up stakes and go to a totally foreign place to live the rest of their lives, severing ties, start afresh. Miscreants, dreamers, those unhappy with their lot in life, failures, the oppressed, people who have lives that are so awful that a big gamble on something new is better than what they are living in, rubes fooled by silly stories of streets paved with gold these are our forefathers. Not that I'm passing judgement. It makes me wonder if we aren't a nation of people that dissatisfaction is something we've inherited, and now we have no farther to really go. No more unchartered lands to explore. But coupled with the dissatisfaction are the larger than life stories of America. The stories that some of us can't live up to. Comparing ourselves to the stories we learn as history our own lives can be seen as failures. I don't know if any of this is making sense. In the post-WWII times going West, leaving the confines of the rigid East Coast is in a way synonymous with finding one self, with finding something more authentic. It's the lure of that schmuck Kerouac, that the real life is somewhere out there on the open road, in the purer towns, or whatever you think is out there that is not here. As if there is someplace that the real you can be found, at some Burning Man hippie bullshit Rainbow Festival or whatever better city or more real experience there is out there. Americana is an anti-On The Road. It's a journey of a fairly despicable protagonist, who is an almost Patrick Bateman like vacuum of a person (minus the ultra-violence towards anyone) who takes a cross country trip to 'find' himself through a trip through small town America and making a movie about himself. That is the quick plot overview of the book. I got to an impasse here. I had no idea what to write so I went to the grocery store. On the way I stepped on some black ice at the corner and fell. A man was behind me and instead of offering me a hand or even a word like, are you ok, or even walk around me he stepped right over me, lightly kicking. I stood up and called him a fucking asshole and he scurried across the street. I wanted him to slip on some ice himself and then maybe have a taxi or a bus run him over. I was thinking then when I was in the grocery store that this is the kind of thing that people think of when they think of New York and the kind of scene in a movie where the guy would then say, that's it I'm through with rude assholes, were moving to the country. And I thought of a winter about 15 years ago (wow that just made me feel really old), when I was living at home and delivering pizza. My parents were away, driving my sister down to school in North Carolina and we had a shit ton of snow. Like over a foot, and I had no idea how to use the snow plower, or maybe it was broken, we always seemed to have broken snow plowers back in those days. And I had to go to work so I went outside to dig my way out of the driveway. The plow had come by fairly recently so there was a big wall of snow at the end of the driveway that was kind of packed and heavy. Across the street was our elderly neighbor out with his snow blower. I was shoveling and kind of hoping he'd offer to help me with his snow blower, but I wasn't expecting it. Now this isn't the kind of heartwarming story about the man who lived in the country / now suburbs his whole life doing something nice. Instead at one point started to clear off an area that it was close enough to send all of the snow shooting right on to me. He could have moved the shooting thing to aim another direction but he didn't. Instead over and over again he kept shooting snow right at me, oblivious like (or I think it was oblivious). Two incidents of people being inconsiderate assholes in two different locales (of course there are lots of incidents of people being nice in both locales, but I'm in an annoyed / depressed mood right now so I won't talk about them). Return to talking about the book Greg. I'm not sure what to write about the book. Parts of it were really depressing to me, but not in any way I can put my finger easily on. The book is about 'finding yourself' but with the realization that finding yourself is always a pointless task since you're always right there with all the baggage and shit that comes with you. But that is cheapening the book, it's about much more than that. I really really liked this book. There were parts I didn't care for too much, but overall it was a great read. It has the energy and immediacy of a great first novel, where it is like the author is trying to jam as many themes and ideas into the pages of his book as possible, because he might not ever get another chance to get everything out. But he's not too heavy handed with everything he is trying to get across, some of the great subtly that is in his later work is already present here. There is something about the work that feels like it fits in with his latest book Point Omega, but it's not nearly as sparse and feels more like a young man instead of an older man's novel. I feel like there is a lot I want to say about this novel, but words are failing me and even the internal words that make up the never-ending inner-monologe in my head are faltering too. I want to read this book again at some point. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone though, there is too much of a chance that what I like about it so much is outside of the actual words on the page and that it's just the way the text touches on to my own thoughts that made me like it so much."], ["It seems that this has only entered the pop culture discourse as a sort of proto-American Psycho, based around the idea that its first segment is about the shallow nature of corporate America and the personality-free drones that make their fortunes within the confines of that system. I don't quite agree with that, because I think it ignores two key interlocking facets of this novel. For one, the \"office politics\" segment only lasts about a hundred pages, before David Bell (who most would hold as this novel's Bateman) hits the road. Secondly, Bell hits the fucking road. Bateman is content to ride the wave, to keep up with his double-life as corporate executive and mass murderer. Bell wants more than Bateman, wants more than to be a shallow, personality-free drone, and I think that makes him a more complex and therefore interesting character than Bateman. Then again, I prefer DeLillo to Ellis by a long shot, so what're you gonna do.Anyway, Americana is DeLillo's first novel, and it's astounding how much of his act he had figured out from the beginning. Like the man's more famous later works, it's haunted by the idea of death, features mass media heavily, and is full of deliberately awkward exchanges that might be off-putting to some but are hilarious and endearing to me. It's also more of a \"concept novel,\" per se, than a \"plot novel.\" DeLillo is that sort of author, after all. It also introduces his idea of using childhood events as motivators for later actions, a concept explored to its fullest in his two best novels, Libra and Underworld, and even has a bit of White Noise's suburban satire and Mao II's crowd dynamics. Granted, Ratner's Star also tried to do a lot of these things, but this book seems either more confident, more within DeLillo's early abilities, or both.Of course, there are downsides. Bell still isn't as terrific of a character as some of the fascinating people DeLillo would go onto develop, the desert island subplot is sort of useless, and the whole last act could probably have been done without. Despite all that, it's still a fine first novel that deserves to be remembered on its own steam and not just in relation to another, more famous book. I'm now a little more excited about early DeLillo than I was when I read Ratner's Star."], ["Just really unbelievable that he can get away with so blatant and heavy a freudian plot point. Along with the iron-fisted relationships drawn between flashback and present action. All of it. The disastrous last act, the disastrous bookend premise of the narrator's presence. And still, STILL, a book everyone should read, especially everyone who wants to write a novel, because here is a masterful author's uniquely unmasterful first stab, since esteemed as a masterpiece for its sheer unmasterfulness.

Eliot to Wallace Stevens), suffered many tragedies. His mother died when he was just five years old, but in 1879 the cruelest blow of all struck when his beloved son Anatole died at the age of eight. <em>A Tomb for Anatole</em> presents the 202 fragments of Mallarme's projected long poem in four parts. By far the poet's most personal work, he could never bring himself to complete it. To speak publicly of his immense sorrow, Mallarme concluded, \"for me, it's not possible.\" Unpublished in France until 1961, these works are very far from the oblique, cool \"pure poetry\" Mallarme is famous for, poetry that sought to capturepainstakingly\"<em>l'absente de tous bouquets</em>\" (the ideal flower absent from all bouquets). Paul Auster, who first published <em>A Tomb for Anatole</em> with the North Point Press in 1983 (a volume long out of print), notes in his excellent introduction that facing \"the ultimate horror of every parent,\" these fragments \"have a startling unmediated quality.\" As Mallarme writes, it is \"a vision / endlessly purified / by my tears.\"", "author": "St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9"}, "Amazons: An Intimate Memoir by the First Woman Ever to Play in the National Hockey League": {"average_rating": "3.61", "review": [["It should come as no surprise that David Foster Wallace's archive at University of Texas' Harry Ransom Center contains Wallace's annotated copy of Amazons.

The thing that immediately stood out to me about Amazons is how strong an influence it must have been on Wallace's first novel, The Broom Of The System. Some of the dialogue here is strikingly similar and the rational and overwhelmed central female protagonist, Lenore Beadsman, struggling through a world of neurotic men in Wallace's novel seems heavily based on Cleo Birdwell and her many suitors.This is an excellent book, laugh-out-loud funny, and the best of the five or six DeLillo novels I've read.

What the book is mostly about is men who are surrounded by other men in what is basically a testosterone/masculinity contest seeking out the warmth and tenderness of a woman who can give them a reprieve from that: most of these men are scumbags. there is also a massive subplot about the distinction between sickness and health and that arbitrariness of disease. in some ways this novel is remarkable, and in some ways it is really dull. out of print, unfortunately, but worth reading if you can get your hands on it."], ["Pretty damn hilarious. Don DeLillo must have had a lot of fun with this one."], ["\"Cleo's in a pretty unique position.\"That's the first line of the back-cover copy. I like it better as an intro than the oft-quoted first line of the book: \"If a man's name sounds right whether you say it forwards or backwards, it means he went to Yale.\" Cleo is referring there to a man named Sanders Meade, one of the many strange men vying for her attention.You might wonder who an avowed sports cipher (I try to watch sports, it's just...nothing sticks) why I'd read a memoir about the first woman to play in the National Hockey League. You might wonder until you realize 1. it's a novel, not a memoir, and 2. it's by Don Delillo, not \"Cleo Birdwell.\"There you go. Now it all makes sense.Because I dedicated myself a year and a half ago to reading all of Delillo's novels (we'll....we'll see about the plays), I had to go deep, and that included a book that he wrote under an assumed name and has since had officially expunged from his bibliography. It's long out of print, and you have to be pretty watchful to find a reasonably-priced copy, but I gotta say, it's worth the hunt! (If you need further professional/literary verification that it's good, it's received high marks from both Jonathan Lethem and David Foster Wallace, whose annotated copy of Amazons can be found amongst his papers. Also, here's a cool article about Amazons by an author named Victoria Patterson, who wrote her own contemporary female-led fictitious sports memoir and her relationship to Delillo's book: http://www.theweeklings.com/vpatterso...)As the lurid cover suggests, this is a relatively steamy (by Delillo standards) book about a female hockey player in a man's world. She's from the small town of Badger, OH, and she's pretty canny and smart and reads the works of the philosopher Wadi Assad (author of The Mystic Prince I, The Barefoot Rose, or The Romance of Being). I mean, most of the team (and a share of her paramours) are reading Assad, too. But still, she seems to understand it better than them.This to me felt like the second part of a two-part investigation Delillo was conducting in the late '70s in which he was trying to write fully-formed female characters that were also sexually open without being a one-dimensional male fantasy. Moll in Running Dog is definitely Cleo's predecessor here. She jumped from situation to situation while still keeping her eye on the investigation, having fun and goin' for hers without having to be punished for it, or being regretful for not going with Mr. Right or whatever. Cleo has enough sex in this to make Southern's Candy blush, but without being thrown around by forces beyond her control. It helps that Cleo is smart and canny, but her guy suitors are in no way her equal. Some are sweet, some mean well, but many of them (especially the aforementioned Sanders Meade) don't realize how lucky (or broken) they are.Amazons is a well-written sex farce in the classic style. One male after another tries to seduce Ms. Birdwell throughout her first season with the Philadelphia Rangers, but none of them seem up to the task. Cleo's agent, the perpetually nervous Floss Penrose, has a new tennis protege named Archie Brewster, who is always jetlagged and consents to regularly playing Strip Monopoly with Floss. Cleo tries to lure him away, but he falls asleep; she has to drag him to her room by throwing him on an area rug and dragging it like Edmund Hilary up the stairs. Then there's Shaver Stevens, an ex-hockey man himself and very much Cleo's equal. Sadly, he's afflicted with a hazy, hard to cure ailment called Jumping Frenchman Disease. He's later put into sleep state with a machine called a Kramer box for six months, hoping that his body will work itself out after six months of R&R. Then there's Sanders Meade, the Yale man with the interchangeable name. He wants to do it in the worst way, but certain subjects turn him off. One is the member of a certain member of the team -- Eric Torkleson, whose praiseworthy penis has been named Torkle by everyone else on the team. An ill-timed mention of \"Torkle\" sends Sanders into a shame spiral. The other is \"the twin spectres of Vietnam and Watergate,\" to use his own words. Then there's sportswriter Murray Jay Siskind, who eagle-eyed Delillo readers will remember is Jack Gladney's colleague in White Noise, a \"visiting lecturer on living icons.\" (He and Jack pace the floor while comparing Elvis and Hitler.) He can barely control himself while Cleo describes her bucolic, quintessentially Midwestern upbringing in Badger, Ohio especially the traditions of Christmas night. Tell me about the carolers again. No...slower.....The book is full of weird little storylines like this. Murray Jay is thinking about quitting sportswriting because of his new obsession, a story guaranteed to blow the lid off, as old newspaperman might say: it's an expose about how the snowmobile industry is entirely Mafia-run. Then there's James Kinross, the owner of the team who would rather tell Cleo about all his violent hyjinks as a youth then chase her around the office: \"Anyone come into our neighbourhood, we\u2019d crack their fuggin heads open. I opened more heads than a brain surgeon. We used to break aerials offa cars and use them for weapons. Swish swish. Whip one of them things across somebody\u2019s face, he\u2019s gonna be looking at glass eyes on a jeweller\u2019s tray. We used entire steering wheels. We ripped entire steering wheels out of cars. All our weapons came from cars, except for rocks. Not lot many cars have rocks for parts. Our rocks came from empty lots. We used to have rock fights at point-blank range in empty lots. You wouldn\u2019t believe the blood, the guys out cold, the guys staggering around holding their open heads\u2014it was fuggin urban mayhem.\"As you might have gathered, Amazons is Delillo's funniest book by far. Really funny, not just \"oh, how droll.\" Well, it's both, actually. It's funny like this: \"I reached up with my right hand and grabbed the hair at the back of his head and just jerked the whole mass of hair, skull, and flesh back out of my face. It was like pulling a toy arrow with a rubber suction up off a wall. It made a noise that sounded like Platt, Utah, although I don\u2019t know if there is such a place.\" and it's droll like this:\"If the president is described as looking fit and trim, or trim and fit, it means he has had a good night\u2019s sleep, he has had some fresh-squeezed orange juice upon awakening, and we have not lost further leverage in the Horn, the Rim, the Gulf, or the Corridor overnight. After presidential vacations, trim and fit becomes tanned and fit. This is automatic. Either way, it is a term I associate with people who have enough money to be happily obese, out of shape, and generally wasted, jowly, and dissipated, out drinking and screwing every night, but who have resolved to be fit and trim out of a deep sense of duty. In other words, fitness and trimness are moral qualities, and when the president is described as being fit and trim, we should all feel better. Power has its darker side, of course, and this same president will be described two days alter as looking tired and drawn. This isn\u2019t so bad. When he is called pale and haggard, however, or grey and shaken, he is having problems right down the line, personal and otherwise. Weary and beat means the job is just too much for him, and if you read that he is looking haunted and ashen, it probably means he is getting ready to board Air Force One for the ultimate scenario.\"Then there's this, a perfect summation of made-for-TV movies circa 1980:\"Natasha was watching a movie made for TV. It had that glossy look. They spritz the whole set with hair spray. The actors have carved faces and move about on casters. Every third shot is a zoom into a frightened woman\u2019s teeth.\"The book takes the occasional dark turn, and it's pretty long for a humor book, but it's got a far better hit ratio than I expected. The one clunker joke/thing is in the last third of the book, when a Saudi sheik buys the team and initiates compulsory 4 a.m. bed checks. They go even further by demanding that Cleo wear a veil the next season. Very \"Up the Academy,\" minus ensuing hijinx. I guess it's not for me as a dude to declare that another dude did a really good job writing a woman who is both sexually active but also dignified, so I'll leave that for my lady friends who might want to give this a try and decide for themselves. I liked it, I thought it erred on the right side of the equation -- making the dudes lunks rather than her a sexual naif -- while still keeping her flawed and intriguing. It's also a damn sight sexier than that awful sex scene in Americana. Do you need to read this? Unless you're a Delillo obsessive, maybe not, and honestly, the scarcity of it doesn't make your decision that hard. If you do come upon a copy, though, I'd say go for it -- it's a nice harbinger of the more humorous and humane side that came out in White Noise, while being a far faster and more straightforward read -- no pondering over architecturally jaw-clenching sentences here. It's fast and loose and kooky and a lot of fun."], ["I would say I was definitely interested in reading Don DeLillo writing a memoir about the first woman to play in the NFL. And there are parts of it that are great-- weird turns of phrase and some lovely sentences, flashes of his \"big\" themes, especially those that crop up in books like _White Noise_, for example, ideas about health and medicine (I wish there was a whole series of medical mysteries, a la the novels of Robin Cook, that DeLillo had written). Some stuff about consumerism, some about consumer churn. A lot about NYC, and a lot of broad pastiche about places that aren't NYC.But the book as a whole is kind of an eh. I didn't expect it to be serious, but I didn't expect to be bored or find the last seventy-five pages of section two tedious, and I kind of did. There are striking moments throughout, but some of them-- especially the cross-cutting between sex and monologues, while funny at the level of concept, maybe didn't totally work as executed.I'm glad I read it, but completely understand why some others who read it don't push it on everyone else."], ["Strange how Don DeLillo's distanced himself from Amazons, which, with its deadpan asides, repetitions, absurd interactions and set pieces, uniquely foregrounds his comic approach.

No? She was supposedly the first woman to play hockey in the NHL and \u201cAmazons\u201d is her supposed memoir. Funny thing is though, it was actually written by Don DeLillo in the early 80\u2019s right around the same time as one of his most famous novels, \u201cWhite Noise.\u201d As a matter of fact, sportswriter character Murray Jay Siskind actually appears in both works.Why does DeLillo refuse to acknowledge writing this in any of his official bibliographies and why hasn\u2019t he allowed it to be republished since its initial release? Your guess is as good as mine, but the fact that it is not easily available to the masses is tragic because it\u2019s one of his best efforts.If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Don DeLillo, most of his body of work tackles heavy topics such as nuclear war, global terrorism, mathematics, 9/11, and the Kennedy assassination. \u201cAmazons\u201d however is something altogether different; it\u2019s a comic masterpiece that addresses the average American\u2019s two greatest obsessions: sports and sex.As previously mentioned, \u201cAmazons\u201d is the tale of Cleo Birdwell, supposedly the first woman to play hockey in the NHL. We follow her exploits, narrated by her, over the course of an entire season. When she\u2019s not playing hockey, which is for most of the book, she\u2019s sleeping with just about everyone who is somehow connected to the team. Each guy she hooks up with though, has his own, strange, fucked up thing when it comes to sex. One gets flaccid at the sound of the word \u201cWatergate,\u201d one can only get aroused by giving long speeches in French, one has jumping Frenchmen disease (yes, this is actually a real thing), one has to be told tales of small town America in order to become aroused, the list actually goes on and on. Our Cleo may be great on the ice, but she\u2019s even better between the sheets.Personally, my favorite thing about DeLillo as an author is the way he writes conversations and his ability to make beautiful the smallest of seemingly meaningless moments. Reading \u201cAmazons\u201d was like taking those best bits from any serious DeLillo novel, turning them on their head so they become over the top in their absurdity, and then inserting them into a comedy. Simply put it shouldn\u2019t work at all, but it does perfectly.I\u2019m jonesing for an entire Cleo Birdwell series of novels. I want some up and coming \u201cdocumentary\u201d filmmaker to turn this thing into a mega movie franchise (though it may end up being a little too NC-17\u2026). It\u2019s hard for me to do because it\u2019s so hilarious, but I have to admit that after \u201cWhite Noise\u201d this novel is my favorite thing DeLillo\u2019s ever done."], ["This was clearly DeLillo's guilty pleasure book. That's fine except that the guilt was well earned. It's just not a very good book. Yes, there are a few funny moments of social satire and a few characteristic metafictive reflections; however, they're just too few and far between. My biggest disappointment was that he didn't do more to mimic and/or play with the \"fake memoir\" form. After the first few pages, there was barely a mention of it being a memoir (or of it acting like a memoir). Really, a few pages in, it simply began to read like a standard first-person novel. The memoir ruse was all but gone as I read further into the book. Furthermore, there's much to be said (too much to get into here) about how masculinist the supposed female viewpoint here tends to be. All in all, I suppose I understand why DeLillo has yet to claim Cleo Birdwell. Apparently, he was writing this at the same time as White Noise, and it's clear that he made the right call as to which book to put his name on."]], "review_count": "3", "description": "This book was written by Don DeLillo under the pseudonym of Cleo Birdwell. In this fictional memoir, Birdwell plays for the New York Rangers hockey team and relates her experiences as the team's goaltender.", "author": "Cleo Birdwell"}, "In the Country of Last Things": {"average_rating": "3.90", "review": [["Post-Apocalyptic ApocryphaI don\u2019t normally seek out post-apocalyptic novels, but Paul Auster\u2019s novel is one to treasure.Even though it is an early work, I felt I was in the hands of a master.It is both beautifully written and wise.It\u2019s easy to read, but it\u2019s not so easily \u201creadable\u201d that I could read it without turning the telly off.Although its style is sparse and economical, there\u2019s a lot happening beneath the surface.Still, Auster carefully manages exactly how much he wants us to know and what he wants to remain unclear or open for conjecture.This transforms the reader into a literary detective, a sifter of clues and memories.Anna\u2019s Epistle to An Unnamed FriendThe story is told in the voice of 19 year old Anna Blume in the form of a long letter to a friend who isn\u2019t identified (but might be a little sister or a childhhod friend).The letter is a summary of her time in a post-apocalyptic city, written hurriedly in the last days before she expects to escape it illegally.I\u2019m not sure how appropriate or successful the epistolary format was.There is only one long 190 page letter written in a blue notebook, not an exchange of correspondence. We only get one point of view. It could just as readily have been a journal, apart from the fact that it\u2019s addressed to one particular person.A Letter Never Sent?Was her letter ever sent?It\u2019s not clear whether the letter was ever delivered or read. It's quite possible that it wasn't.This could be an inevitable consequence of the choice of epistolary format.Normally, this format would dictate that the novel must work internally within the letter.We can only assume that someone \u201cfound\u201d or received it, even if it wasn\u2019t the addressee for whom it was intended.However, in the first few pages, there are some clues.Phrases like \u201dshe wrote\u201d and \u201cher letter continued\u201d are interposed into the letter.Perhaps, they are intended to suggest that somebody other than we readers might have found the letter and read it, if not necessarily the addressee.However, ultimately, whether or not it was read by the right person, Auster implicitly makes the point that it was worth writing (if only because ultimately he wrote it!).An Incomprehensible ApocalypseAs you would expect, Paul Auster doesn\u2019t tell us a lot about the nature of the Apocalypse itself. It\u2019s cloaked in mystery.The novel is more concerned with its aftermath.Anna Blume arrived in the city by foreign charity ship, 12 months after the Apocalypse occurred.She comes from a different country to the east, possibly England.There are opportunities to reveal where she comes from (presumably she has a foreign accent, but nobody comments on it; Victoria, one of the people she meets on the way, has sent her children to England to escape the Apocalypse, but they don't appear to discuss this common interest).It seems strange that nothing is made of these opportunities to disclose her origins, although Anna might not have thought them important enough.A Report Never FiledAnna is looking for her older brother, William, a journalist who had previously come to report on the events for a newspaper, but has since gone missing.It\u2019s not clear how much reporting has got through to the rest of the world. Not much by the sound of it.A Collapse of Epidemic ProportionsOnly when Anna has been in the city for some time does she learn that:\"...some kind of epidemic had broken out there. The city government had come in, walled off the area, and burned everything down to the ground.\"Or so the story went. I have since learned not to take the things I am told too seriously.\"It\u2019s not that people make a point of lying to you, it\u2019s just that where the past is concerned, the truth tends to get obscured rather quickly.\u201cLegends crop up within a matter of hours, tall tales circulate, and the facts are soon buried under a mountain of outlandish theories.\"It\u2019s not clear whether the epidemic was the primary cause of the Apocalypse or whether it was an after-effect.Auster refers to the Apocalypse occasionally as a \u201ccollapse\u201d, which suggests that it might have been just as much a social phenomenon, as a natural or even man-made disaster, though there is some sense of past destruction and imminent war.He also mentions \u201cthe Troubles\u201d, which were violent political disputes, although it\u2019s unclear whether they preceded or followed the Apocalypse.Whatever the physical cause of the Apocalypse, it\u2019s clear that not only have many buildings collapsed, but the social order of the city has collapsed into barely-controlled anarchy.Like the surviving inhabitants, readers have to piece together the clues, and even then it isn\u2019t clear how reliable they are. The City of DestructionAuster does not name the city in the novel, although many consider it to be New York.It contains a National Library, but I doubt whether it is intended to be Washington, because it seems to be a port, and we learn that there is nothing on the same continent east of it.None of the street names are recognisable, although \u201cCircus Street\u201d might just be Broadway.Even though Anna comes from a place that has been unaffected, she lacks knowledge about the continent that the city is on.Again, she has to rely on what she has been told:\"This country is enormous, you understand, and there\u2019s no telling where he might have gone. Beyond the agricultural zone to the west, there are supposedly several hundred miles of desert. Beyond that, however, one hears talk of more cities, of mountain ranges, of mines and factories, of vast territories stretching all the way to a second ocean.\"Whether or not this is America, why doesn\u2019t she seem to have greater knowledge of the continent? Has the knowledge of the rest of the world been affected as well?Wide is the Gate and Broad is the RoadSome clues as to the scope and design of the novel can be found in the epigram:\"Not a great while ago, passing through the gate of dreams, I visited that region of earth in which lies the famous City of Destruction.\"Nathaniel Hawthorne This quotation comes from Hawthorne\u2019s short story, \u201cThe Celestial Railroad\u201d, which is an allegory about the people of a city who try to build a shortcut between their own city and Heaven, between \u201cThe City of Destruction\u201d and \u201cThe Celestial City\u201d.Hawthorne based his story on John Bunyan\u2019s \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u201d, the full title of which is \u201cThe Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come\u201d.Both works are concerned with the proper way to get to Heaven, which is itself described in the Bible:\"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.\" Matthew 7:13-14A Secular Pilgrim's ProgressThe novel isn\u2019t overtly Christian or religious (even though Anna describes herself as Jewish). However, there is an underlying morality at work.Without any obvious clues, there\u2019s a sense that the city was doing something \"wrong\", that it had started to step out too confidently and aggressively for its own good, that it deserved to decline and fall, and therefore that it had it coming to it.Perhaps, it\u2019s been punished for being immoral, greedy and inconsiderate, if not necessarily being irreligious.In the wake of the Apocalypse, there\u2019s a sense in which humanity has to reconstruct itself without the aid of institutional religion.After her arrival, Anna is quickly reduced to the level of a local inhabitant.She has to make her way back to virtue, happiness and fulfilment, and her letter describes a secular pilgrimage of sorts.The Getting of WisdomAnna has to piece together every resource available to her, whether spiritual or worldly, to survive.In the process, she gains some awareness, knowledge and wisdom, even if it could be taken away from her at any moment.She starts by describing issues of subsistence, the hunger from which everyone suffers:\"You must get used to doing with as little as you can. By wanting less, you are content with less, and the less you need, the better off you are.\"That is what the city does to you. It turns your thoughts inside out. It makes you want to live, and at the same time it tries to take your life away from you.\"Out of OrderThen she describes the social structures that have emerged to fill the void left by the Apocalypse: Runners, Leapers, Smilers, Crawlers, Dreamers, Fecalists, Resurrection Agents, Vultures, Tollists.Where there is no longer any authority, there is now desperate tribalism, bare aggression and raw power.Sickness prevails. Death is everywhere.Even within the confines of the Library, many of the books have been stolen for fuel.Those that remain have been scattered all over the floor.They are \"out of order\" and therefore useless.Like everybody else, Anna is left to her own devices. Or almost.Populating the CityHaving set the scene, Anna introduces the people she has allowed into her life in the city.She makes friends and loses them, whether to death or fate or circumstance.Still, the company of others gives her both love and hope, if only temporarily.Every act of friendship is more valuable, given the circumstances in which it occurs.At times, it seems that the novel is an allegory about the Holocaust, where even in the worst and most evil of conditions the beauty of humanity can still shine through.Eventually, her band of accomplices resolves itself down to the comforting Sam Farr (who she had hoped would lead her to William), the charitable Victoria Woburn (who maintains a hospital in memory of her father) and the eccentric Boris Stepanovich.A Persona of Indifference Becomes a Persona of BenevolenceAnna and Sam start a relationship, only to be parted, without knowing whether the other is alive.Sam hibernates:\"I gave up trying to be anyone. The object of my life was to remove myself from my surroundings, to live in a place where nothing could hurt me anymore. One by one, I tried to abandon my attachments, to let go of all the things I ever cared about. The idea was to achieve indifference, an indifference so powerful and sublime that it would protect me from further assault. I said good-bye to you, Anna...\"Yet one day, he stumbles into Victoria\u2019s hospital where Anna is now working.Reunited at last, he takes on the role of doctor, and the patients start to trust him with their problems:\"It was like being a confessor, he said, and little by little he began to appreciate the good that comes when people are allowed to unburden themselves \u2013 the salutary effect of speaking words, of releasing words that tell the story of what happened to them.\"So Sam transitions from non-attachment to engagement with life and, by doing so, he reinvigorates Anna as well.An Escape Never Made?At the end of the novel, Anna\u2019s unlikely \"bande a part\" is poised to escape the city.So Anna writes her letter in the days leading up to their departure.We never know whether they succeeded or what happened to them subsequently.A Collection of Last ThingsWhile there might be a tragedy inherent in this story, it also says something about the role of story-telling and writing.Life is ephemeral. It happens, and once it has happened, it moves into the past and ceases to be:\"These are the last things, she wrote. One by one they disappear and never come back...When you live in the city, you learn to take nothing for granted. Close your eyes for a moment, turn around to look at something else, and the thing that was before you is suddenly gone. Nothing lasts, you see, not even the thoughts inside you. And you mustn\u2019t waste your time looking for them. Once a thing is gone, that is the end of it.\"If thoughts can\u2019t survive, then neither can memories.Memories require a human to maintain and transmit them.Absent people, the memories die, and the reality that once was is no more.Just as people deny the Holocaust, once the memories cease, people start to forget or deny the underlying factuality.A Recollection of Lasting ThingsStill, Anna feels the compulsion to write, to preserve these memories, to create an amulet:\"I am not sure why I am writing to you now...But suddenly, after all this time, I feel there is something to say, and if I don\u2019t quickly write it down, my head will burst. It doesn\u2019t matter if you read it. It doesn\u2019t even matter if I send it \u2013 assuming that could be done. Perhaps it comes down to this. I am writing to you because you know nothing. Because you are far away from me and know nothing.\"Towards the end, Anna pictures her letter as \u201cone last thing to remember me by\u201d.The notebook could end up as a thing sitting on a shelf above a bed, one last thing that might last.Boris the ChameleonAnna owes some of this change of approach to the flamboyant, charlatan-like Boris Stepanovich.At first, she is captivated by, but sceptical about, his tale-telling and his constant metamorphosis:\"One by one, he took on the roles of clown and scoundrel and philosopher.\"Unlike anyone else she has met, his character shifts:\"A man must live from moment to moment, and who cares what you were last month if you know who you are today?\"Yet Boris is a sentimentalist at heart, if a wily one.Without words and memories, who would know what they are today anyway?He says of a precious tea cup:\"The set has suffered the fate of the years\u2026and yet, for all of that, a single remnant has survived, a final link to the past. Treat it gently, my friend. You are holding my memories in your hand.\"Hats Off to BorisAnna gets another clue from Boris' love of ornate hats:\u201dBoris explained that he liked to wear hats because they kept his thoughts from flying out of his head. If we both wore them while we drank our tea, then we were bound to have more intelligent and stimulating conversations.\u201dEqually, perhaps, society needs memories, to be truly civilized.Civilisation is what separates us from mere subsistence, whether in a ghetto or a garret.So, ultimately, Boris too revitalises Anna:\"We became dear friends, and I owe Boris a debt for his compassion, for the devious and persistent attack he launched on the strongholds of my sadness.\"Likewise, Boris becomes the inspiration for the escape plan:\"Make plans. Consider the possibilities. Act.\"Humanity must not just embrace contemplation, it must embrace action to survive.Promise to WriteAnna promises to write to her friend when they get out of the city of destruction.We never find out whether she got out safely, or survived, or posted her letter, or ever wrote again.Hear Me Calling YouStill, we are lucky to have read her epistle of engagement and action and persistence and humanity.She did not just call out into the blankness, or scream into a vast and terrible void.She did not just create one of the last things that will disappear, she created something that will last.She did not write in vain.The \"you\" she was writing to has become the \"we\" who have read Paul Auster's novel.It is we who have heard her call."], ["\u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627

You read Auster!\" I have other friends who, when entering my library for the first time, see my collection of Auster novels and say, \"Oh my God! You read Auster!?\" One way spoken in surprise and delight, the other in surprise and derision. Yes, Auster polarizes.And I get why people don't like him. Many of his novels have a self-referential shtick that I can see as being off-putting to some readers. I once had dinner with a friend in L.A., a card carrying Austerhater, and I was trying to convince him of the merits of Leviathan. I kept coming at him in different ways, trying to sell my way around his objections, but no sale. At one point he actually said, \"If you don't stop talking about that shit book I won't tell you about an amazing book I've just finished that I was going to recommend to you.\" This friend, despite his Auster issues, has really good recommendations (this is years before GR, mind you, his influence is waning thanks to my new chums) - I took the bait, dropped the Auster pitch and received the recommendation for The Fortress of Solitude. I was never going to convince this friend of Auster's merits, so I consider it a good trade. But after having completed this beautiful and haunting novel, I will go to the mat for Auster on this one. A fully imagined vision of hell, ItCoLT is a meticulously and beautifully written book of a dystopian country that is only a few shades of horrible away from life on any of Earth's locales. Auster's use of the first person narrator (penning her thoughts to a family she may never see again) leading the reader through a tale of horror in a nameless country works. We are invested in Anna Blume from the opening pages. Good and evil, right and wrong - they are worthless considerations in a land where humanity is an anachronism. Huxley opined, \"Maybe this planet is another planet's hell.\" Auster takes that premise to the next place, our hell, and creates a setting that is so clear, so horrible, one can't help but feel like one's been there after reading Anna Blume's missive.I'm going to buy another copy of this book and give it to my Auster hating friend for his birthday. If he doesn't like it, I will revoke his literary friend status."], ["The account in the form of a letter of a girl who has gone to look for her missing brother in a dystopian city where everything that provides a sense of self is vanishing. There\u2019s a constant sense of an author discovering and enjoying his talent in this short novel. He doesn\u2019t waste energy on making his world logically plausible or itemising how the apocalyptic disaster happened. We\u2019re very much in an existential twilight zone world. The tone essentially is one of macabre playfulness. There\u2019s lots of black humour as for example in the many cults (often of a suicidal nature) that have formed to deal with the growing hopelessness of the situation. My favourite were \u201cThe Runners\u201d. The runners run as fast as they can, waving their arms about wildly until they simply drop dead. Like jogging taken to a whole new level in other words. There\u2019s lots of parody of our contemporary world \u2013 every scavenger has a supermarket trolley, his or her most precious possession, tied to her waist like an umbilical cord. \"That is what the city does to you. It turns your thoughts inside out. It makes you want to live, and at the same time it tries to take your life away from you.\"But along with the humour there\u2019s also a chilling evocation of the Nazi ghettos and concentration camps.

Close your eyes for a moment, turn around to look at something else, and the thing that was before you is suddenly gone. Nothing lasts, you see, not even the thoughts inside you.Paul Auster's last novel, Sunset Park, opens with the main protagonist working for a south Florida realty company which deals with cleaning out reposessed homes; his name is Miles Heller, he's 28 and he takes photographs of abandoned things, the innumerable things the previous homeowners left behind when they were evicted. Set in the recession of 2008 and taking place in Florida and New York, the novel features a cast of characters whose stories intervine as they strive to survive after the economic collapse. In The Country of Last Things is an earlier work, and one where the conditions are much more dire. Although the time period and the location are never specified, we can guess that the storyline is set in roughly contemporary times after something went wrong, and caused an unnamed City (which is most likely modeled after New York) to become a separate country, the Country of Last Things. The last things are the all things which keep disappearing one by one: whole streets and buildings implode or are destroyed, taking their inhabitants and their posessions with them. Babies are not born anymore, and human bodies and waste have become precious commodities which the officials use for generating energy; burial is treated as a serious crime. Although a government is in power it is never stable and does not hold power over the city, which is ruled by the underworld; on the streets the strong rule over the weak. Scavenging is common, but one must buy the license from a license from the underworld to become a legitimate scavenger, and not get assaulted by the \"inspectors\". People with shopping carts populate the streets, hunting for what is still there. A large percent of the population is homeless, but most homes are no better than the streets: stripped from furniture, without heating. Leaving the city seems to be impossible,with travel permits being ridiculously expensive and government officials hunting down those who want to exit illegally.Into this world comes Anna Blume, a woman looking for her brother, William. William has been sent to write a book on the city - but contact with him has vanished, and the man whom William's editors sent to find him has also disappeared. Desperate, Anna enters the city and as she tries to survive in a world where nothing is produced and everything is running out she realizes the hopelesness of her quests. Yet, Anna refuses to give up, and continues her search. The novel is a first person account written by her as a letter to an unspecified acquaintance, a friend from time before. She doesn't even know if the letter will ever be read, but she continues, refusing to give up and vanish, become yet another Last Thing.All of Paul Auster's fiction deals with the struggle of the Self against the absurd world ruled by chance and accident, the overwhelming effect the compilation of events has on the individual, the intensity with which his protagonists are affected by what they cannot control. These themes are prominent in in The Country of Last Things as well, which is arguably his darkest novel: set in a world literally ending, where individuality is almost completely eliminated and people are reduced to what they can scavenge. Throughout her journey through the City with its ever changing landscape, Anna will meet several quirky characters, each of which will serve a purpose in her journey and affect her in some way. Although some of Anna's observations about life border on banal, It's hard to not sympathize with her and root for her cause, however hopeless it may be.Paul Auster is a talented talespinner and his polished prose is elegant and flows smoothly. Although short in lenght, the novel is finely crafted and features a convincingly drawn post-apocalyptic environment, detailed enough to prevent the novel from sinking into the bog of run of the mill post-apocalyptic fiction. Like other dystopian works it can also be read as an allegory of contemporary world of here and now: opressive governments, shortage of money and food, eviction, suicide. Although it deals with these bleak themes, I felt that the ultimate message is the one of hope - even if it seems unreasonable and pointless; Anna's journal is a success of creation in a world of destruction. By reading the novel we feel that she has succeeded and her efforts were not in vain - her journal has been found and read, and will continue to be read. We pass it on, and it continues to exist, sendings its message and her in it ever onwards, never becoming a Last Thing, helping to keep Anna in our memory and thought and preventing her from disappearing into oblivion.This is the first novel I've read in 2013.

Prvo me je odu\u0161evio \"Put\" Kormaka Makartija, a zatim \"The Pesthouse\" D\u017eima Krejsa. Nisam sumnjao u Pola Ostera. On me je svojevremeno \"kupio\" \"Njujor\u0161kom trilogijom\", tako da sam sigurnim korakom u\u0161etao u njegovu postapokalipsu, i iz nje iza\u0161ao apsolutno zadovoljan ali i poprili\u010dno uznemiren...Dok \u010ditaju ovaj Osteov roman, \u010ditaoci u stvari \u010ditaju pismo glavnog lika, Ane Blum (da li je to mo\u017eda antiteza D\u017eojsovog Bluma), upu\u0107eno starom prijatelju iz detinjstva. Ona mu obja\u0161njava kako i za\u0161to je iz kakve-takve sigurnosti oti\u0161la na ve\u0107 nesigurno tlo da bi prona\u0161la brata. Na bratovljevoj adresi vi\u0161e ne postoji ni zgrada, a ona u rukama \u010duva blago - sliku poslednje osobe koja je znala ne\u0161to o njemu, i ona kre\u0107e u potragu za bilo kojim od njih dvojice. Ana se upu\u0161ta u to, \u017ertvuju\u0107i sebe i usput u\u010de\u0107i nove lekcije uvek na onaj te\u017ei na\u010din. Dok u svom pismu bude opisivala svoju borbu za opstanak, zaljubljivanje, borbu za goli \u017eivot, gubitak voljene osobe,... opisiva\u0107e i svakodnevnu rutinu, ruine nekada\u0161njeg sveta, otpad koji ima ogromnu vrednost, \u017eivot koji ima minimalnu vrednost, ali i nove klanove: trka\u010de, skaka\u010de, grabljivice,... koji su slika novog \u010dove\u010danstva.Oster nam u ovom romanu ne daje direktan opis apokalipse. Njegov naglasak je na onome \u0161ta je usledilo, ali pre svega na ljudima. On opisuje zemlju nakon kolapsa, propast, ruine, pra\u0161inu, pepeo, ali njega najvi\u0161e interesuju ljudske ruine. Kao i Makarti, poku\u0161ava da doku\u010di da li u op\u0161tem ludilu klica ljudskosti (humanizma) mo\u017ee da se razvije u ne\u0161to dobro i lepo, ili \u0107e ona biti zatomljena i uni\u0161tena. Dakle, ono \u0161to je najbolje u ovom romanu jesu Osterovi likovi. Po\u0161to je roman poprili\u010dno kratak, on nije dozvolio svim likovima da se podjednako razviju. Najdominantniji su glavni lik, Ana, i Boris Stepanovi\u010d (jedan od onih likova koji plivaju i u mutnim vodama).

They do the same thing with us by rewriting our history. They do not have to be right, they only have to do the act itself.-Scott Kayla Morrison (\"Kela Humma\" (Red Hawk)), Choctaw, 'An Apokni by Any Other Name Is Still a Kakoo'\nIf you've been following #NoDAPL at all, you'll know that a recent presidential decision has effectively halted construction of a oil pipeline too toxic for white suburban communities but, apparently, just right for indigenous reservations. This victory seems, perhaps, in the wake of 2016's unique nightmare before the holidays less than it could have been, but it still marks a triumph in the midst of the horror that is 500+ years of rape in terms both archaic and otherwise. Seizure of another's property. Land grab. Woman grab. Children grab. Cultural eradication. Kill the indigenous, save the man. Treaties put into place two centuries and more in place that, despite having been violated less than a week letter, still control the language with which the original inhabitants of what is currently known as the Americas use to refer themselves. Should they refuse this language, they come under the threat of being stripped of what little they have left. What, then is there left to be done?\nI feel that writing is an act of survival. But there is more than my own survival that is at stake. These days I feel a kind of urgency to reconstruct memory, annihilate the slow amnesia of the dominant culture, and reclaim the past as a viable, if painful entity.-Janice Gould, Maidu\nJoy Harjo. Janet Campbell Hale. Paula Gunn Allen. Velma Wallis. Leslie Marmon Silko. Elizabeth Cook-Lynn. Linda Hogan. Beth Brant. Wilma Mankiller. Louise Erdrich.

Scott Kayla Morrison aka Kela Humma, Choctaw. Susan Power, Yanktonnai Sioux. Janice Gould, Maidu. Jeannette Armstrong, Okanagan. These are reinventers of the enemy's language that I found 'striking' and, perhaps mistakenly, believe other enemies have not yet come into with. There are many others, and because I pushed too hard when it came to which women owned their names in artistry and which ones didn't, I can neither create nor ameliorate their author profiles on this particular website. That is probably for the best, though. I already conduct too much free labor for this corporatized library as is.More than half of the states composing the US owe their linguistic sustainability to the indigenous people, metaphorical roots which do little to combat sequestering in reservations and genocide everywhere else. It's not the only reason why I still get friend requests from people with whom a share nearly 300 works, of which a mere three are by women of color, but the situations run on the same fuel. Within the already sunken realm of writings by women of color there is still yet further stratification, and I will admit to having fallen into their trap while devoting two thirds of 2016's reading to this oft neglected but still hierarchical demographic. Good intentions will always pave the road in hell if they are ever considered anything more than a work in progress.\nI didn't feel rebellious. I felt honest.In the other world of the preparatory school I attended, experience felt abstract, refracted through the distancing process of intellectual analysis.-Susan Power, Yanktonnai Sioux\nThe half star I took off of this is for arbitrary reasons such as personal aesthetics when it comes to compilations such as these, as well as the fact that I couldn't follow my transient reading footprint with a more stable digital directory one. As such, I leave the shinier one up top unmarked, as there is a vast difference between positive ratings for the sake of socioecononmic prosperity and boosting works in order to actively resist annihilation. Nowadays, it is possible for works such as Weweni and Sanaaq to exist, so perhaps the Overton window can be pushed past the need to reinvent the enemy and into the right to exist on less lethally linguistic terms. However, that won't happen on its own, or in a vacuum, or without effort which should rightfully rest on the shoulders of those who rendered the language lethal in the first place, not those doing their best to survive it. #NoDAPL continues on despite assurances of victory, for that is only one branch of the beast sunk into the heart of myriad peoples, and such monstrosities always sleep with one of many eyes open.\nI watched rockshurled and smashedinto cars of old Mohawk menwomen and childrenon a bridgein Montrealand the million-dollarrock slideblockageson ten BC roadsafter stones rained down rock cliffson police liftinghuman blockadesprotecting the slow disintegrationof bones into sandresting under headstoneson Liliwat land-Jeanette Armstrong, Okanagan, 'I Study Rocks'"], ["I can't put into words how great this is.

But seeing a bit of silent film comedy on TV, he takes up the task of examining and writing a book about the work of one comedic genius from the 20\u2019s. Soon after the book is published the wife of the supposedly dead film-maker contacts Zimmer to ask if he might like to meet the man himself. There is much parallelism here, Zimmer with both Hector Mann, the ancient film-maker and Chateaubriand, the author of a lengthy autobiography that Zimmer is translating. In a way all three are dead. Zimmer and Mann had both attempted suicide. And a character in the book ultimately succeeds in such an attempt.What is real and what is illusion? Hector had been in the business of illusion, then had to present an illusion of himself for most of his life. His film The Life of Martin Frost echoes the book\u2019s theme of illusion. Sometimes an illusion can be a helpful thing, as when Zimmer is comforted by Alma on the plane (see below).There is a passage in which Mann spots what he believes to be a blue stone on the street. He has a detailed plan of what he will do with it, alive with human connection, only to find that it is a gob of spit. Yet the imagining was enough to alter his life course. Maybe illusions are what we tell ourselves, what we need, in order to survive. I enjoyed the book very much. It was a fast read, engaging, with interesting characters and enough suspense to sustain a level of tension. There was, perhaps, too little told of Hector\u2019s wife and why she does what she does. Well, Auster does explain, but I found it unconvincing. I wish that I had kept better track of characters. No, there are not hordes of them. I just wish that I had tracked the braiding of the stories. There is much interweaving here, much that occurs for some that also occur for others. I was too tired while reading this to devote adequate attention to that. C\u2019est la vie.

As with the other Auster I've read (I know I've only read 2 Austers, I am such a failure at being pretentious), I finished this and I was like... what, why did I read this?To explain myself I should say that I follow the Roger Ebert school of criticism. Roger Ebert cares more about how a movie makes him feel than on its technical merits. Granted, this is rather less valid in the medium of words on a page than the sound and fury of film, but I still stick to it. I have no problem trashing Plath's Bell-jar, regardless of its supposed literary merit or historical significance, because it bored and annoyed me.But getting to the point of this book, let me break it down for you literary thugs: there is a man whose family dies in an accident. He is depressed, but then he sees a silent comedy on TV and laughs for the first time in long while. He then decides to write about the star of this silent comedy, a man named Hector Mann. In the course of this, he finds out that Hector Mann disappeared, but he may actually still be alive!!! Stuff ensues, there are some themes brought up, there's some angst, there's some sex, you know the drill. And don't worry none of that's spoiler material, all on the first page basically.Worth reading for a few pieces of stellar writing. I was particularly impressed by how Auster writes about a film that doesn't actually exist. I bought into it, I was convinced. It's a story within a story (within a story within a story ad nauseam), and it's true that the inner stories are better told than the outer ones. I'm cool with that.In summary, though: \"Paul Auster, you bastard!\" is my review. If you likewise enjoy calling famous authors bastards, then I recommend this book to you highly.As a side note, a result of this novel, I had to add a new shelf called \"bepretentious.\" Just read some of the other, actually useful reviews and you'll see what I mean."], ["By reading this book I have become a die-hard Auster fan. The man is amazing. So clever, so imaginitive, so poetic and almost profound. This book rambles, and in doing so touches on so many intertwined narratives that one almost gives up on what was assumed to be the original plot and assumes the opening catch phrase was just another Paul Auster smoke screen story line. But this one, even in creating such an intricatedly woven network of a character experiences, never looses sight of its ultimate goal - to explain how the supposed disapearance of a silent film actor affected the life of a professor and widower from Detroit. The world created in this book is done with such care and is so full of unexpected and tangential details that I found myself wondering if I wasn't perhaps reading a work of historical fiction rather than just a plain old novel. It's an amazingly well crafted narrative, heartwrenching and hopeful at the same time. A man's life is an illusion to all except those who share in it."], ["Paul Auster obviously has a thing for men who linger between reality and nothingness. Men whose realities take a turn towards the vague, so much so, that they seem to dress themselves in the vagueness that surrounds them. Men who lose everything or men who never really had anything to begin with. Men who seem to be caught for good inside an illusion along with everyone that surrounds them. Now they\u2019re here, now they\u2019re not. There are two of those men in The Book of Illusions: the narrator and Hector Man. Bound to each other, they meet only for an hour toward the end but the echo of their meeting is present after as much as before the event.What strange time for me to read this particular book!

I regret, however, that my own illusions take up much of my mental capacity nowadays, which proved unable to fully embrace this haunting novel. Not that I regret the illusions themselves. Where would the point in that be, after all?It\u2019s haunting, intense, and filled with a melancholy that sticks on your fingers with every page that you turn. There\u2019s a kind of sadness in the very idea of illusions, and Auster sure took great advantage of that. It\u2019s the idea that everything you have can disappear in the blink eye. Something precious falls into our arms and we call it a miracle. One day, we open our eyes and it\u2019s gone. Then, it\u2019s a tragedy. The worst is that, once it\u2019s gone, one can never be sure if it was ever even there.Don\u2019t be fooled, The Book of Illusions is so much more than my clouded mind can produce right now.

This famous question is closely examined in \"The Book of Illusions,\" by author Paul Auster, as he tells the story of literature professor David Zimmer, who copes with the death of his wife and two sons by shutting out the real world so that he can inhabit the \"silent world of Hector Mann,\" an obscure actor from the 1920s. After leaving a dozen movies behind that nobody seems to know about, Hector disappeared in 1929, presumed dead. However, it turns out he is actually alive in New Mexico, paying penance for the role he played in the accidental death of his girlfriend \u2013 vowing never to make another movie and eventually only agreeing to make movies if they will be destroyed immediately upon his death and never be seen by an audience. According to Hector\u2019s rationale, if he makes a movie and nobody sees it, then his movie does not exist. But is this true? Does an idea have to be shared \u2013 and experienced by others \u2013 to exist and take on meaning? Although he provides confusing answers throughout the work, first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others.At first, Auster suggests Hector can attain greatness on his own, even without an audience. When Hector Mann disappears, his film career is pretty much over due to the invention of sound in movies and his heavy accent. His last major film, \"Mr. Nobody,\" is a response to the frustration he feels about his career, as, in the film, his character takes a magic potion that makes him invisible. Eventually, he is reborn as a new person, and, facing himself in the mirror, he confronts the fact of his own annihilation with an exuberant smile \u2013 the last image of Hector Mann that will be seen by audiences, seemingly content with the idea he is \"no longer the Hector Mann who has amused us and entertained us.\" Similarly, in his own life, Hector is forced to disappear after his girlfriend is killed, and, to disguise himself, he loses his trademark mustache, so that he is \"the spitting image of Mr. Nothing himself.\" In his new life, Hector no longer makes movies, but instead works odd jobs and focuses on reading, writing, learning English, and planting trees. In his journals, Hector writes, \"I talk only to the dead now. They are the only ones I trust, the only ones who understand me.\" Hector no longer shares himself with an audience \u2013 Hector Mann has been annihilated \u2013 but, according to his biographer and friend Alma, he is closer to greatness than ever before: \"[T]he further he traveled from his point of origin, she said, the closer he came to achieving greatness. [. . . ]Even now, he still talks about the trees as his greatest accomplishment. Better than his films, she says, better than anything else he\u2019s ever done.\" In this reading of Hector\u2019s life, based on the interpretation of \"Mr. Nobody,\" Hector is the only voice that matters; even without an audience, he can still attain greatness.However, a later film, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost,\" questions this notion that artists can attain greatness without sharing their work with others. In this movie, which Hector made after his disappearance with the promise it would never be released to an audience, is different from his earlier work: it is serious, not a comedy, and Hector does not act in it. In the movie, Martin Frost, a writer, must destroy his work to save the life of his girlfriend Claire. After she is brought back to life and realizes what has happened, she erupts in tears, asking Martin if he realizes what\u2019s he done and desperately wondering what they are going to do now. The movie ends ambiguously with her questions and no answers from Martin. Similarly, after Hector\u2019s death, his wife Frieda destroys everything \u2013 his movies, his journals, and even the manuscript of a biography his friend Alma had been working on for seven years \u2013 in a \"precise reenactment of the final scene of Martin Frost.\" Pondering Frieda\u2019s actions, David thinks about Hector\u2019s sacrifice of \"the one thing that would have given his work meaning \u2013 the pleasure of sharing it with others,\" but then realizes that, in Frieda\u2019s mind, \"It was about making something in order to destroy it. That was the work, and until all evidence of the work had been destroyed, the work would not exist. It would come into being only at the moment of its annihilation.\" In Frieda\u2019s interpretation, work was not created for others; in fact, sharing Hector\u2019s work with others would cause it to lose its meaning. However, ultimately, both of Auster\u2019s protagonists \u2013 David Zimmer and Hector Mann \u2013 seem to repudiate Frieda and believe that Hector\u2019s work does not lose meaning if it is shared with others. When Alma had first told David about her biography of Hector, he was initially skeptical: \"It\u2019s one thing to unburden himself to you, but a book is for the world, and as soon as he tells his story to the world, his life becomes meaningless.\" In other words, a book exists not for the author or subject but for readers, and by sharing himself with them, Hector could lose himself. He would exist as they saw him, and not as he really was \u2013 their illusions of him would become reality. When David questions Hector about why he would want to give himself away like that, Hector answers, \"Why should it bother me to turn myself into an example for others? [. . . .] You laughed, Zimmer. Perhaps others will begin to laugh with you.\" These words \u2013 the last Hector speaks in the book \u2013 show his realization of the positive impact his work can have on others, as he comes to the conclusion that his earlier films, if they made David laugh, were \"perhaps the greatest good\" he had done. David ultimately seems to embrace Hector\u2019s viewpoint, hoping that others will laugh with him, as he takes pleasure when Hector\u2019s silent comedies are put out on video and becomes an honorary member of a fan club, the International Brotherhood of Hector Manniacs. Most of all, he hopes that someday the lost films of Hector Mann \u2013 the ones that Frieda destroyed \u2013 will be found somehow so others can enjoy them like he did, \"and the story will start all over again. I live with that hope.\" In order to have meaning, Hector\u2019s films must be shared with others. Unlike Frieda, David believes that Hector\u2019s films should be shared with the world. Although he provides confusing answers throughout \"The Book of Illusions,\" first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others. Like the confusing answers to the question of the movie that nobody sees, \"The Book of Illusions\" is full of other confusing themes and contradictions. For example, one major theme of the book is the effect of chance and how small circumstances can have a significant impact on our lives. However, while there are some small circumstances which impact the action in the book, for the most part, the major events are more like contrived and implausible plot devices \u2013 an ex-girlfriend killed by a current girlfriend, a wife and two sons lost in a plane crash, David held at gunpoint so that he will watch a movie, a tough fall resulting in another death, a suicide, a possible murder. Are these really \"small circumstances\" of chance? Moreover, while this issue of fate is explored in depth like the meaning of one\u2019s work, the two themes are never tied together. In Auster\u2019s telling, both Hector and David cope with loss by turning to art but they are not reborn again except through accidents of fate, so that the one seemingly resolved idea in the book \u2013 the issue of the movie nobody hears \u2013 becomes irrelevant compared to the greater themes of fate and rebirth. The interplay between the various themes is never explored, and it is easy to get confused as all of these ideas are presented, but are often contradicted and never fully resolved, leading a reader to ponder the 2001 Atlantic Monthly article\u2019s criticism of Paul Auster: \"[He] knows the prime rule of pseudo-intellectual writing: the harder it is to be pinned down on any idea, the easier it is to conceal that one has no ideas at all.\" In light of the questions asked in \"The Book of Illusions,\" it is easy to wonder: if an author throws out a lot of different ideas but never resolves them, so that readers can\u2019t understand what those ideas are, do the ideas actually exist?"], ["David Zimmer is a teacher and writer whose wife and two young sons have been killed in an aeroplane crash. At his lowest ebb, suicidal and alcoholic, David sees a silent film on television and laughs for the first time since the tragedy. Thereafter, he develops a fascination with the actor featured in the old movie, Hector Mann - a minor star of silent comedies who vanished in 1929 and was never seen or heard of again. Travelling around the world in order to visit the film archives containing Hector's few movies, David channels his obsession into a book about the actor's work. However, the story really begins some time after this, when David receives a mysterious letter containing some startling news about Hector.The Book of Illusions displays many characteristics of Auster's typical style, most noticeably the constant presence of symbolism, the perceived significance of art and the line between reality and (as the title suggests) illusion. Here, rather than the emphasis being on language and writing, the focus is on Hector's films and their visual impact, though of course the power of storytelling is still key. When David discovers that Hector made some films that were never seen by anyone else, he questions whether art has any importance if it is not shared with and experienced by an audience. David's ruminations are mirrored in various ways throughout the narrative - David withdraws from life, shuts himself away and becomes invisible, so it seems ironic that he becomes obsessed with a silent movie star; Hector makes a film called 'Mr. Nobody' in which he literally becomes invisible, and then, in his real life, he disappears; another character, Alma, is made more visible by a large birthmark on her face, yet she feels this gives her the ability to instantly see others' true characters through their reactions to her appearance.There are elements of the story that are, from a distance, completely implausible. The manner of David and Alma's first meeting is really quite ridiculous, and certainly unbelievable, as is the speedy development of their relationship. But I think this is where the genius of Auster's writing really lies, in suspending the reader's disbelief and immersing you so deeply into the story that these strange events seem believable. I can imagine that the book won't work for everyone - some may find the lengthy descriptions of unseen, nonexistent films dull (I really enjoyed them), and there's a curious... quietness about it all - a very subdued feel. This is not a deeply thrilling novel, more of a restrained but haunting little tale.

Reading Paul Auster</i> the first book-length study solely devoted to the novels of Paul Auster. From the vantage-point of poststructuralist theory, especially Lacanian psychoanalysis and Derridean deconstruction, this book explores the relation of Auster's novels <i>City of Glass, In the Country of Last Things, Moon Palace, </i> and <i>The Music of Chance</i> to the rewriting and deconstruction of genre conventions; their connections to concepts such as catastrophe theory, the sublime, Freud's notion of the 'death drive;' as well as the philosophical underpinnings of his work. At the focus of this study, however, is the concept of desire, an important concept in the writings of both Auster and Lacan, and the various manifestations of this concept in Auster's novels. Auster's novels always emphasize a kind of outside of the text (chance, the real, the unsayable), a kind of hope for a 'transparent language, ' a hope, however, that is exactly posited as impossible to fulfill. The relation of Daniel Quinn, Anna Blume, Marco Fogg and Jim Nashe to this lack is the motor of their desire, the driving force for the subject that has <i>always already</i> left the real and has been inscribed into the representational system called 'reality.' It is here, in its relation to the signifier, that the subject's desire is played out, that its experience is ordered, interpreted, and articulated. It is their ability to make connections, to proliferate, to 'affirm free-play, ' their ability 'not to bemoan the absence of the centre' that ultimately decides over success or failure of Auster's subjects - whether they partake in the 'joyous errance of the sign, ' or whether their fate is that of the 'unfortunate traveler.'", "author": "Bernd Herzogenrath"}, "Cosmopolis": {"average_rating": "3.22", "review": [["Pre-Film ReviewI re-read this novel, before seeing David Cronenberg\u2019s film (see Post 21).SPOILERSThis review reveals what I think about the fate of the protagonist at the end of the novel.My views are based on my interpretation of material that starts at page 55 of the 209 page novel.If this material or my interpretation is incorrect, then the novel leaves you hanging at the end.As my views on the novel as a whole depend on an interpretation of the protagonist\u2019s fate, please don\u2019t read my review if you want to form your own views in isolation.Mutual DedicationIn 1992, Paul Auster dediciated \u201cLeviathan\u201d to Don DeLillo.In 2003, DeLillo repaid the favour by dedicating \u201cCosmopolis\u201d to Auster.Here is a photo of the two of them [on the left] taken at the baseball with two employees of the Gotham Book Mart by the store\u2019s owner:The Name \u201cCosmopolis\u201dWe are all used to the word \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d, but \u201ccosmopolis\u201d is less commonly used.To the extent that the prefix \u201ccosmo\u201d suggests the world or the universe, it implies that the city is representative of the diversity of the world or the universe.We can probably infer that the city is sophisticated and worldly, has an international rather than provincial character, and is home to many cosmopolitan people.If so, the term would be a perfect description for New York City, where the novel is set.It also applies to ancient Athens and Rome, perhaps the original \u201cworld-cities\u201d.Manhattan OdysseyThe novel is largely set in a long white limo that drives its protagonist, 28 year old billionaire and hedge-fund manager Eric Packer, across Manhattan.Most plot summaries describe the purpose of the journey as to enable Eric to get a haircut.However, this misses much of the narrative and metaphorical significance of the journey, not to mention the haircut.The journey is more or less the whole of the length of 47th Street, which runs one-way between 1st Ave and the West Side Highway (called the Joe DiMaggio Highway since just before the publication of the novel).Climbing Down from A Cosmopolitan Triplex in the Heavens...At the 1st Ave end, you\u2019ll find the United Nations Headquarters, perhaps the centre of cosmopolitanism.Eric lives in a triplex close to 1st Ave. The building is not named, but the triplex supposedly cost Eric $104M.At the corner of 47th and 1st is the Trump World Tower, which was completed in 2001.The duplex penthouse in this building failed to sell for $58M, and was eventually split into four units. However, as at 2003, the highest price for an apartment in Manhattan was the $70M paid by hedge-fund manager Martin Zweig for a triplex at the Pierre Hotel owned by Lady Mary Fairfax (of the Australian family that published the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers).Eric\u2019s purchase price represents a 50% increase on the highest price ever paid at the time. You can do that if you're a billionaire.As you drive along 47th Street, you pass the Diamond District, a number of Broadway Theatres and Times Square.Between 1963 and 1968, Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory was on 47th Street between Second and Third Aves....and Descending into Hell\u2019s KitchenOn the West Side, the Street passes into Hell\u2019s Kitchen, also known as Clinton (not named after Bill) or Midtown West (not named after Mae), the original home of Damon Runyon\u2019s stories, Marvel Comics' \"Daredevil\", gang wars between migrants, and the musical \"West Side Story\".The Wiki article on Hell\u2019s Kitchen recounts a number of versions of the origin of the area\u2019s name:\u201c\u2026the most common version traces it to the story of Dutch Fred The Cop, a veteran policeman, who with his rookie partner, was watching a small riot on West 39th Street near 10th Avenue. \"The rookie is supposed to have said, \u2018This place is hell itself,\u2019 to which Fred replied, \u2018Hell's a mild climate. This is Hell's Kitchen.\u2019 \" Gail Wynand, the newspaper proprietor in Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d, came from Hell\u2019s Kitchen and in Rand\u2019s novel is described as \u201cPetronius from Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d, a description that might also apply to Eric Packer (except that he ends there, rather than originates from there).Interestingly, the original Petronius, believed to be the author of \u201cThe Satyricon\u201d, was described as the \u201celegantiae arbiter\u201d (or the \u201carbiter elegantiarum\u201d), \"the judge of elegance\" in the court of the Roman Emperor Nero.West 47th Street has yet to be developed and still contains relatively disused and derelict buildings (including the building that features in the end of \u201cCosmopolis\u201d), not to mention the homeless and mentally ill treated at \u201cFountain House\u201d who featured in the documentary \u201cWest 47th Street\u201d.Mapping Eric\u2019s ProgressI have included all of this detail (thanks, Wiki), so that I can argue that this journey isn\u2019t just some trip to the barber.It represents a journey along a street that defines the extremes of Manhattan, from the cosmopolitan East Side to the Hellish West Side.Just to help you map Eric\u2019s progress, here are the pages at which his limo passes each Avenue crossing 47th:1st: 92nd: 133rd: 23Lexington: 34 (the hair salon Filles et Garcon actually seems to be at 51st)Park: 38Madison: 415th: 45 (The Presidential Cavalcade)6th: 757th/Broadway: 878th: 1299th: 130 (the Sufi rap artist Brutha Fez's Funeral)10th 158 (the barbershop) 11th: 17012th: 179 (the derelict tenement)This is no mere haircut, this is a low-key to subtle homage to James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d, in which our hero leaves the Heaven of his triplex, heads west (young man) and confronts his destiny in a derelict building in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.Perhaps, our hero even meets his anti-hero.Upstairs at Eric\u2019sEric is 28 and has been married to Elise Schifrin for just 22 days.The marriage, so far, is loveless and apparently unconsummated. It represents a symbolic marriage of new American money and traditional European wealth and style, though Elise (\u201cSwiss or something\u201d) is worth a cool $730M herself.Eric has made his money gambling on movements in currencies. He takes immense risks with vast amounts of money and has generated commensurate profits.He is so rich, beyond normal moral or mortal contemplation, some would think it\u2019s indecent and obscene. In the words of his nemesis, Eric is \u201cfoully and berserkly rich\u201d.Yet, until recently, Eric has seen his ability as just an example of what the Greeks call \u201cChrimatistikos\u201d, the art of money-making.He has had talent and drive, which he has \"utilised... consistently put to good use.\" His reward is to live in \"a tower that soars to heaven and goes unpunished by God\", something that aspires to scraping the sky and meeting God, but now in a Godless era seems only to defy the very idea of God and moral virtue or goodness.He contemplates the word \"skyscraper\":\"No recent structure ought to bear this word. It belonged to the olden soul of awe, to the arrowed towers that were a narrative long before he was born.\"Just as skyscrapers have lost their narrative drive, so too have money and the art of money-making:\"...because money has taken a turn. All wealth has become wealth for its own sake. There's no other kind of enormous wealth. Money has lost its narrative quality the way painting did once upon a time. Money is talking to itself.\"Money has turned in on itself, become introverted and meaningless. It no longer tells a story about something else, it does not relate to or measure some other achievement. [The novel echoes some of the concerns of William Gaddis' \"The Recognitions\", but then DeLillo has always mined similar veins.]There\u2019s a point at which you can have so much money that it becomes senseless, there are just no more narratives or stories you can spin with it, without repeating yourself. [I haven\u2019t reached this point yet.]Checking Eric\u2019s BalanceEric\u2019s life so far has been dictated by balance.He lives in a world \u201cin which every force is balanced by another\u201d. When there is another force, he is the equal and opposite reaction.He takes positions and then waits for corrections to occur. The balancing process improves his bank balance.It also dictates his aesthetic judgments.Two private elevators rise to his triplex: in one the music is Satie, in the other Brutha Fez.He gets artistic advice from 47-year old Didi Francher, an art consultant and one of his mistresses.She\u2019s \"taught him how to look, how to feel enchantment damp on his face, the melt of pleasure inside a brushstroke or band of color.\"In a way, she has created a balance to the crudeness and brutality of his occupation.She has taught him how to reckon outside the world of money.He now looks, he notices things, he gazes, he observes, he assesses, he judges.Like Petronius, he has become an \"arbiter elegantiarum\", a \"judge of elegance\".He is obsessed with acquiring a collection of 14 Rothko works housed in the Rothko Chapel:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothko_C...He genuinely appreciates Rothko's art, but his principal motivation for the purchase is the fact that he can afford to.Such is the power of money.Consciously or not, Didi has also taught Eric how to flirt in an intellectually informed way.In his limo, he metaphorically seduces his chief of finance, Jane Melman:\"My mood shifts and bends. But when I'm alive and heightened, I'm super-acute. Do you know what I see when I look at you? I see a woman who wants to live shamelessly in her body. Tell me this is not the truth. You want to follow your body into idleness and fleshiness. That's why you have to run, to escape the drift of your basic nature. ...What do I see? Something lazy, sexy and insatiable.\"They \"[reach] completion more or less together, touching neither each other nor themselves.\"When she leaves the limo, Jane tells Eric that she \u201cis a woman who would still be married to her husbands if they had looked at her the way you have looked at me here today.\"\u201dCatching Eric Off BalanceDespite, possibly because of, this transformation, Didi has noticed doubt creeping into Eric\u2019s worldview.\"You're beginning to think it's more interesting to doubt than to act. It takes more courage to doubt.\"When we meet Eric, he has gambled everything on the possibility that the Japanese Yen will fall.He has also just been told that he has an asymmetrical prostate.Without asking or knowing more about the medical significance of his diagnosis, he assumes the worst, that the cancer will soon take his life.Even if it isn\u2019t fatal, his prostate\u2019s asymmetry challenges his idealization of balance.He suffers pain. The pain undermines the foundations of his worldview. He starts to doubt both balance and himself. He starts to realise there is something in life apart from himself. He starts to recognise his own mortality.Jane addresses him in the third person:\"He could think and speak of other things but only within the pain. He was living in the gland, in the scalding fact of his biology.\"Does he love himself or hate himself. I don\u2019t think he knows. Or it changes minute by minute. Or the question is so implicit in everything he does that he can\u2019t get outside it to answer.\"Eric\u2019s nemesis (who also happens to have an asymmetrical prostate) has worked for him before and has some insight into his personality:\"You should have listened to your prostate...You tried to predict movements in the yen by drawing on patterns from nature...You made this form of analysis horribly and sadistically precise. \"But you forgot something along the way...The importance of the lopsided, the thing that's skewed a little. You were looking for balance, beautiful balance, equal parts, equal sides...\"But you should have been tracking the yen in its tics and quirks. The little quirk. The mis-shape...\"That's where the answer was, in your body, in your prostate.\"Living in the Shadow of a DoubtSo I argue that the purpose of Eric\u2019s journey is to confront his own mortality, to deal with his doubt, not just to get a haircut. Until today, he\u2019s pursued business and wealth as a vehicle for achieving immortality.Vija Kinski, his chief of theory, explains:\"Men think about immortality. Never mind what women think. We're too small and real to matter here\u2026Great men historically expected to live forever even as they supervised construction of their monumental tombs on the far bank of the river, the west bank, where the sun goes down.\"There you sit, of large visions and prideful acts. Why die when you can live on disk? A disk, not a tomb. An idea beyond the body. A mind that's everything you ever were and will be, but never weary or confused or impaired. \"It's a mystery to me, how such a thing might happen. Will it happen someday? Sooner than we think because everything happens sooner than we think. Later today perhaps. Maybe today is the day when everything happens, for better or worse, ka-boom, like that.\"However, having achieved as much as one man could ever achieve in a lifetime, Eric is not interested in trying to create an immortal digital replica of himself.He is interested in his own death, because sooner or later, inevitably, we all have to accept our own mortality:\"He was alert, eager for action, for resolution. Something had to happen soon, a dispelling of doubt and the emergence of some design, the subject's plan of action, visible and distinct.\"Ironically, on the way, Eric embraces the lopsided. When he finally gets his haircut, it is asymmetrical. However, it\u2019s not the end of the journey. He resumes his trip before his haircut is finished. His goal is beyond the haircut. It\u2019s somewhere in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. On the west bank, where the sun goes down.The Threat of DeathEric knows that somewhere on his trip, sometime today, he will die.All along, he has been receiving death threats.His journey across Manhattan is the date of reckoning with his own death, the date when death achieves a balance with life or knocks it off its axis.He equips himself with a gun and abandons his security to deal with his nemesis Benno Levin single-handedly in a dilapidated building in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.By the time he arrives, he\u2019s realised that even business embraces death and destruction:\"This is also the hallmark of capitalist thought. Enforced destruction. Old industries have to be harshly eliminated. New markets have to be forcibly claimed\u2026Old markets have to be re-exploited. Destroy the past, make the future...The urge to destroy is a creative urge\u2026The logical extension of business is murder.\"Death is a natural part of life. He has to endure one last arm wrestle with fate, until he knows that he has died appropriately:\"...it was the threat of death at the brink of night that spoke to him most surely about some principle of fate he'd always known would come clear in time. Now he could begin the business of living.\"He must know and embrace his fate. It does not matter that he might die on the same day. He has already lived life to the fullest:\"This was the day, was it not, for influential men to come to sudden messy ends.\"There is also a sense in which his wealth might come to an end, that his investments will get their own haircut or at the very least, a trim.In his time of dying, the whole of Eric's empire might return, not home, but to nothing.Money might have resumed its narrative drive towards nothingness.Ironically, as the Global Financial Crisis has shown, even billionaires can die with nothing.Frames of Reference\u201cCosmopolis\u201d is short and easy to read. It occupies a discrete time and space.Rather than being DeLillo-lite or a disappointment, it\u2019s a precisely structured novel that lends itself to being filmed.As with much of DeLillo\u2019s work, it\u2019s concerned with ways of looking and seeing and understanding.If anything, I would call it a highly polished example of \"abstracted realism\".It is especially informed by Art and Film.Eric finds in Art a pathway into life\u2019s mysteries, one of them being himself:\"Don't you see yourself in every picture you love? You feel a radiance wash through you. It's something you can't analyze or speak about clearly. What are you doing at that moment? You're looking at a picture on a wall. That's all. But it makes you feel alive in the world. It tells you yes, you're here. And yes, you have a range of being that's deeper and sweeter than you knew.\"To the extent that a painting is one framed work, Film consists of multiple frames.It allows us to explore the situations that we might one day find ourselves in, it creates a frame of reference, it creates frames of reference within which to express ourselves:\"I've seen a hundred situations like this. A man and a gun and a locked door. My mother used to take me to the movies.\"\"Cosmopolis\" is best construed as a gallery of images or a film.It is highly visual and filmic, even though it's effectively set within the confines of a limo.As Eric passes along 47th Street, he witnesses a gallery of events and images and women and must gaze at and judge and react to them, so that ultimately he can determine his own importance in the true scheme of things.My only concern with respect to the film is how the dialogue will come across.How will it convey the abstracted, conceptual precision of DeLillo's language?Will it sound natural?In My State of GraceThe result of Eric's movie-going is that, when he is confronted by the situation (\"a man and a gun and a locked door\", but also his mortality, his death), he knows how to deal with it.This comforts him. In his hour of need.While some of his apparent attempts at self-defence are clumsy, they seem to be designed to fail.Ultimately, what really matters is that he submits gracefully to the inevitability of his own death.It is perhaps the most graceful act of his life. And the last day of his life might equally be the most complete.There is something perfect and satisfying in this grace and completeness, even if it's a little perverse, even if it lacks symmetry, even if (unlike Leopold Bloom) Eric fails to return home to his triplex at the end of the day.P.S. Lapse or Claps, Chaps?While I love this novel, there are passages that I recognise will annoy or vindicate those who question DeLillo's talent or consistency.I choose to excuse them or to laugh instead.Here are a few examples for your reading pleasure:\"Hoisting his genitals in his hand.\"\"The minute you sat there in that whole tragic regalia of running. That whole sad business of Judeo-Christian jogging.\"\"I want to bottle-fuck you slowly with my sunglasses on.\"\"Her feet flew out from under her. She uttered a thing, a sound, herself, her soul in rapid rising inflection.\"\"Eric decided to admire this.\"\"The rain was fine. The rain was dramatically right.\"\"The rain had stopped. This was good. This was clearly what it should have done.\"\"It was the last techno-rave, the end of whatever it was the end of.\"\"He stood in the street. There was nothing to do. He hadn't realized this could happen to him.\"Sceptics, laugh with me.Soundtrack:Jimi Hendrix - Crosstown Traffichttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUwjyr..."], ["I should have known!I read Falling Man and found it impenetrable at first and only slightly less so when I managed to finish it - at the third attempt. Maybe Cosmopolis is very clever; if it is it's way too clever for me. I did stick with it (it's only a short tale) in the hope all would become clear. It never really did. The core theme is simple enough - man with everything really has nothing - but I just could't identify with the main character and, worst of all, the words just didn't knit together for me.I don't know what it is with DeLillo. Maybe I just lack the wit to appreciate his prose, but for me the man just can't string sentences together that provide interest, let alone excitement. And, worse still, I just don't think his writing is cohesive or even understandable much of the time. I'm not going waste my time on him any more.I'm happy to hear alternative views..."], ["Sorry but this was for me below par for DeLillo's standards, which I have to say on the whole are remarkably good. Felt like a second rate Bret Easton Ellis, detached, cold and Narcissistic, infused with a surreal and nightmarish tone. The story is set on the corrosive and packed streets of Manhattan gripped by a state of paranoia and tension, and the comfy confinements of a billionaires stretch limo, this is basically one man's odyssey to get a haircut while the world outside his windows seems to be falling apart. There are clear nods towards 9/11 when written, and although this story is set a year before the terror attacks it quite clearly has a message on the state of American wealth and capitalism. underwhelming feel throughout, but these two reasons didn't help either,1. The last book read by DeLillo was \"The Names\" which had a depth and intelligence far greater than this, and couldn't help but compare the two. 2. Having seen David Cronenberg's film adaptation first, I simply tried in vain to get Robert Pattinson's miserable face out of my head. The saving grace was it's short length."], ["As eerie, weird, morbid, (yet) concise as writers go, Don De Lillo takes the cake. In \"White Noise\", people go a lil crazy after a chemical spill makes an OCD person's otherwise superdirty world into a superdooperdirty world.

Durante questo viaggio, dilatato nelle lunghe ore di percorso, accade di tutto, dalla buffonata alla tragedia.Nel libro di Don DeLillo, molto bello stilisticamente e piuttosto noioso, c'\u00e8 una rappresentazione inquietante ed implicitamente parecchio critica della realt\u00e0 americana contemporanea, con una scrittura di vetro e acciaio, che ben si adatta al paesaggio urbano della metropoli, ed un linguaggio che evidenzia la pochezza umana e la volgarit\u00e0 della realt\u00e0 descritta; linguaggio talvolta in bilico, a rischio di trasformarsi esso stesso portatore di quella volgarit\u00e0. Lo stile dell'autore per\u00f2 regge, anzi diventa un meccanismo letterario collaudato, in cui spesso \u00e8 possibile gustare il piacere estetico emanato dall'architettura del discorso, dal concatenarsi delle frasi : per me lettore, unica piacevolezza che questo libro consenta.Qui DeLillo \u00e8 punta di diamante dello scrittore tipicamente 'americano-americano' contemporaneo volto allo svelamento di personaggi che han perduto se stessi.La pienezza di significato del libro sta proprio nella rappresentazione dello smarrimento di significato, in una societ\u00e0 dove \"la vita \u00e8 troppo contemporanea\" e \"il denaro parla a se stesso\", quando \"l'unica cosa che importa \u00e8 il prezzo che paghi\".Se il potere capitalistico-finanziario giunge ad avere un dominio pervasivo e totalitario, la realt\u00e0 diventa agghiacciante e paralizzata: senza radici, senza una tradizione consolidata a cui attingere, priva di interiorit\u00e0 spirituale ; la ragione, poi, non \u00e8 quella illuminista, bens\u00ec un cascame positivistico fatto di tecnicismo e aridit\u00e0.A questo punto, l'immagine emblematica che resta \u00e8 \"la grande, sparsa bellezza dei bidoni della spazzatura rovesciati\".La saggezza del nostro Alessandro Manzoni ci avvertiva che \"non tutto ci\u00f2 che viene dopo \u00e8 progresso\"."], ["The Problem of Language:\u201cIt was a matter of silences, not words.\u201dThere are those who indict DeLillo on charges of criminal literary laziness, but I would submit that actually, what he possesses is an immense understanding of the limitations inherent in language as a mode of expression, and while perhaps superficially a little ironic, I would also submit that it is a crucial thing on which to have a grasp, as a practitioner of the written word. As evidenced by the overall pithiness, refusal to go into territory that would most likely be discussed at a quantum mystics\u2019 board meeting (do they have board meetings?), and more specifically, the seemingly insignificant (and infantile?) inquiries into linguistics and etymology, he displays his\u2026 (hold on, let me grab my thesaurus)\u2026 perspicacity, not simple-mindedness, in these fields. Our assigned protagonist, Er(obert)ic Packer(son), compulsively dwells on meanings of words. Here he \u201cpokes a note to himself about the anachronistic quality of the word skyscraper\u201d, and here asks his currency analyst, Michael Chin \u201cWhy do we still have airports? Why are they called airports?\u201d, to which Michael esoterically replies, \u201cI know I can\u2019t answer these questions without losing your respect\u201d, which makes sense in that inexplicable kind of way.Perhaps what I am trying to do, if I may provide some context from the past, is defend the Hemingway tradition (not that DeLillo's prose bears much resemblance to Papa's) against the likes of Faulkner, who shunned the former for not requiring his readers to keep a dictionary within arm\u2019s reach, but it\u2019s also something more. I am not merely, or even necessarily, saying that the easiest way to say something is the best way (a literary Occam\u2019s Razor?), but that some things can truly be so personal, harrowing, or bizarre, as to postulate nothing more than that most basic, one-word question, for which even speechless animals know, a head-tilt would suffice. DeLillo knows how to deal with complex issues using sparse, poetic language. Even Libertarians Could\u2026Ayn Rand-ish elements may surface if the wrong pundit gets their hands on this book. If DeLillo were more of a blatant ideologue (I haven\u2019t a clue as to his political outlook), it could be frantically asserted that he had foreseen what was going to happen in \u2018Obama\u2019s America\u2019! People could be holding up copies as tea-bags dangle from their colonial hats. A book could be written entitled Don DeLillo: Prophet of Currency: How Don DeLillo Foresaw the Economic Collapse and the Ensuing Anti-Capitalism Protests of Dangerous and Disorganized Liberal Rats. Maybe in a few years. Poetry Without Inference: Our cosmic wonder is no mystical thing, and with consciousness fleeting it is no wonder to desire that it be \u201csaved from the void\u201d.

Absolutely not something I would normally read. It reminds me of the literary books I had to read for my High school graduation exams. So why torture myself and read it? Well, in May 2011 David Cronenberg will start filming the movie based on this novel that will be released somewhere in 2012. The very talented Robert Pattinson (who I adore) will play the role of Eric Packer, a newly wed financial wizard and billionaire, who drives through town (New York) in his limo to get a haircut. I think the part of Eric, who is pretty (excuse me for the language) f*cked up, will be very challenging for Rob. There are some scenes I'm really looking forward to see on the big screen and some saucy lines I'm really looking forward to hear coming from Rob's mouth.Eric is like this multi-billionaire genius prince who lives isolated in his ivory tower and owns a white horse (limo). He seems to have everything, but yet he has nothing. He's bored, there is no challenge, no satisfaction, he's totally disconnected from the outside world (no friends, doesn't look people in the face/eyes, doesn't know/recognize his own wife), he has a medical condition that frightens him and he doesn't know what to do anymore. He wants to break free, to live, before he dies. He's ready to take the plunge which is pretty courageous for a control-freak like Eric and he wants to do it perfect.During his limo ride through New York, he tries to connect to the world and 'his' women, he removes all obstacles, gets rid of everything until he's stripped and is ready to face... the end. I would be lying if I say that I understand everything that's written in this book, because I don't. It's very poetic, the story has many layers, is confusing, crazy, weird and absolutely no easy read. I always take things too literally and that's why I have problems reading books like this one, but I'm still talking with others about this book and every day I discover new things. I didn't expect it, but I think it's a really interesting story and different from everything else I have ever read. My experience is that the more times you read it the more interesting it becomes.I admit if it wasn't for Rob, I would have never read it, but I'm glad I did. I think you have to see this book (and the movie) as a piece of art, you think about it, you talk about it, you admire it (or not) and never fully understand what's it all about and that's totally fine.

I have not yet read his more famous works, Libra and White Noise, though I'm kind of saving them because in a way, I know it's probably going to be 'down hill' from there. That is to say, Underworld, Libra, and White Noise are probably his best work. So I'm jumping around them. Well, I did read Underworld, but I will probably end up re-reading that one. Everyone seems to either hate Cosmopolis or just appreciate it for its stylistic prose but nothing else. And that seems to be how most people feel about DeLillo. What first drew me to DeLillo was his ability to write a sentence, to say things about the world that I had never dreamed of even thinking about, and then say them in a way that was simple, beautiful, ethereal, and complex. He is a man obsessed with words on a page: how they look, how they sound, the musicality of language. I often feel as if I am reading poetry. His later works, such as The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, and most recently, Falling Man, are becoming more and more abstract. I don't know if it's backlash from Underworld, which was massive and exhausting but in a good way, and now he feels the need to pare his work down to the bare essentials, to compress and compact his novels until he's just writing in between blank spaces. His last three novels combined don't add up to Underworld, page wise.So I gave Cosmopolis four stars. I read it in about two days. I found it oddly compelling. The language is stunning. Just really amazing stuff. And I love the events and situations he puts his characters in. I'm not saying I understood/understand what he's doing all the time, in this post-Underworld space he has made for himself, but I enjoy it all the same, and I find him inspirational, both in how I live in this world, and how I choose to place myself more clearly into this world through words on a page. I will leave you with an excerpt from the end of the book...\"The things that made him could hardly be identified much less converted into data, the things that lived and milled in his body, everywhere, random, riotous, billions of trillions, in the neurons and peptides, the throbbing temple vein, in the veer of his libidinous intellect. So much come and gone, this is who he was, the lost taste of milk from his mother's breast, the stuff he sneezes when he sneezes, this is him, and how a person becomes the reflection he sees in a dusty window when he walks by. He'd come to know himself, untranslatably, through his pain. He felt so tired now. His hard-gotten grip on the world, material things, great things, his memories true and false, the vague malaise of winter twilights, untransferable, the pale nights when his identity flattens for lack of sleep, the small wart he feels on his thigh every time he showers, all him, and how the soap he uses, the smell and feel of the concave bar make him who he is because he names the fragrance, amandine, and the hang of his cock, untransferable, and his strangely achy knee, the click in his knee when he bends it, all him, and so much else that's not convertible to some high sublime, the technology of mind-without-end.\""], ["\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf 3\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Delillo \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5

We follow the one-day disintegration of a 28 year old billionaire asset man, Eric Packer, who decides that morning to take a ride in his stretch limo to the other side of New York, to a place where his father came from, to get a haircut at a place his father used to visit. The ride takes longer than expected, but it brings a conclusion he's content with.This man is on a road to self-destruction and he knows it. He has been insomniac for a while, worried about the shape of his prostate (which turns out to(view spoiler)[ be *nothing* to worry about *lol* (hide spoiler)]), and so he feels this need to go down, Icarus-like, and taking unnecessary risks with money, including that of his wife who he recently married (she takes it(view spoiler)[ rather well; I think she's almost on the same level of indifference as him (hide spoiler)]) and whom he meets several times during the journey.She's not the only one he meets - he also meets people related to his work, security for the limo which (view spoiler)[gradually grows smaller (hide spoiler)], his daily doctor - though this time someone other than regular - plus several lovers. He watches the president - who knows Finnish (this pleases me) - ride in his car live on camera; he sees a glorious funeral of a Sufi rapper (he's a fan, and this is the only time he truly gets emotional); he witnesses a very chaotic, riotous demonstration, including a rather distressing (view spoiler)[self-immolation act of a man (hide spoiler)]. You feel how the action dies down towards the end of journey, as the evening comes and he reaches the destination. And still, even after he reaches the place of haircut, he still has (view spoiler)[to reach the final end: his death through the gun of a man obsessed in finding and killing him. We read this assassin's diary entries here and there among the text - it's pretty obvious that if Packer had not arrived in that part of town, the assassin would have had a lot less chance to kill him. (hide spoiler)]There's themes: doubt and act, life and death, money and criticism against it, balance and off-balance. Packer is quite a weird man; he seems to sort of know beforehand that this is his (view spoiler)[last day (hide spoiler)], he feels free-er, indifferent to things he used to be motivated about, and doing things he would otherwise been unlikely to do: take this ride, (view spoiler)[be reckless with his money dealings, kill the last security guy and just wait for his death, seeing the aftermath already through the patterns in his watch (hide spoiler)].This book feels very much DeLillo's style, and I can say there's some after-echoes of Great Jones Street in here (same city, different time - indifference in the other one too). There's some opinions expressed I found thought-provoking and scenes that were visually beautiful (even when it was destruction or death-related). It's not a book to consider as 'my first book of this author', but if you've read the book mentioned above, or some others - plus perhaps seen the movie - this should do very well.

But the fact remains that Auster is always an enjoyable read--wrangling memories, the self, and being a flaneur, wherever that may be.The book carries an interview piece with Auster and his producer for at least a few pages regarding the adaptation and how he came to write about \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost.\" While I am not a fan of what seems to be a disclaimer or a background piece, as this could have been inserted after the screenplay, the interview rather pre-empts what transpires in the narrative. When Martin Frost wakes up with a stranger one morning, he realizes that what he might be missing in this drive to work on his manuscript seems to stem from his lack of affection. He finds this in the form of a woman, who may or may not exist in the physical world. The days pass by and Martin continues to work diligently, seemingly inspired by this strangers. But as it turns out, it was not only him who is experiencing this phenomenon. Could this be a part of himself that is projected in his life at the moment? Or is Martin living inside his head?

This collection of essays and prefaces on mainly avant-garde-ish writers (I'll ignore the interviews, which are mostly biographical and craft-related) is more informational than astute, and finds his writing sharpened, but dull: the architecture of the sentences and paragraphs is more adroit (with the exception of the titular essay, which reads like a slightly precocious undergrad paper-- it may well be), but the rhetoric is austere and unengaging. Despite having started his career as a poet, Auster displays limited flair for metaphor, simile, and lyricism (these may seem glamour qualms, but sometimes it's the eyeshadow in a writer's voice that catches your eye).

Mi mise dentro una voglia fortissima di continuare a leggerlo, e per questo inseguii a lungo la cosiddetta trilogia di New York (\u2018Citt\u00e0 di vetro\u2019, \u2018Fantasmi\u2019 e \u2018La stanza chiusa\u2019) che all\u2019epoca era fuori catalogo (Rizzoli).Poi, fu finalmente ristampata da Einaudi.Mandy Patinkin nel ruolo di Nashe e James Spader in quello di Pozzi, il giocatore di poker professionista.Credo sia proprio su questi primi titoli che Auster ha costruito da noi il suo culto, la sua schiera di fedelissimi affascinati da quella miscela inquietante di caso e destino che \u00e8 il suo tema di fondo, nonch\u00e9 dalla chiara eleganza dello stile.I film probabilmente hanno incrementato il culto (almeno \u2018Smoke\u2019, \u2018Blue in the Face, \u2018Lulu on the Bridge\u2019).A tutt\u2019oggi, \u00e8 il suo libro che preferisco e, forse, davvero il suo migliore.

Metafisico come sa essere Auster.La partita di poker con i due milionari interpretati da Charles Durning e Joel Grey.La storia vede protagonista Jim Nashe, un vigile del fuoco in crisi economica, motivo per cui la moglie lo lascia. Rimasto solo, eredita dal padre un\u2019inaspettata cifra piuttosto consistente. Si licenzia, acquista una Saab 900 e inizia a viaggiare per gli Stati Uniti, senza meta e senza programmi, un vero vagabondo, come nella migliore tradizione a stelle-e-strisce.

Durante il viaggio, incontra per \u2018caso\u2019 un giocatore professionista, Jack Pozzi, che lo convince a partecipare ad un torneo di poker organizzato da due milionari eccentrici e misantropi, Flower e Stone, nella loro tenuta in Pennsylvania. Sono ricchi e sembrano i classici polli da spennare (hanno vinto ventisette milioni di dollari alla lotteria), vivono completamente appartati e si dedicano a hobby molto particolari: uno fa collezione di oggetti storici e l\u2019altro dedica tutto il suo tempo ad un plastico, la Citt\u00e0 del Mondo.La costruzione del muro sotto gli occhi dell\u2019implacabile sorvegliante e carceriere M. Emmet Walsh.La partita a poker si svolge quindi in questa casa dall'atmosfera cupa e surreale. Ben presto i due milionari si dimostrano meno tonti di quanto Nashe e Pozzi credessero, e la posta in gioco diventa la libert\u00e0 (!). I due giovani perdono la partita e per saldare il loro debito dovranno costruire un muro con le pietre di un vecchio castello irlandese che i due ricconi hanno comprato, fatto smantellare e trasportato.

He held up a receipt he found crumpled up by the bank machine across the street.  \"Hey. Check!\" he said, holding it too close to my face. \"Balance $200,000 tabarnak! My life is fucking garbage and always will be fucking garbage.\"  An unhappy bagger can make for a long afternoon, so I examined the paper, clapped a chapped hand on his shoulder and said, \"Only an idiot would leave $200,000 in a savings account.\"  This seemed to cheer him up a bit, and it gave us a good discussion topic for the rest of the day. When Nashe, in Paul Auster's 'The Music of Chance' plops his $200,000 inheritance into a bank account, I know I'm in for a nervous read about a man will run out of money somewhere awful. Will it be fast? Will it be painful? Even when he's just driving the roads to nowhere in the beginning of the book, there's a lot of suspense over that money in the bank, and later, the glove box; sort of a fiscal musical chairs where I know from the start, Nashe is going to be 'out' in a big way. This is my first Paul Auster book, and I thought it was damn clever the way he wove suspense out of something sitting somewhere and running out. Once the money is gone, he continues to build a good story from other things running out on Nashe; strength, energy, clarity of mind, liberty, companionship, until the end where he finds out what he is made of. And the verdict isn't bad. He's lost everything, but Nashe is made of adequate stuff. He also appreciates how: \"All of a sudden, the stones were turning into a wall, and in spite of the pain it had cost him, he could not help admiring it. Whenever he stopped and looked at it now, he felt awed by what he had done.\" I've never understood gambling, but the stones turning into a wall is a familiar state of mind, and I like how Auster let it sneak up on me, his lovely voice pulling me along. Does he, perhaps, feel this every time he writes a book? And how about this: \"As Nashe and Pozzi discovered, it was one thing to lift a sixty-pound stone, but once that stone had been lifted, it was quite another thing to lift a second sixty-pound stone, and still another thing to take on the third stone after lifting the second. No matter how strong they felt while lifting the first, much of that strength would be gone by the time they came to the second... Every time they worked on the wall, Nashe and Pozzi came up against the same bewitching conundrum: all the stones were identical, and yet each stone was heavier than the one before it.\" This is the best book I have ever read about art, that's not about art. For what are great works of art, especially novels, made of? Heavy-lifting and geologic patience."], ["Another enmeshing, enticing, and enigmatic novel from Paul Auster, and one that features yet again a gent infected with the peregrine spirit, unconcerned about such typically weighty matters as steady employment, pursuing a family life, establishing communal roots, etc. This time the narrator, one Jim Nashe\u2014a man who, upon receiving an unexpected inheritance, opts to abandon his young family in order to aimlessly meander about the young country in the purpose of blowing the entirety of his stack\u2014hooks up with an inveterate gambler, Jack Pozzi, and is persuaded to back him with the remains of his windfall in a poker play against a pair of old duffers whose didactic skills are held to be no match for this Hustler et ami. Alas, fate has played cruelly with these chumps who have dared to test her moods, and Jack and Jim shortly find themselves paying off their sizable gambling loss by means of labouring to build a stone wall across the breadth of the estate of the triumphant, and modestly triumphal, geezers. This is not merely a debt of money, but one of human honour, and there are strict observances and reparations that are expected ere it will be satisfactorily discharged. The loser duo aren't long in discovering the backbreaking requirements of the wall's construction, one that, paired with their room and board expenses, have stretched the debt's termination point unto a despairingly distant horizon. Pozzi chafes under the bonds of indenturement, while Nashe finds himself seeing deep channels carved in this lesson in fiduciary and existential mindfulness. When the tensions mount to the breaking point, not the least observant of readers will be surprised to discover that bad things are going to happen.An absorbing and thoughtful read, if a touch elliptic whenever Auster slips too sartorially into the seamed passions of his postmodern graces. This microcosmic morality play examines the macrocosm that is the capitalist system\u2014one whose constructs have so often been compared to that of a thinly-veiled slavery, and whose memes of debt, with all of the numerical explosiveness of compounded interest and back-burnered principal, chew-up temporally-alloted life in massive, grinding bites\u2014as well as the costs and obligations that are paid-out and amassed in the pursuit of a freedom that can so often prove anything but; not least in the moral morass one can founder within when the question concerns the shirking of one's duties, the breaking of one's word, the strict observance of the law with no recourse to human feeling, pity, or generosity\u2014whether one does indeed spoil the child when the rod has been spared\u2014and how victories won and freedoms gained can pale in the chanced stopwatch measuring of an unmoved world. It was many years ago that I read this, and after I had seen the movie with James Spader and Mandy Patinkin, and I'm not certain that I could honestly state which one I preferred more. It was also my second Auster, \nIn the Country of Last Things\n having been the gateway for me into his own sparse and abstracted and, post \nThe Book of Illusions\n, overplayed and underperforming literary theatre."], ["I think that I had an absolute brainstorm in reading this book.

But then you read the first story, and you start to wonder if this hypothetical scenario of 1980s Pynchon meeting 1950s/60s Pynchon isn't, in fact, too generous: ...if through some as yet undeveloped technology I were to run into him today, how comfortable would I feel about lending him money, or for that matter even stepping down the street to have a beer and talk over old times?Young Pynchon doesn't come off as a dick or even mostly unlikeable, but he doesn't come across as very interesting either. Or, perhaps most surprisingly, as very talented. And here's the silver lining: these stories firmly place the virtuosic talents Pynchon later developed into the realm of possibility for the modestly talented but ambitious would-be writer. Granted, all but one of these stories were written in college, but even so, any previously tempting apotheosis of the man will be permanently erased upon reading these. So that's the good news (I guess). But they aren't much fun to read, and I struggled to remain engaged through each one of them. I'm not going to go into detail about the problems here, mainly because Pynchon does such a damn good job of it in his introduction. It probably goes without saying, however, that any book that peaks with the introduction is in pretty serious trouble."], ["Delinquent JuveniliaIt\u2019s almost inevitable that any author will consider their juvenilia as inferior to their later or more mature works (especially if they made the transition from short stories to fully-fledged and ambitious novels).Thomas Pynchon is no different in his perspective on the five short stories in this collection (which were originally published between 1959 and 1964. Only the last story was published after one of his novels \n(\u201cV.\u201d).\nFrom \u201cUnder the Rose\u201d to \"V.\"It\u2019s generally known that Pynchon was working on all of his first three novels at the same time, but chose to prioritise them differently, both in terms of completion and publication.However, it became apparent from reading the short story \u201cUnder the Rose\u201d (1961) (the fourth in this collection) that there is a creative link between at least this story and the third chapter of \u201cV.\u201d Both works are set in colonial Egypt (Alexandria and Cairo). Both feature the characters Victoria Wren, (the daughter/wife/mistress of) Sir Alastair Wren, Eric/Hugh Bongo-Shaftesbury, Goodfellow, Porpentine and Lepsius. Some of the text is common to both works, although they stand separately. Thus, to criticise the short story is to be equally critical of at least part of the novel. Pynchon himself acknowledges as much when he writes in the Introduction: \n\u201cIf only for its good intentions, I am less annoyed with \u2018Under the Rose\u2019 than with the earlier stuff. I think the characters are a little better, no longer just lying there on the slab but beginning at least to twitch some and blink their eyes open, although their dialogue still suffers from my perennial Bad Ear...Today we expect a complexity of plot and depth of character which are missing from my effort here.\u201d\nPynchon would certainly remedy these deficiencies in \u201cV.\u201d itself, though I think his claim to have a bad ear is unduely harsh, and probably even inaccurate.From \"Weird Crews\" and Gangs to the \"Whole Sick Crew\"Pynchon is most critical of his first story, \u201cThe Small Rain\u201d (1959). It features a company of army men of different levels of responsibility and intelligence. They\u2019re based in Louisiana, when a nearby community is wiped out by a hurricane and they are charged with recovering the bodies of the dead. You could say that this is the beginning of the Pynchonesque collective concept of \u201cthe whole sick crew\u201d, which would later feature in \u201cV.\u201d, as it does in later stories in this collection, like Dennis Flange and his \u201cweird crew\u201d in \u201cLow-Lands\u201d (1960) and Grover Snodd and his \u201cgang\u201d of delinquent boys in \u201cThe Secret Integration\u201d (1964) Integration into the CollectiveThe last of these stories concerns the integration of coloured people into society and school, while the army setting of \u201cThe Small Rain\u201d arguably recognises the importance of the war to greater understanding of other races and creeds (Nathan \u2018Lardass\u2019 Levine, a graduate of CCNY, is described as \u2018the Wandering Jew\u2019).(Mis-)EntropyI had never previously read the story \u201cEntropy\u201d (1960), although I had suspected that its importance to Pynchon\u2019s ouvre might have been exaggerated by academics and critics. The Introduction certainly provides plenty of fodder for this opinion. Pynchon responds to the story with a \u201cbleakness of heart\u201d, describing it as an example of a \u201cprocedural error\u2026to begin with a theme, symbol or other abstract unifying agent, and then try to force characters and events to conform to it.\u201dThe story itself is based on superficial notes Pynchon took from his reading of scientific texts, not some profound pre-existing knowledge (\u201cSince I wrote this story I have kept trying to understand entropy, but my grasp becomes less sure the more I read\u201d). Here is what Pynchon says in the story itself:\n\u201c\u2018Nevertheless,\u2019 continued Callisto, \u2018he [Willard Gibbs] found in entropy or the measure of disorganization for a closed system an adequate metaphor to apply to certain phenomena in his own world. He saw, for example, the younger generation responding to Madison Avenue with the same spleen his own had once reserved for Wall Street: and in American \u2018consumerism\u2019 discovered a similar tendency from the least to the most probable, from differentiation to sameness, from ordered individuality to a kind of chaos. He found himself, in short, restating [Willard] Gibbs\u2019 prediction in social terms, and envisioned a heat-death for his culture in which ideas, like heat-energy would no longer be transferred, since each point in it would ultimately have the same quantity of energy; and intellectual motion would, accordingly, cease.\u201d\nAn Expansion of PossibilitiesThis quotation establishes a context of social science, rather than a wholesale adoption of information or systems theory.It also echoes Pynchon\u2019s comments in the Introduction about the position of his generation between Modernism and what would (or might) succeed it:\n\u201cWe were encouraged from many directions - Kerouac and the Beat writers, the diction of Saul Bellow in \u2018The Adventures of Augie March\u2019, emerging voices like those of Herbert Gold and Philip Roth - to see how at least two very distinct kinds of English could be allowed to coexist. Allowed! It was actually OK to write like this! Who knew? The effect was exciting, liberating, strongly positive. It was not a case of either/or, but an expansion of possibilities. I don\u2019t think we were consciously groping after any synthesis, although perhaps we should have been.\u201cThe success of the \u2018new left\u2019 later in the \u201860\u2019s was to be limited by the failure of college kids and blue-collar workers to get together politically. One reason was the presence of real, invisible class force fields in the way of communication between the two groups.\u201d\n\nOld Left NuancesI\u2019ve argued elsewhere that Pynchon\u2019s support or sympathy for the Old Left surfaces in \n\u201cVineland\u201d\n and \n\u201cBleeding Edge\u201d.\n To focus exclusively and obsessively on Pynchon\u2019s Post-Modernism and paranoia is to place him in a category within which he doesn\u2019t always belong or sit comfortably, and to underestimate the nuances of his political concerns as an individual and an author.It\u2019s interesting in this context that Pynchon describes as \u201cmighty influences\u201d Edmund Wilson\u2019s \n\u201cTo the Finland Station\u201d\n and Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cThe Prince\u201d.It\u2019s also worth highlighting that Pynchon sought \u201can expansion of possibilities\u201d in contrast to John Barth\u2019s \u201cliterature of exhaustion\u201d. The answer was and is to be found in the writer\u2019s individualism rather than their compliance with (by now tired Post-Modernist) proscriptions."], ["Worth it for the introduction alone. This was my 4th Pynchon, and probably a good time for it. Would probably be a bit anticlimactic if I had saved this for last. Highlights: \"Entropy\" and \"Under the Rose\". Also, a Slothrop relative, wart Doctor makes an appearance. Good enough writing, but experience enhanced if you're all-in with Pynchon, natch."], ["Any book that starts out in the preface saying that what you are about to read sucks and then makes a series of apologies about how bad it is and how much he learned and how smart he actually is and on and on with the pretentious 'I really am one of the greatest writers in the 20th century, you just won't be able to tell from the shit you are about to read' litany. That is just self indulgent and embarassing. But, he was right, it all pretty much didn't do a lot except bore. I bought an Elvis Costello re-issue album once that did the same thing. I thought, well, no one ever says anything about this album, I'll give it a shot. Then the first line of the liner notes read: 'Congratulations, you just purchased my worst album ever'I mean really, couldn't you put that on the cover?

Slow Learner : Early Stories by Thomas Pynchon published: 1984 - stories originally published 1959, 1960, 1961 & 1964format: 193 page paperbackacquired: March 13 read: May 30 - Jun 4rating: 4 starsA much nicer reading experience than I expected. The self-deprecating introduction really sets the tone, downplaying expectations and welcoming the reader to just relax a bit and enjoy the flawed stories. These five stories include the first four stories Pynchon published. They were apparently no minor item, as they got noticed and put Pynchon on the map of a small literary crowd before his first book came out. The introduction alone was worth the book. Pynchon is notoriously reclusive, but his introduction is very open. He complains about how amateur these works are and expresses regret over the things he forced into these stories to try to make them more literary. This self-criticism is somehow both a bit in mock and very sincere. It's also spot on, interesting, and charming. The Small Rain 1959A low level army tech takes a minor roll in hurricane response. The hurricane was unexpected, deadly, and actually happened. The response becomes body recovery. This was my favorite story as it works on a simple level - an unusual and casual, almost accidental confrontation with death. It just manages to become more than it is. Low-Lands 1960A man's wife kicks him out of the house. He spends a night in a garbage dump with the overseer. There is a lot of Greek mythology references and a element of horror. Curious.Entropy 1960Actually a kind of cool story that involves a wacky party and the odd young couple one floor below, pondering entropy. But, if I can pretend to give analysis, and this kind of story will encourage you to pretend to do the same, the point seems to be his use of the word entropy in a story context - both giving new meaning to and coloring the entire story. It's one of those interesting ideas I find hard to grasp of all at once. The wild parties become something that cannot hold, if you like. They expend more than what can be replaced. And they become directional, leading toward an end, without ever touching on this directly. Not sure I have it right, or close, but it makes sense to me. It also really defines the sense of everything in V. and Gravity's Rainbow - for him it's a foundational concept. \"The cosmologists had predicted an eventual heat-death for the universe (something like Limbo: form and motion abolished, heat-energy identical at every point in it); the meteorologists, day-to-day, staved it off by contradicting with a reassuring array of varied temperatures.But for three days now, despite the changeful weather, the mercury had stayed at 37 degrees Fahrenheit.\"Under the Rose 1961A take on the tricky world of Fin de si\u00e8cle espionage, where principals seems to play an important, but hard to define roll. This becomes a chapter in V., with some differences. I didn't like it in V. and I didn't like it any better as a standalone. I found it a snobbish effort.The Secret Integration 1964This story actually post-dates V.. The story is, in a nutshell, boys behaving badly. But Pynchon adds and works on a complicated racial element. The boys \"integrate\" themselves with an imaginary black boy, patting themselves on the back for their forwardness, until the town's reality weighs in too heavily. It's both great and not, depending on how you look at it, and there are many different ways. I thought the racial element was forced."], ["Borderline juvenilia. Introduction by author dismisses the collection ab initio as \u201cillustrative of typical problems in entry-level fiction\u201d (4). Explains that \u201cwhen we speak of \u2018seriousness\u2019 in fiction ultimately we are talking about an attitude toward death\u201d (5) which I regard as probably philistine. Nevertheless, author suggests \u201cone of the reasons that fantasy and science fiction appeal so much to younger readers is that, when the space and time have been altered to allow characters to travel easily anywhere through the continuum and thus escape physical dangers and timepiece inevitabilities, mortality is so seldom an issue\u201d (id.), which is definitely philistine. Introduction otherwise has thoughtful comments on entropy, author\u2019s influences, and the nifty comment that his reading allowed \u201cWorld War I in my imagination to assume the shape of that attractive nuisance so dear to adolescent minds, the apocalyptic showdown\u201d (18).Principal text is five short fictions, all generally haunted by the spectre of the Korean civil war (expressly at 44, 61, 172, and implicitly in the others, it seems)First short is a military man down on the bayou. Second involves a dude whose wife kicks him out of the house. Third, \u201cEntropy,\u201d seems to be well-regarded, presents a soiree that host-protagonist wants to stop \u201cfrom deteriorating into total chaos\u201d (97). Fourth is fin de siecle espionage thriller of orientalist interest, but we should read it in the context of the cold war. It\u2019s presented as asymptotic to World War I: \u201cBritain wanted no part of France in the Nile Valley. M. Declasse, Foreign Minister of a newly formed French cabinet, would as soon go to war as not if there were any trouble when the two detachments met. As meet, everyone realized by now, they would. Kitchener had been instructed not to take any offensive and to avoid all provocation. Russia would support France in case of war, while England had a temporary rapprochement with Germany, which of course meant Italy and Austria as well\u201d (106). But: \u201cAll he asked was that eventually there be a war. Not just a small incidental skirmish in the race to carve up Africa, but one pip-pip, jolly ho, up-goes-the-balloon Armageddon for Europe\u201d (107). Finale of volume is the longest bit, involves a pack of rotters and race politics.Recommended for readers in varying stages of abomination, persons in so much rapture over the mongrel gods of Egypt, and those who\u2019d fled the eclipse then falling over Europe and their own hardly real shadow-states sometime back in the middle Thirties."], ["The most interesting aspect of this volume of short stories is the introduction by its author Thomas Pynchon. He's very funny and there is a certain amount of charm in how he looks at his work when he was young... and before he became the icon that he is now. The only book I have read all the way through is his last novel \"Inherent Vice\" which I loved, because it reminded me of my youth in Southern California and all the references both culturally and actual stores in actual locations are just perfect. The other book I love is \"Against the Day\" and I stopped reading it half-way through. Not due to the book itself, but I think more due to life at the time. It was such a rich experience to go through that book, and it is one of the few pieces of literature, where I thought this guy is actually a genius. And yes i will finish that book!The short stories here are very so-so, but has touches of his brilliance but not totally formed yet. I think the short story format is too restrictive for Pynchon - he needs the big scale 70mm book print to get his ideas across. And even that its difficult due to his narratives, which are deeply textured and not simple by any means. He's a writer where you really think about the research he has done and the way he conveys or writes his thoughts down on paper - it is not a book about his personal life, but the life that lives in his head."]], "review_count": "29", "description": "Compiling five short stories originally written between 1959 and 1964, \"Slow Learner \"showcases Thomas Pynchon's writing before the publication of his first novel \"V. \"The stories compiled here are \"The Small Rain,\" \"Low-lands,\" \"Entropy,\" \"Under the Rose,\" and \"The Secret Integration,\" along with an introduction by Pynchon himself. <br />", "author": "Thomas Pynchon"}, "Running Dog": {"average_rating": "3.42", "review": [["Looking down at Krok's comment (comment number 1 and the only comment as I write these words), I have to agree. Maybe not with the ultimate ranking of DeLillo novels, but this is a remarkably under-appreciated work. I doubt anyone has been paying attention, but I've been on a very slow and only periodically remembered task to read all of the DeLillo novels leading up to Underworld with the rough theory that Infinite Jest is a response or homage or a something to the pre-Underworld DeLillo. I meant to read them in order, but I realized I don't own Players yet, and the most recent troll on Karen's review of Underworld, made me want to dive back in to my mini-mission and I guess it's ok to skip a book, as long as I go back to it before I read Underworld. DFW updates from this book? Some similar themes, but nothing really new. The film that everyone is after feels like The Entertainment in the way people are reacting. Besides some characters feeling sort of similar to ones that DFW populates Infinite Jest with there wasn't anything as overt here as in Great Jones Street or End Zone (you can find my reviews for these in my shelves, I'm too lazy to link to them even though this is probably costing me a few votes). I've been a lazy and distracted reader lately so I might have missed things. The book? It's quite good. After Ratner's Star, which made me want to stab my eyes out with a rusty screwdriver rather than continue reading the book, this was great. I have some complaints, it feels a little underdeveloped. I think it's good as it is, but I feel like he could have done more with the characters, he has so many really good characters here but they are given a really limited amount of space to live in. This should have been his first BIG book, he had the story and the characters were more than just a series of quirky shadows spouting stylized dialogue like too many of the ones that populated RS. Maybe that is IJ's debt to this book, DFW gave the story line of the 'film' room to develop, I'm sort of grasping for straws here and I just thought of that, so I'm not sure if I stand behind it. Ignoring RS and not having read Players, I'm still going to say that DeLillo's early / 1970's work is great. Jimmy Cline, etc. made a comment on Karen's above mentioned review (he's not the troll), he said, \"I'm just conjecturing here, but it seems that his work does not age well at all, and that when his pomo navel-gazing gets at all over the top, the critics just pounce on him like rabid dogs. This is about Underworld, so I can't weigh in on that book, but I would say that DeLillo's early work is going to age quite well, he plays with some post-modern tricks in these early books, but he is more interested, it seems, in creating his own overly stylized version of America and the author, DeLillo, never appears to be making any appearances. Compared to the work of say John Barth, which mostly has aged as well as some hideous Park Avenue woman with too many face lifts and botox injections, there is still a freshness to the early (non RS(why is this one DeLillo's favorite early novel? Why?!?!) work. These early novels are quite good, maybe not developed as fully as they could be, maybe they could be longer and the themes delved into a bit deeper, the characters given some more room to stretch their legs and all of that, but they are still (in my not-so-humble opinion) some of the highlights of that dreary decade known as the 70's when authors appeared in book jackets wearing awful turtlenecks and people had key-parties and swinger orgies in between group readings of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Now on to the 1980's with DeLillo.Moll was suspicious of quests. At the bottom of most long and obsessive searches, in her view, was some vital deficiency on the part of the individual in pursuit, a meagerness of spirit.She sat in the dark, listening to Odell fiddle with the projector.Even more depressing than the nature of a given quest was the likely result. Whether people searched for an object of some kind, or inner occasion, or answer, or state of being, it was almost always disappointing. Nothing but themselves. Of course there were those who believed the search itself was all that mattered. The search itself is the reward."], ["The Graye ReportAn investigation has been conducted pursuant to your request and authorisation concerning \"Running Dog\", a novel written by the American author Don DeLillo, in order to ascertain the literary and other merits of the novel. The results of my investigation are set forth below under headings designed to facilitate your perusal and analysis.This report is made available to you at your express request, as you have employed me for that purpose. It is a privileged and confidential communication, and the information contained herein is not to be disclosed to others, verbally or otherwise.The EntranceI was driving an unmarked car north of Hudson. I hadn't expected to see a woman. Not after dark, on these streets. Coming this way, striding nicely. She had long hair, darkish blond, and from twenty yards, and closing, I could see how attractive she was. Her black coat was open, revealing a bright red dress. She was eye-catching all right. If she was in the business at all, she wasn't working streets. Easing up on the accelerator, I thought she was a discrepancy in the landscape. A welcome sight, sure, but also slightly disquieting - she didn't fit the picture.After she passed my car, I watched in the rearview mirror as she approached the demolition site, moving in that nice brisk sexy stride. A perennial all-pro, I thought. I figured I'd swing around the block and catch her again at the end of the same long street. With nothing better to do, I wanted a second look.I drove around the block and stopped. The street was empty. I let the car inch forward. No one in sight. It had taken me very little time to circle the block. At the rate she was walking she would have reached this part of the street right about now.The headlights picked up dust, a fairly heavy accumulation. It seemed to be coming from the second-story level of a construction scaffold in midblock. A possible discrepancy. No dust a couple of minutes ago. Dust now. Building should be unoccupied. Crew's gone home.I got out of the car. I went to the front of the building and took a look at the scaffolding. I felt the dust in my eyes and mouth. I hoisted myself up a series of interlocking rods and beams until I reached the second-story platform, about eighteen feet above street level. There was an unblocked window here, the one they used to empty the building of its contents. I directed the flashlight inside. It picked her out through clouds of plaster dust. She was on her back, vivid in the grey haze, head twisted to one side. There was blood still coming out of her, midbody, beneath the rib cage.I stepped through the window, and realised I had just entered a Don DeLillo novel.The SettingsDeLillo positioned his novel in six different settings:1. the art world;2. the networks of manufacture and distribution of pornography;3. the covert intelligence community;4. the American federal political environment;5. the family (the Mafia);6. the world of investigative journalism.You could call each of these worlds a \"System\" (if you were so inclined).As in Systems Theory, there is a boundary at which one system stops and another starts.You could say that this novel works at the boundaries where one system meets another.The SystemsWhether or not you agree with Tom LeClair that this is a \n\u201cSystems Novel\u201d,\n DeLillo gives us enough Systems clues to contemplate.The woman in the red dress in The Entrance (above) is actually a German transvestite male systems engineer called Christoph Ludecke.He has acquired the original and only copy of an allegedly pornographic home-movie featuring the occupants in Hitler\u2019s Berlin bunker shot in the last days of the Third Reich.Earl Mudger, a veteran with experience in special paramilitary programs run by Air Force Intelligence, commander of a fighter-bomber squadron in Korea and former Vice-President of Distribution at Process Management Systems in Oklahoma City (which specialised in production flow systems and automation), is now the head of a covert intelligence organisation code-named \u201cRadial Matrix\u201d, which has spun off from PAC/ORD (the Personnel Advisory Committee, Office of Records and Disbursements, which is now being investigated by a high level Senate Committee led by Senator Lloyd Percival):\u201cWhat you have in Mudger is the combination of business drives and lusts and impulses with police techniques, with ultrasophisticated skills of detection, surveillance, extortion, terror and the rest of it.\u201dIt turns out that Ludecke had done contract work for Radial Matrix.Mudger\u2019s wife is Vietnamese. He employs an assassination team of two former ARVN rangers (one, his wife\u2019s brother, Van, and the other, Cao) who are skilled with knives. It's possible that one of them might have killed Ludecke. Either way, it doesn't sound like a very effective systems management strategy to kill the only person who knows where the home-movie is.There are many more interesting characters, but you\u2019ll need to read this combination police procedural/espionage thriller to find out the details. Needless to say, most of them want to get their hands on the home-movie.The Sexual Conquests and Spiritual Quests\u201cMoll [Robbins] was suspicious of quests. At the bottom of most long and obsessive searches, in her view, was some vital deficiency on the part of the individual in pursuit, a meagerness of spirit.\u201dThe novel is broken into two narratives: one in which various characters are in pursuit of the movie, and the other where Glen Selvy (a former trainee of one of Mudger\u2019s operations and member of Senator Percival\u2019s staff responsible for advising on his art acquisitions) turns his back on the quest and seeks spiritual fulfilment in death (preceded by sex with the two main female characters, Moll Robbins [an investigative journalist with the alternative \u201cRunning Dog\u201d magazine] and Nadine Rademacher [a nude storyteller in a Manhattan sex shop]).The Nomenclaturist Novel: Don DeLillo as NomenclatouristThe thriller aspect of this novel is accomplished in its own right. However, as you would expect from DeLillo, there is a metaphysical aspect that is both challenging and equally rewarding.This sixth novel provides an opportunity to reflect on DeLillo\u2019s style and subject matter at a macro level. Here are some thoughts:Like DeLillo, at the beginning of a novel or perhaps even the beginning of a life, we start with a blank page, all is secret, all is mystery. We are curious about what lies in the world beyond the blank page. So we invent, add or find words. We name things, until we have created a world, a world formed and shaped by nomenclature. When we have only partly finished, there are still secrets, there is still mystery, but we often identify it as conspiracy. We know something, but not everything, of the relationships between people, or between people and things. There are still things for which we do not have words. The more information we acquire, the more we expect to possess knowledge and understanding, the more we expect mystery to recede. However, mystery has a way of persisting. It tends to outlast or survive history and science, for there will always be things beyond our understanding, things that still mystify us, things about which we remain curious, things which lure us into the mystic.SOUNDTRACK:(view spoiler)[Zabriskie Point - Final scenehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=guOmJM8...Roy Orbison - \"So Young\" (Love Theme From \"Zabriskie Point\") (1970)https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NZwdTkB...Beatles - \"Within you!

It has a breezy delivery with a great set of mysterious and colorful characters. I liked its stylish and ironic presentation, but all the suspense and action boils down to a shaggy dog story, which I personally don\u2019t favor. Others may appreciate better the little absurdities in the nefarious machinations of the secret power brokers behind the U.S. government and corporations, but in the light of the Iran-Contra scandal of the 80\u2019s the plot here is a bit tame. I was looking for something more over-the-top as part of a recent reading tour I took in search of exemplars of radical fiction.The tale begins with an Austrian trying to sell a film from the last days in Hitler\u2019s bunker to a dealer in erotic art, Lightborne. When the former gets murdered, interest in the film by various factions grows exponentially from the imagination of what its pornographic contents might be. Minions of a prominent U.S. senator and of a pornography empire run by the Mafia are two such factions with intense interest. Our erstwhile heroes on the case include a journalist, Moll Robbins, who does exposes and conspiracy stories for a DC magazine called \u201cRunning Dog\u201d, and Glen Selvy, who scouts out and buys erotic art for a senator\u2019s secret collection. A hot sexual relationship soon binds them together, a bond sealed when they escape a machine gun attack on a bar where they are chatting. His expert responses and handy work with a pistol reveals to her that he must be no ordinary staffer.Here is a delightful snatch of dialog between them in the middle of the night after relieving their tension:\u201cWho are you, Selvy?\u201dHe sat back in his chair, an intentional countermotion, a withdrawal, and smiled in deep fatigue, self-deprecatingly. He speared to be dissociating himself from whatever significance the question by its nature ascribed to him.\u201d\u2026\u201dWhat is it like, secrecy? The secret life. I know it\u2019s sexual. I want to know this. Is it homosexual?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re way ahead of me,\u201d he said.\u201cIsn\u2019t it why they seem so good at it, which comes to the same thing. Isn\u2019t it almost rooted in national character?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know the English controlled world rights.\u201d\u201cTo what?\u201d\u201cBeing queer, \u201c he said.\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying the link is there. That\u2019s all. Tendency finds an outlet. I\u2019m saying espionage is a language, an art, with sexual sources and coordinates. Although I don\u2019t mean to say it so Freudianly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019, open to theorizing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else do you have?\u201d\u201cI have links inside of links. This is the age of conspiracy.\u201d\u201cPeople have wondered.\u201dIt turns out that the senator is heading up a closed-door Congressional investigation of the abuses of PAC/ORD, an acronym for the equally obfuscating \u201cPersonnel Advisory Committee, Office of Records and Disbursements\u201d (don\u2019t you love DeLillo\u2019s names?). Apparently its benign role in administering the budgetary operations of the entire intelligence enterprise is a front includes some funding of operations beyond the purview of legislative oversight. What we come to learn is that its spawn for funding covert operations, Radial Matrix, has gone rogue, a transformation made possible by its development of its own money-making schemes. Kudos for prescience on that. (view spoiler)[Recall how a decade later Maine Colonel Olliver North sold arms to Iran to facilitate release of American prisoners and used the money raised to support the Contras war against the leftist Sandanistas in Nicaragua and generate more funds for them through the drug operations run by Panamanian president Noriega. (hide spoiler)]The reader is at sea over the intersection of the quest for Nazi film and the brewing conflicts over exposure of secret intelligence operations. All we know for a long time is that someone powerful wants to shut Selvy or Moll down. Selvy in fact may or may not work for Radial Matrix or may or may not be a target for a hit. Moll has free reign either to uncover the story about the senator\u2019s porn art obsession or the story about the PAC/ORD investigation, so she works toward both, using her feminine allure to draw upon the senator\u2019s lust for her. She also tracks down the mastermind of Radial Matrix, Earl Mudge, who has a similar weakness for her charms. Brilliant cat and mouse between Moll and Mudge. DeLillo gives him wonderful quirks, such as an avid hobby of creating a zoo in Vietnam when he ran the CIA contracted operations of Air America and his current metallurgic engineering of lucrative munitions at his current mansion in Virginia. Moll\u2019s boss at Running Dog is compromised in her direction under blackmail threats, but is still able to convey her overall outlook to her: \u201cWant to hear my theory? \u2026All men are criminals. All women are Mafia wives. \u2026I was married to the same man for eleven years. I did his bidding. Not fully realizing. His silent bidding. Somehow, mysteriously, unspokenly. It\u2019s built into the air between us. It\u2019s carried on radio waves from galaxy to galaxy. \u2026The ultimate genius of men. Do you care to know what it is? Men want. Women just hang around. Women think they\u2019re steaming along on a tremendous career, toot toot. Nothing. Nowhere. I\u2019m telling you. Men want. Bam, crash, pow. The impact, good Christ. Men want so badly. It makes us feel a little spacey, a little dizzy. What are we next to this great want, this universal bloodsucking need of theirs? DeLillo has some fun painting the post-Vietnam character of Washington, DC, and New York City as a backdrop to his tale. We end with a cinematic fade to the American West and the Mexican border with Selvy on the run toward some kind of showdown. Like James Bond, he doesn\u2019t neglect picking up a new playmate for a travel companion on the way. What does it mean that his pursuers turn out to Vietnamese? What is the outcome of the quest for the Nazi smut movie? Enquiring minds want to know, but will you be satisfied with the answer?This book reminds me a lot of William Gibson\u2019s espionage books (the so-called Blue Ant series). For both I appreciated their flow, cool, crisp dialog, and odd characters. Yet both leave a lot of their implications to hand-waving. DeLillo admits in interviews covered in Wikipedia he regrets not spending more effort on this and others of his early period (supposedly Running Dog was written in a four-month period). I\u2019ve only read two works from the apogee of his arc, \u201cWhite Noise\u201d (1985), which mystified me with its dissection of consumerism and obsession with death, and \u201cUnderworld\u201d (1997), which felt like a masterful take on paranoia and the Cold War. I look forward to reading more of his work, which includes quite a variety of subjects."], ["This strikes me as an important and often-overlooked book in the chain of early DeLillo's events, and indeed a necessary stop for anyone curious as to how he got from Americana to White Noise. DeLillo's early novels, particularly the trio of End Zone, Great Jones Street and Ratner's Star, feature these long stretches where DeLillo wanders away from his plots (never the tightest in the world even at his peak, not like it's a big deal (I almost typed \"beak deal.\" I'm a silly person) or anything) and decides instead to explore whichever ideas he's trying to get across, as well as some brand-shittin'-new ideas that don't seem to have much connection with what's at hand; think the underwear-sharing episode in Great Jones Street or a bulk of Ratner's Star (End Zone isn't as guilty, if guilty's even the word I'm looking for). This tendency of his can be charming as hell, and the discussions are pretty much always intelligent, but you sometimes have to wonder how much control the guy had over his early work; they're, objectively speaking, pretty self-indulgent books. And it's not like DeLillo was ever the tightest novelist in the world, but unless Players beat this one to the punch, Running Dog strikes me as the book where DeLillo started to pay more attention to plot, to the chain of events itself. This style would hit its peak with Libra, which I think is the most streamlined of the man's novels, or maybe the underrated Cosmopolis. It's not like DeLillo's ever going to strip his books down to just the barest facts that make understanding his narrative possible, and I don't think he'd be the same if he ever did, but at the same point, I don't think he ever would've broken through to his current major novelist status if he hadn't worked a little heavier in the x, therefore y, therefore z mode. In White Noise, for example, the Airborne Toxic Event hits, toxic chemicals from it enter Jack Gladney's system, Jack Gladney finds and steals Barbara's Dylar, revelations about the Dylar come to light. If you think I'm banking on you having read a decent amount of DeLillo here, you're right; it's hard to imagine anyone who isn't already a DeLillo fan reading reviews of this book. Anyway, to business. Running Dog is a thriller. If I'm not mistaken about Players, it's DeLillo's second. He likes this mode; the Names, Libra, and Mao II all also fit into it. I generally don't like thrillers, but DeLillo's no mere airport novelist, and while aficionados of the genre might argue that he's too chilly to get the requisite suspense across, he more than makes up for it with the profound sense of dread and paranoia in his novels. This one's notable for packing so much of it in that the novel feels like it's ready to explode; it's fascinating to see how convoluted things get as the characters circle closer to the Hitler sex tape at the center of all this. Don't be fooled for a minute into thinking this book is as puerile as it could've been given its subject matter, by the way; as usual, DeLillo has a lot to say. Here it's about eroticism and fascism. And he does it with more forward motion than he had with his previous novels. Plus there's the usual virtues of DeLillo's novels: the calculated prose, each word seemingly weighted for maximum impact; the deadpan humor; the remarkably original concepts. You might want a character sheet, what with all these organizations stepping on each other's toes, and there isn't a lot by way of resolution, but DeLillo's fans can't go wrong."], ["Alla ricerca del film porno (del F\u00fchrer ) perdutoPi\u00f9 che una ricerca \u00e8 una vera e propria caccia , e parecchio movimentata anche , che ritmo ! segreti ,giochi di potere , realt\u00e0 inverosimili e apparenze plausibili , inseguimenti , spari ,coltelli , corpo a corpo dialoghi vivaci e serrati , intriganti e che personaggi !su tutti Glen , cane che corre  il suo nome indiano con i suoi freddi occhi grigi, quella strana aura pallida, quel senso di implacabilit\u00e0 .

Running Dog is a stripped-down 1970s thriller of wry paranoia. It alternates between several characters' viewpoints as they compete to acquire a film, possibly pornographic, shot in Hitler's bunker at the end of World War II.The novel's heroine is Moll Robbins, a journalist for the ironically-named radical magazine Running Dog. \"Running dog\" is a phrase from the Maoist lexicon, a term of abuse for capitalism's supposed servants, as in \"running dogs of capital.\" \"Capitalist lackeys and running dogs,'\" says one of the characters to Moll, glossing the magazine's name. She answers, \"'Someone remembers,'\" a rueful reply as I read it, not only a cynical comment on the folly of youth but perhaps also an elegy for expired radical dreams. Moll is, to my mind, much the most interesting character in Running Dog, the most novelistically inward\u2014as indicated by her name, which combines pioneering novelist Daniel Defoe's most famous protagonists, Moll Flanders and Robinson Crusoe, those exemplary modern individuals who had to make their own way through a newly interconnected and money-dominated world, alone within society and before God, no tradition to guide them. But DeLillo's Moll comes after, not before, inwardness; all that's left in DeLillo of the modernist dream of psychological depth is a droll self-consciousness, a weird writers' view of the world: \"The shirt accentuated her height in ways she found interesting.\" DeLillo's later work will achieve greatness in exploring this sensibility. In Running Dog (his sixth novel and, I must confess, the earliest I've read), he is not quite there yet.Other seekers of the Hitler film whom the novel uses as viewpoint characters include the endearing elderly gentleman Lightborne, who runs the gallery Cosmic Erotics; Earl Mudger, a vaguely comic take on a postmodern Mistah Kurtz type, a military contractor who brought back an entourage from Vietnam and who is now obsessed with making knives; Lomax, some kind of deep-state agent who meets his contacts in a black limousine; Lloyd Percival, a senator who collects rare erotica; Talerico, a mafia boss with facial paralysis who operates out of Toronto; and probably more I'm forgetting. These are the fauna of the thriller and the detective novel, colorful gargoyles to adorn the plot architecture. They are entertaining enough but eventually tiresome, at least if you are not a devotee of those genres.The novel's main hero, perhaps even more than Moll, is Glen Selvy, a man so well-trained as a deep-cover espionage agent (he is the real \"running dog\") that there is almost nothing left of him but his nearly mystical absorption in a pared-down routine:He was a reader. He read his man. There was nothing cynical in his view of the world. He didn't feel tainted by the dirt of his profession. It was a calculated existence, this. He preferred life narrowed down to unfinished rooms.This, I suppose, is an attempt to lend some aesthetic dignity to the super-spy/super-detective/super-hero archetype, especially as Selvy moves toward his inevitable end, undergoing a kind of ritual purification. I don't find it an entirely successful gesture: DeLillo takes a figure that belongs in an exaggerated aesthetic environment and tries to fit him into a novel that, for all its thriller trappings, still works in the mode of Flaubert. Hemingway is perhaps DeLillo's model here, but Papa's heroes were common soldiers, fighters, etc., not super-spies. An air of camp, though, hangs over the whole novel, from its now-offensive beginning, where a man dressed as a woman falls to his death (we later learn that he is the source of the Hitler film). So perhaps I am the one taking Selvy too seriously. Still, when I want Batman, I want Batman, and when I want Flaubert, I want Flaubert. I respect Running Dog's attempt to create a synthesis but find it unpersuasive. When compared to the extraordinary Lee Harvey Oswald of DeLillo's Libra, Selvy in his cartoonish extremism vanishes.While allowing for DeLillo's correct assessment that Running Dog is not \"utterly serious,\" I think it does gather itself into an argument. That so many authority figures in the novel desire a Hitler porn movie suggests a secret yearning among the elite, government and criminal, to believe in fascism's self-advertisement as the politics of self-annihilating ecstasy. Without spoiling the conclusion, I can say that the novel shows fascism up as a far more conventional, even sentimental affair, not an aesthetic sublime in the least. And whatever nostalgia the novel may harbor for the '60s dream, DeLillo is also aware of how that dream was commodified into irrelevance, turned into traditional authority's loyal opposition:\"Who do you work for?\" Selvy said.\"Running Dog,\" she said.He paused briefly.\"One-time organ of discontent.\"\"We were fairly radical, yes.\"\"Now safely established in the mainstream.\"\"I wouldn't say safely.\"\"Part of the ever-expanding middle.\"\"We say 'fuck' all the time.\"\"My point exactly.\"Fuck all the time: the connection of sex to power, the search for an escape from \"the ever-expanding middle.\" And the novel occasionally suggests that sex itself is a kind of fascism, echoing Sontag's classic essay on Leni Riefenstahl from three years before the novel's publication. Such hints\u2014as when the source of the Hitler film is revealed as a \"transvestite\" (in the parlance of the times) or when Moll suggests that homosexuality is natural to an imperial elite (as in English public schools)\u2014will no doubt offend the contemporary reader schooled in queer hermeneutics. On the other hand, in the novel's most arresting passage, a passage of far more relevance now than when the novel was published in 1978, Mudger explains that technological developments create an appetite for transgression:\"When technology reaches a certain level, people begin to feel like criminals,\" he said. \"Someone is after you, the computers maybe, the machine-police. You can't escape investigation. The facts about you and your whole existence have been collected or are being collected. Banks, insurance companies, credit organizations, tax examiners, passport officers, reporting services, police agencies, intelligence gatherers. It's a little like I was saying before. Devices make us pliant. If they issue a print-out saying we're guilty, then we're guilty. But it goes even deeper, doesn't it? It's the presence alone, the very fact, the superabundance of technology, that makes us feel we're committing crimes.\"In my Inherent Vice review, I alluded to T. S. Eliot's treatment of the occult in The Waste Land: he seemed to see it as a rich source of imagery, even one to which some authentic spiritual yearning could be attached, but also a body of lore that it would be insane to take literally. I think this describes DeLillo's approach to conspiracy and other forms of apocalyptic thought, including the mystique of sexual transgression. These are images he returns to, again and again, to make his art; but the art itself is the real riposte to the omnipresence of technology, to the machine-police that estrange us from ourselves. Because this insight is not quite articulated in Running Dog, as it will be in Libra or Underworld\u2014because in fact a somewhat bathetic super-heroic tragedy, only half meant in earnest, is substituted for it\u2014I can't say that this is one of DeLillo's best novels. Then again, he mined it again and again for his later fiction: White Noise's Hitler motif, Libra's Dallas-tending conspiracies, Underworld's and The Body Artist's bold female intellectuals, Cosmopolis's pursuit of an exterior to capitalist technocracy\u2014all are present in Running Dog. Not bad for four months' work.Finally, the DeLillo dialogue is here in all its stylized dueling-monologue comedy. It has always reminded me of Wilde. You either love it or hate it, and I love it:\"Are you as sluggish as I am?\"\"No,\" he said.\"It's my biorhythms. They're way out of whack today.\"\"I'm great, I'm tuned.\"\"Biorhythmically I feel awful.\"\"You need a swim,\" he said.And the DeLillo prose-poetry is here (though sometimes held up by too much genre-fiction exposition), the voice of a bewildered aesthete entranced at the postmodern spectacle. I will end where the novel begins:You won't find ordinary people here. Not after dark, on these streets, under the ancient warehouse canopies. Of course you know this. This is the point. It's why you're here, obviously. Wind comes gusting off the river, stirring the powdery air of demolition sites. Derelicts build fires in rusty oil drums near the piers. You see them clustered, wrapped in whatever variety of coat or throwaway sweater or combination of these they've been able to acquire. There are trucks parked near the warehouses, some of them occupied, men smoking in the dimness, waiting for the homosexuals to make their way down from the bars above Canal Street. You lengthen your stride, although not to hurry out of the cold. You like that stiffening wind. You turn a corner and move briefly into it, feeling your thighs take shape against the dress's pleasurably taut weave. Broken glass shines like white mica in the vacant lots. The river has a musky tang tonight."], ["Running Dog is your typical contemporary thriller. It does not concentrate on postmodernism, stream of consciousness, or existentialism. It rather follows a journalist (what better to develop a thriller?) who seeks to uncover a mystery, and she did not expect to find what she found. I'm not sure I appreciate how Hitler was portrayed in this, but I liked the message behind it.\u00a0History is True"], ["Even by DeLillo standards, Running Dog is a strange beast. A radical journalist investigates rumors of a pornographic movie featuring Adolf Hitler, which leads her into a tangle of corrupt politicians and smut peddlers, government officials and Vietnamese death squads. Structurally it's much more conventional than your average DeLillo work, resembling the paranoid thrillers so popular in the mid-'70s, but at service of an utterly weird plot whose strands don't entirely coalesce. Ultimately it fades into familiar thematic threads of much ado about nothing: money is spent, ink is spilled blood is shed and reputation ruined, all for a weird relic of dubious authenticity.

But the fact remains that Auster is always an enjoyable read--wrangling memories, the self, and being a flaneur, wherever that may be.The book carries an interview piece with Auster and his producer for at least a few pages regarding the adaptation and how he came to write about \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost.\" While I am not a fan of what seems to be a disclaimer or a background piece, as this could have been inserted after the screenplay, the interview rather pre-empts what transpires in the narrative. When Martin Frost wakes up with a stranger one morning, he realizes that what he might be missing in this drive to work on his manuscript seems to stem from his lack of affection. He finds this in the form of a woman, who may or may not exist in the physical world. The days pass by and Martin continues to work diligently, seemingly inspired by this strangers. But as it turns out, it was not only him who is experiencing this phenomenon. Could this be a part of himself that is projected in his life at the moment? Or is Martin living inside his head? The descriptions are quite cinematic in nature, walking in and out of the visual elements such as the space, the look of the characters, several close up and wide shots on the area and the personalities involved. Althroughout the book, the notion on how memories can either be destructive or beneficial to an artist rings true, and the authors plays with them quite well as you keep questioning the merits of the physical and the imagined."], ["Paul Auster es uno de mis autores favoritos.

But seeing a bit of silent film comedy on TV, he takes up the task of examining and writing a book about the work of one comedic genius from the 20\u2019s. Soon after the book is published the wife of the supposedly dead film-maker contacts Zimmer to ask if he might like to meet the man himself. There is much parallelism here, Zimmer with both Hector Mann, the ancient film-maker and Chateaubriand, the author of a lengthy autobiography that Zimmer is translating. In a way all three are dead. Zimmer and Mann had both attempted suicide. And a character in the book ultimately succeeds in such an attempt.What is real and what is illusion? Hector had been in the business of illusion, then had to present an illusion of himself for most of his life. His film The Life of Martin Frost echoes the book\u2019s theme of illusion. Sometimes an illusion can be a helpful thing, as when Zimmer is comforted by Alma on the plane (see below).There is a passage in which Mann spots what he believes to be a blue stone on the street. He has a detailed plan of what he will do with it, alive with human connection, only to find that it is a gob of spit. Yet the imagining was enough to alter his life course. Maybe illusions are what we tell ourselves, what we need, in order to survive. I enjoyed the book very much. It was a fast read, engaging, with interesting characters and enough suspense to sustain a level of tension. There was, perhaps, too little told of Hector\u2019s wife and why she does what she does. Well, Auster does explain, but I found it unconvincing. I wish that I had kept better track of characters. No, there are not hordes of them. I just wish that I had tracked the braiding of the stories. There is much interweaving here, much that occurs for some that also occur for others.

As with the other Auster I've read (I know I've only read 2 Austers, I am such a failure at being pretentious), I finished this and I was like... what, why did I read this?To explain myself I should say that I follow the Roger Ebert school of criticism. Roger Ebert cares more about how a movie makes him feel than on its technical merits. Granted, this is rather less valid in the medium of words on a page than the sound and fury of film, but I still stick to it. I have no problem trashing Plath's Bell-jar, regardless of its supposed literary merit or historical significance, because it bored and annoyed me.But getting to the point of this book, let me break it down for you literary thugs: there is a man whose family dies in an accident. He is depressed, but then he sees a silent comedy on TV and laughs for the first time in long while. He then decides to write about the star of this silent comedy, a man named Hector Mann. In the course of this, he finds out that Hector Mann disappeared, but he may actually still be alive!!! Stuff ensues, there are some themes brought up, there's some angst, there's some sex, you know the drill. And don't worry none of that's spoiler material, all on the first page basically.Worth reading for a few pieces of stellar writing. I was particularly impressed by how Auster writes about a film that doesn't actually exist. I bought into it, I was convinced. It's a story within a story (within a story within a story ad nauseam), and it's true that the inner stories are better told than the outer ones. I'm cool with that.In summary, though: \"Paul Auster, you bastard!\" is my review. If you likewise enjoy calling famous authors bastards, then I recommend this book to you highly.As a side note, a result of this novel, I had to add a new shelf called \"bepretentious.\" Just read some of the other, actually useful reviews and you'll see what I mean."], ["By reading this book I have become a die-hard Auster fan. The man is amazing. So clever, so imaginitive, so poetic and almost profound. This book rambles, and in doing so touches on so many intertwined narratives that one almost gives up on what was assumed to be the original plot and assumes the opening catch phrase was just another Paul Auster smoke screen story line. But this one, even in creating such an intricatedly woven network of a character experiences, never looses sight of its ultimate goal - to explain how the supposed disapearance of a silent film actor affected the life of a professor and widower from Detroit. The world created in this book is done with such care and is so full of unexpected and tangential details that I found myself wondering if I wasn't perhaps reading a work of historical fiction rather than just a plain old novel. It's an amazingly well crafted narrative, heartwrenching and hopeful at the same time.

Men whose realities take a turn towards the vague, so much so, that they seem to dress themselves in the vagueness that surrounds them. Men who lose everything or men who never really had anything to begin with. Men who seem to be caught for good inside an illusion along with everyone that surrounds them. Now they\u2019re here, now they\u2019re not. There are two of those men in The Book of Illusions: the narrator and Hector Man. Bound to each other, they meet only for an hour toward the end but the echo of their meeting is present after as much as before the event.What strange time for me to read this particular book! By the end of the first chapter it had grabbed me by the neck. What\u2019s weird is that my present state has something of the book\u2019s essence.

I regret, however, that my own illusions take up much of my mental capacity nowadays, which proved unable to fully embrace this haunting novel. Not that I regret the illusions themselves. Where would the point in that be, after all?It\u2019s haunting, intense, and filled with a melancholy that sticks on your fingers with every page that you turn. There\u2019s a kind of sadness in the very idea of illusions, and Auster sure took great advantage of that. It\u2019s the idea that everything you have can disappear in the blink eye. Something precious falls into our arms and we call it a miracle. One day, we open our eyes and it\u2019s gone. Then, it\u2019s a tragedy. The worst is that, once it\u2019s gone, one can never be sure if it was ever even there.Don\u2019t be fooled, The Book of Illusions is so much more than my clouded mind can produce right now.

This famous question is closely examined in \"The Book of Illusions,\" by author Paul Auster, as he tells the story of literature professor David Zimmer, who copes with the death of his wife and two sons by shutting out the real world so that he can inhabit the \"silent world of Hector Mann,\" an obscure actor from the 1920s. After leaving a dozen movies behind that nobody seems to know about, Hector disappeared in 1929, presumed dead. However, it turns out he is actually alive in New Mexico, paying penance for the role he played in the accidental death of his girlfriend \u2013 vowing never to make another movie and eventually only agreeing to make movies if they will be destroyed immediately upon his death and never be seen by an audience. According to Hector\u2019s rationale, if he makes a movie and nobody sees it, then his movie does not exist. But is this true? Does an idea have to be shared \u2013 and experienced by others \u2013 to exist and take on meaning? Although he provides confusing answers throughout the work, first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others.At first, Auster suggests Hector can attain greatness on his own, even without an audience. When Hector Mann disappears, his film career is pretty much over due to the invention of sound in movies and his heavy accent. His last major film, \"Mr. Nobody,\" is a response to the frustration he feels about his career, as, in the film, his character takes a magic potion that makes him invisible. Eventually, he is reborn as a new person, and, facing himself in the mirror, he confronts the fact of his own annihilation with an exuberant smile \u2013 the last image of Hector Mann that will be seen by audiences, seemingly content with the idea he is \"no longer the Hector Mann who has amused us and entertained us.\" Similarly, in his own life, Hector is forced to disappear after his girlfriend is killed, and, to disguise himself, he loses his trademark mustache, so that he is \"the spitting image of Mr. Nothing himself.\" In his new life, Hector no longer makes movies, but instead works odd jobs and focuses on reading, writing, learning English, and planting trees. In his journals, Hector writes, \"I talk only to the dead now. They are the only ones I trust, the only ones who understand me.\" Hector no longer shares himself with an audience \u2013 Hector Mann has been annihilated \u2013 but, according to his biographer and friend Alma, he is closer to greatness than ever before: \"[T]he further he traveled from his point of origin, she said, the closer he came to achieving greatness. [. . . ]Even now, he still talks about the trees as his greatest accomplishment. Better than his films, she says, better than anything else he\u2019s ever done.\" In this reading of Hector\u2019s life, based on the interpretation of \"Mr. Nobody,\" Hector is the only voice that matters; even without an audience, he can still attain greatness.However, a later film, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost,\" questions this notion that artists can attain greatness without sharing their work with others. In this movie, which Hector made after his disappearance with the promise it would never be released to an audience, is different from his earlier work: it is serious, not a comedy, and Hector does not act in it. In the movie, Martin Frost, a writer, must destroy his work to save the life of his girlfriend Claire. After she is brought back to life and realizes what has happened, she erupts in tears, asking Martin if he realizes what\u2019s he done and desperately wondering what they are going to do now. The movie ends ambiguously with her questions and no answers from Martin. Similarly, after Hector\u2019s death, his wife Frieda destroys everything \u2013 his movies, his journals, and even the manuscript of a biography his friend Alma had been working on for seven years \u2013 in a \"precise reenactment of the final scene of Martin Frost.\" Pondering Frieda\u2019s actions, David thinks about Hector\u2019s sacrifice of \"the one thing that would have given his work meaning \u2013 the pleasure of sharing it with others,\" but then realizes that, in Frieda\u2019s mind, \"It was about making something in order to destroy it. That was the work, and until all evidence of the work had been destroyed, the work would not exist. It would come into being only at the moment of its annihilation.\" In Frieda\u2019s interpretation, work was not created for others; in fact, sharing Hector\u2019s work with others would cause it to lose its meaning. However, ultimately, both of Auster\u2019s protagonists \u2013 David Zimmer and Hector Mann \u2013 seem to repudiate Frieda and believe that Hector\u2019s work does not lose meaning if it is shared with others. When Alma had first told David about her biography of Hector, he was initially skeptical: \"It\u2019s one thing to unburden himself to you, but a book is for the world, and as soon as he tells his story to the world, his life becomes meaningless.\" In other words, a book exists not for the author or subject but for readers, and by sharing himself with them, Hector could lose himself. He would exist as they saw him, and not as he really was \u2013 their illusions of him would become reality. When David questions Hector about why he would want to give himself away like that, Hector answers, \"Why should it bother me to turn myself into an example for others? [. . . .] You laughed, Zimmer. Perhaps others will begin to laugh with you.\" These words \u2013 the last Hector speaks in the book \u2013 show his realization of the positive impact his work can have on others, as he comes to the conclusion that his earlier films, if they made David laugh, were \"perhaps the greatest good\" he had done. David ultimately seems to embrace Hector\u2019s viewpoint, hoping that others will laugh with him, as he takes pleasure when Hector\u2019s silent comedies are put out on video and becomes an honorary member of a fan club, the International Brotherhood of Hector Manniacs. Most of all, he hopes that someday the lost films of Hector Mann \u2013 the ones that Frieda destroyed \u2013 will be found somehow so others can enjoy them like he did, \"and the story will start all over again. I live with that hope.\" In order to have meaning, Hector\u2019s films must be shared with others. Unlike Frieda, David believes that Hector\u2019s films should be shared with the world. Although he provides confusing answers throughout \"The Book of Illusions,\" first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others. Like the confusing answers to the question of the movie that nobody sees, \"The Book of Illusions\" is full of other confusing themes and contradictions. For example, one major theme of the book is the effect of chance and how small circumstances can have a significant impact on our lives. However, while there are some small circumstances which impact the action in the book, for the most part, the major events are more like contrived and implausible plot devices \u2013 an ex-girlfriend killed by a current girlfriend, a wife and two sons lost in a plane crash, David held at gunpoint so that he will watch a movie, a tough fall resulting in another death, a suicide, a possible murder. Are these really \"small circumstances\" of chance? Moreover, while this issue of fate is explored in depth like the meaning of one\u2019s work, the two themes are never tied together. In Auster\u2019s telling, both Hector and David cope with loss by turning to art but they are not reborn again except through accidents of fate, so that the one seemingly resolved idea in the book \u2013 the issue of the movie nobody hears \u2013 becomes irrelevant compared to the greater themes of fate and rebirth. The interplay between the various themes is never explored, and it is easy to get confused as all of these ideas are presented, but are often contradicted and never fully resolved, leading a reader to ponder the 2001 Atlantic Monthly article\u2019s criticism of Paul Auster: \"[He] knows the prime rule of pseudo-intellectual writing: the harder it is to be pinned down on any idea, the easier it is to conceal that one has no ideas at all.\" In light of the questions asked in \"The Book of Illusions,\" it is easy to wonder: if an author throws out a lot of different ideas but never resolves them, so that readers can\u2019t understand what those ideas are, do the ideas actually exist?"], ["David Zimmer is a teacher and writer whose wife and two young sons have been killed in an aeroplane crash. At his lowest ebb, suicidal and alcoholic, David sees a silent film on television and laughs for the first time since the tragedy. Thereafter, he develops a fascination with the actor featured in the old movie, Hector Mann - a minor star of silent comedies who vanished in 1929 and was never seen or heard of again. Travelling around the world in order to visit the film archives containing Hector's few movies, David channels his obsession into a book about the actor's work. However, the story really begins some time after this, when David receives a mysterious letter containing some startling news about Hector.The Book of Illusions displays many characteristics of Auster's typical style, most noticeably the constant presence of symbolism, the perceived significance of art and the line between reality and (as the title suggests) illusion. Here, rather than the emphasis being on language and writing, the focus is on Hector's films and their visual impact, though of course the power of storytelling is still key. When David discovers that Hector made some films that were never seen by anyone else, he questions whether art has any importance if it is not shared with and experienced by an audience. David's ruminations are mirrored in various ways throughout the narrative - David withdraws from life, shuts himself away and becomes invisible, so it seems ironic that he becomes obsessed with a silent movie star; Hector makes a film called 'Mr. Nobody' in which he literally becomes invisible, and then, in his real life, he disappears; another character, Alma, is made more visible by a large birthmark on her face, yet she feels this gives her the ability to instantly see others' true characters through their reactions to her appearance.There are elements of the story that are, from a distance, completely implausible. The manner of David and Alma's first meeting is really quite ridiculous, and certainly unbelievable, as is the speedy development of their relationship. But I think this is where the genius of Auster's writing really lies, in suspending the reader's disbelief and immersing you so deeply into the story that these strange events seem believable. I can imagine that the book won't work for everyone - some may find the lengthy descriptions of unseen, nonexistent films dull (I really enjoyed them), and there's a curious... quietness about it all - a very subdued feel. This is not a deeply thrilling novel, more of a restrained but haunting little tale. On balance I think I personally prefer Oracle Night, but there is plenty to recommend this story, especially for fans of the author. (If you're not already acquainted with Auster, I'd still recommend The New York Trilogy as a primer.)"], ["\u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b6\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 True Detective: \"To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing.

I love Christmas. When Christmas comes we have a large tree and my husband climbs up into the attic to get our green and red Christmas boxes down, and then we really decorate.I put the book away, but then I noticed that Hallmark channel was showing Christmas movies and have for a while. My husband remarked upon it, mentioning how they were having Christmas in July. It was then that I thought of another Christmas in July, and I thought to read this beautifully illustrated book whose pictures I wish to live in, because I love quaint little towns. Here is a picture of Brooklyn, N.Y. where this book is set:Perhaps one of these buildings is Auggie Cigar/magazine store. One day when Auggie was in his shop, a teenager came in to shoplift. He wasn\u2019t stealing cigars for gifts, no, he was taking magazines. Auggie came after him so he ran out of the store, dropping his wallet in the process. Auggie picked up his wallet and instead of giving it to the police, he saved it, and he must have thought about it for a long time. Then on Christmas day he thought to take it over to the address in the wallet. A sweet Christmas story begins, and I should not say, begins, because the entire story is sweet, it is giving, and it is a book that I will read every year along with Truman Capote\u2019s Christmas Memory, and One Christmas, and then A Christmas Cup of Tea. But I have another story. Years ago one of my friends and I used to go to Julian, California, because we loved the quaint town in the mountains where they grew apple trees and had cafes like Granny\u2019s Kitchen where on one snowy Christmas season we sat at a table near their wood stove eating a piece of apple pie.  We also used to have apple pie at another caf\u00e9, The Julian Pie Co. whose pies are sold all over San Diego Co. They also made apple cider cake donuts that we couldn\u2019t resist. Next we would walk over to The Old Julian Bookstore. You, the reader, know what fun it is to walk into an old bookstore and browse for hours. This day in July, my friend I decided to have Italian food. We walked into Romano\u2019s and sat down at one of their window tables. The waitress began telling us a story that I will never forget. The Episcopal Church is next door to them, right up the hill, and one day in July, the priest came in to have lunch and a few glasses of wine. Then he went back up the hill to his church, and shortly thereafter the church bells rang out Christmas music that could be heard all over town. What a wonderful priest, I thought. We should have gone up the hill to meet him. What a nice gift to give to the town\u2019s people.The Old Julian BookstoreThe Julian Pie Company"], ["Lovely story, great writing, beautiful visuals.

tale, the brilliant film Smoke derives, and if you have not seen that beautiful masterpiece of drama and comedy, I beg you to seek it out as soon as possible. Auster somehow started his sort of dip into the cinematic form with what I believe to be one of the greatest movies ever made, so check that one out! This story is told at the end of the film by the character Auggie Wren, played wonderfully by Harvey Keitel, and is a nearly word by word clone of that which was originally written down. Without the presence of these wonderful performances, there is a certain emptiness here that is completely filled up in the film, which sounds like it would be more fitting than it is. However, this story is still something of a must read, particularly for big fans of Auster's work as well as those who just want to read an excellent shory story that is unsentimental but still heartfelt like nothing else you have ever before."], ["This is an easy read, but it\u2019s kind of a pointless story. Basically, the author is asked to write a story about Christmas for the New York Times and doesn\u2019t know what to write, so his friend tells him a story about Christmas, and he isn\u2019t sure whether or not it is true"], ["I went to the library today to watch a VHS tape of my work for a class. But when I got there, they told me that they don't let people watch their own VHS tapes, only tapes from the library. I asked why and they told me that if people could just bring in their own tapes and watch them they would never stop. Yup. Good thing the librarians are keeping a handle on things because we wouldn't want crazy people like me camping out in the library with their homework. Guess I'm supposed to go buy a TV and VCR.Anyway, no big deal about the tape, I'll find somewhere else to watch it and I had an application I wanted to fax. No fax machine at the library though. I though copiers and fax machines would be par for the course, but not so much. So I decided to get one of the books off my to-read list. But it was checked out. Oh..... Didn't want the whole trip to be a waste so I went downstairs to the fiction section and decided to wander around until I found a book.I know you're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but I have never heard anything about its spine. And that is exactly what I did. I knew I didn't want anything too long (heavy to take on Muni) so when I saw this tiny red spine with perky black capital letters, I was intrigued.Turns out the book is illustrated which seemed like a sign since the book I had initially wanted was also illustrated. I really didn't like the illustrations as part Auggie Wren. The art itself (by Isol who I cna only imagine must be a well known artist to go by only one name) has a strong graphic quality and pallet that reminds me of the art in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Stories. But the pictures, especially of the people, seem inspired by the words rather than lifelike. I found myself trying very hard not to look at them until after I finished each page. They were jarring to the very end of the story.But the writing itself was lovely. I really felt as though someone was speaking to me the entire time. The sentences are spare but evocative and the subject is entertaining. Something about the writing reminded me of Capote's stories. Anyway, this is a wonderful book that I read rather quickly and I think deserves a more leisurely read because I think I would get new layers out of it. At 36 pages (half of which are illustrations) it's a perfect read for those of you with busy lives. Let me know what you think of it."], ["This slim book and I go back about four years. I picked it up that summer at a library book sale where I was volunteering--we get a free book as our \"payment.\" And I set the book aside with the intention of reading it on Christmas.Well, Christmas came and went and I forgot to read the book. So I had to wait for year two. And that Christmas went perfectly. As perfectly as it can go for a single Jew, anyway. On Christmas Eve, I went to the movies and afterward entered a nearby bar which I'd never been in. The mood was so friendly inside, the lighting just right. Christmas movies and football games on the TVs. I sat at a small table, ate, drank, and read Auggie Wren's Christmas Story, which had been tucked in my jacket pocket.Reading it, I experienced the magical \"shock of recognition.\" This story was recreated in the great movie Smoke! A cigar store, a robbery, a blind old woman on Christmas. And as the movie ends, we hear the beautiful Tom Waits song, \"Innocent When You Dream.\" It's just about perfect, and reading this book was like visiting with a dear old friend.While I sat in the bar, I got a text message out of the blue from, well, a dear old friend. Asking if I had New Year's plans. I didn't... and now I did. It was a Christmas Eve for the ages.I reviewed the book on some rival online site, and was pleased that I had a new holiday tradition. I like traditions.Except, year three, I had concert tickets on Christmas Eve. So, no movie, no bar, no Auggie.Which brings us to this year. I was worried; the bar and movie theater had both been badly damaged by Superstorm Sandy. The bar had finally reopened but we were still waiting for the theater. But on December 21, the theater did at last reopen. As it got dark, I walked up there, book again in pocket. A string of Christmas lights was on at the bar, across the way. Everything was set.As I walked out of the theater, a light snow was falling. This couldn't be more perfect. Except... now the lights were off at the bar. Where do I go now? And this snow is kind of annoying. I'll need a hat or an umbrella or something if I'm going to be walking farther. I dropped into the Rite Aid and rooted through the umbrella rack. No, no, too expensive, I have three umbrellas at home, half a mile away. No, I'm just going to get wet.I headed to the town's main drag. An awful lot of places are closed on Christmas Eve. After several blocks, I found a spot where I'd had some happy times with friends in years gone by. They were open, and the kitchen was open, and that was good enough for me. No Guinness on tap; I was having a holiday craving for a Guinness. Oh well, I'll manage.The mood was... acceptable. Not perfect, but perfection is hard to recreate. I sat at the bar, ate, drank, and read Auggie Wren's Christmas Story. And it was brilliant all over again. It's short, real short, but the illustrations make you slow down and let it all sink in. It's like a picture book for grown ups. And the light was pretty dim so i couldn't make out all the details in the illustrations. But that seemed to fit this story of an old blind woman and the gentle lies we tell each other and tell ourselves to get from one day to another.I didn't get any New Year's text messages while I read the book, but nobody expects lightning to strike twice. It was OK. The food was real good, the beer was flowing, and I was so happy to spend a little more time with Auggie Wren. I imagine I'll see him next year too."]], "review_count": "110", "description": "<b>A timeless, utterly charming Christmas fable, beautifully illustrated and destined to become a classic.</b><br /><br /> When Paul Auster was asked by <i>The New York Times</i> to write a Christmas story for the Op-Ed page, the result, \"Auggie Wren's Christmas Story,\" led to Auster's collaboration on a film adaptation, <i>Smoke</i>. Now the story has found yet another life in this enchanting illustrated edition.<br /><br />It begins with a writer's dilemma: he's been asked by <i>The New York Times</i> to write a story that will appear in the paper on Christmas morning. The writer agrees, but he has a problem: How to write an unsentimental Christmas story? He unburdens himself to his friend at his local cigar shop, a colorful character named Auggie Wren. \"A Christmas story? Is that all?\" Auggie counters. \"If you buy me lunch, my friend, I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. And I guarantee every word of it is true.\"<br /><br />And an unconventional story it is, involving a lost wallet, a blind woman, and a Christmas dinner. Everything gets turned upside down. What's stealing? What's giving? What's a lie? What's the truth? It's vintage Auster, and pure pleasure: a truly unsentimental but completely affecting tale.<br />", "author": "Paul Auster"}, "New York Trilogy   Whodunit?": {"average_rating": "0.00", "review": [["First, a brief harangue. I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way.

When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh.

Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world.

Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again.

My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place. Fanshawe was there, and no matter how hard I tried not to think of him, I couldn't escape. This was unexpected, galling.

However, it does deserve to be read by more fans of Post-Modernism who are labouring under a misapprehension about which authors are truly worthy in that space.The novel packs more into its 438 pages than most Post-Modernist or maximalist books two or three times longer (at least those I\u2019ve read, and I\u2019ve read a few).It\u2019s also worth reading because it was influential on David Foster Wallace\u2019s \n\u201cInfinite Jest\u201d\n and, I would argue, on Joseph McElroy\u2019s \n\u201cWomen and Men\u201d\n and William H. Gass' \n\"The Tunnel\"\n (one of DeLillo's characters lives in a hole, and tunnels into a hole within the hole).14 Year Old Math WizFourteen year old (little) Billy Twillig (a euphonious contraction of Terwilliger) is the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Mathematics. He is invited to fly to \u201ca distant land\u201d, where he becomes part of a scientific team that wishes to decode and respond to a radio signal that has apparently been received from another planet (which orbits Ratner\u2019s star). The project morphs into an attempt to develop a language (Logicon) which can be used to communicate with all potential aliens.Mathematics has a central role in the novel, but it needn\u2019t intimidate readers who are not mathematically (or geometrically) inclined.If anything, the novel is just as much interested in the shortcomings of mathematics, if only in the context of the radio signal project. While we do learn the source and significance of the radio signal eventually, it\u2019s not due to mathematical reasoning, but more to spontaneous intuition.The narrative arc follows the increasing scepticism about mathematical logic. Initially, it is respected for its objectivity:\u201cThere is no reality more independent of our perception and more true to itself than mathematical reality.\u201d\u201cThere may be a lot of crazy things in the world that scare you and me but mathematics is the one thing where there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of or stupid about or think it\u2019s a big mystery.\u201dUltimately, we discover that reason and logic are not sufficient to help us unravel the mysteries of the universe:\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable that some things exist beyond the borders of rational inquiry.\u201dNames and NumbersTraditionally, our ability to understand the world depends on words and numbers, or language and counting. We can only understand what we can name (with a word) or count. You can see in this novel the origins of DeLillo\u2019s interest in \u201cnames\u201d, which he explored in his next novel, \n\u201cThe Names\u201d:\n\u201cNames tell stories and so do numbers.\u201d\u201cKnow the names of things and write them like a child in elemental lists. Who was it said names and numbers give us power over the world? Spengler no less.\u201d\"The Unsolvable Knot of Science and Mysticism\" (Fresh Dimensions)In this novel, the real narrative arc seeks to go beyond words and numbers into \u201cfresh dimensions\u201d. Like Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cThe Crying of Lot 49\u201d, the quest isn\u2019t necessarily successful. There remains a mystery that is unsolved. In the absence of a better word (or concept), what lies outside logic, mathematics and reason falls within the realm of mysticism. \u201cWe can pretend a little, can\u2019t we? We\u2019re not so scientific that we can\u2019t have a little make-believe, right. Then, if something drips through, there\u2019s a continuation, another chance, the universe refreshed.\u201d\u201cThe history of science is crosshatched with lines of additive and corrective thought. This is how we try to arrive at truth. Truth accumulates.\u201d\u201cLogic is the scrub brush the mathematician uses to keep his work free of impurity. Logic says yes or no to the forms constructed through intuition. So-called intuitive truths have to be subjected to the rigors of logic before we can take them seriously, much less use them in our work...\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is restate and strengthen our method of reasoning. Make it exact and supremely taut. Introduce distinctions and fresh relationships. Argue our propositions in terms of precise ideographic symbols. Submit our mathematics, in short, to a searching self-examination. In the process we\u2019ll discover what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false not only in the work before us but in the very structure of our reasoning... \u201cThis is a revolution in the making. All science, all language wait to be transformed by what we\u2019re doing here.\u201dTruth needs a little belief and a little doubt, in order to advance.Still, without the framework of reason, on the other side of mathematics lies the abyss:\u201cExistence would be sheer dread without the verifiable fictions of mathematics.\u201dWe need some tools to help us negotiate it. Ironically, they lie on a continuum that consists of:\u201cTheology. Logic. Mathematics. Art.\u201dHowever, are these tools enough?Elements of MadnessEven within high level science, there is a little madness and a few madmen willing to share theirs with us:\u201cThe Cheops Feeley Medal is the underground prize, given for work that has an element of madness to it. Of course, no one says this openly. But we all know that madness content is a determining factor.\u201d\u201cOnly the fiercest risks make existence possible.\u201d\u201cAlternate physics, if it teaches us anything, it teaches us that once you go across the line, once you\u2019re over the line and left without your classical resources, your rational explanations, the whole of your scientific ethos, once this happens you have to pause...You\u2019re over the line, sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to keep going or hurl yourself into the uncharted void. This is nonsense. You pause. You reflect. You get your bearings. Alternate physics, if it\u2019s to move out of the theoretical realm, as it may have to one day, I guarantee you, with a vengeance, and into areas of direct application, must give us the bearings we need, or, lacking bearings to give, must soothe and support.\u201dThe Nameless BeingThe realm of the mystical is the realm of the unknown, the unknowable, the hidden, the infinite, the spiritual, what is not there:\u201cThe en-sof is the unknowable. The hidden. The that-which-is-not-there. The neither-cause-nor-effect. The G-dash-d beyond G-dash-d. The limitless. The not-only-unutterable-but-by-definition-inconceivable. Yet it emanates. It reveals itself through its attributes, the sefiroth. G-dash-d is the first of the ten sefirothic emanations of the en-sof. Without the en-sof\u2019s withdrawal or contraction, there could be no point, no cosmic beginning, no universe, no G-dash-d.\u201dhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Sofhttp://www.newkabbalah.com/einsof.htmlhttp://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/art...EsotericaSome of this is hidden in secret writings, away from the religious or scientific mainstream (I have no knowledge or understanding of the Kabbalah):\u201cThere is always something secret to be discovered. A hidden essence. A truth beneath the truth. What is the true name of G-dash-d? How many levels of unspeakability must we penetrate before we arrive at the true name, the name of names? Once we arrive at the true name, how many pronunciations must we utter before we come to the secret, the hidden, the true pronunciation?\u201d\u201cAll this esoterica. Born in the East. Moving as if by stealth to other parts of the world. Always this obscurity. This secret element.\u201d\u201cThe mystical writings. The mystical oral traditions. The mystical interpretations, oral and written. These exist beneath the main body of thought and thinking. You don\u2019t go into a trance reading the everyday writings. The hidden texts, try them. The untranslated manuscripts. The oral word.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look down your nose at esoterica. If you know the right combination of letters, you can make anything. This is the secret power of the alphabet. Meaningless sounds, abstract symbols, they have the power of creation. This is why the various parts of the mystical writings are not in proper order. Knowing the order, you could make your own world from just reading the writings. Everything is built from the twenty-two letter elements. The alphabet itself is both male and female. Creation depends on an anagram.\u201d\u201cWhen I go into mystical states, I pass beyond the opposites of the world and experience only the union of these opposites in a radiant burst of energy. I call it a burst.\u201dPantheism vs. The KabbalahAt times DeLillo approaches a form of pantheism:\u201cThe universe is the name of G-dash-d. All of us. Everything. Here, there, everywhere.. time and space. The whole universe. It all adds up to the true name of G-dash-d.\u201dDeLillo never mentions Spinoza, but he seems to haunt the novel. Ironically (or perhaps not), the editor of some of Spinoza\u2019s works was Joseph Ratner. It would be interesting to know whether this is the source of the character\u2019s and the star\u2019s name.Nevertheless, DeLillo takes his novel on a journey from mathematics to metaphysics.Fun and GamesmanshipThere are a lot of fun and games in the novel as well.The radio signal project is stalked by a Honduran business cabal or cartel, which changes its identity to a consortium (because it sounds more credible and less corrupt), and its name to the more abbreviated ACRONYM.Its leader speaks in an amusing pigeon English:\u201cNothing trivionis about this operation...\u201cTry to forgive my wordage.\u201cWe admit to a lust for abstraction. The cartel has an undrinkable greed for the abstract. The concept-idee of money is more powerful than money itself.\u201cWe lease and sublease multi kinds of time - makeshift, standby, conceptual et al forth. Then we either buy, sell, retain or incite revolution, all totally nonprofitless, done merely to flux the [money] curve our way.\u201cThere are things past spelling and far beyond counting. No word or number reaches there. You must live inside a schnitt not to know of this. I can only say tant pis, piccolissimo. I position you neither here nor elsewhere. Oblivio obliviorum.\u201cThis is life as it is lived in the world of existenz. A nothingness full of pitfalls. Pitfallful. We\u2019re forced to conclude you extemporarily from our cartel. Nihil ex nihilo. A thing deprived of living existenz.\u201dThe Rules of the GameDeLillo plays Nabokovian games with us throughout the text, but he always does it according to strict rules:\u201cStrict rules add dignity to a game.\u201dThis novel is both playful and dignified, without being pretentious.SOUNDTRACK:Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - \"Woodstock\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrWNT...\"We are stardust, we are goldenWe are billion year old carbonAnd we got to get ourselves back to the garden...\"Luna - \"Math Wiz\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FYUmVb6...\"A twelve year old math wizCame to me in my sleepHe knew all the answersWhich he kept to himself\"The Modern Lovers - \"Dignified and Old\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKmgR...February 6, 2016"], ["Seems like Delillo took a bunch of postmodern conceits (funny names like Calliope Shrub and Elux Troxl; precocious kid; unrealistic, posturing dialogue; near-opaque symbols; metafiction) and threw them together in a broken blender. Everything works well for the first half, the elements blending together and whirling faster and faster like the book's aborigine. Then something goes horribly wrong; the top pops off, causing the blender to spew postmodernism all over the walls. And as we all know, postmodernism is notoriously difficult to clean up.So what is there to enjoy in this book? Well, it was interesting to see a direct ancestor of IJ's Hal in Billy Twillig. Not only is Billy freakishly smart, he also has the same childish wit as Hal. Two examples:\"...noting in the mirror how unlike himself* he looked, neat enough in his sport coat and tie but unusually pale and somehow tired, as though this manufactured air were threatening his very flesh, drawing out needed chemicals and replacing them with evil solvents made in New Jersey.\"\"'...lecture tours, talk shows, a quickie biography, t-shirts, funny buttons.

Tell us and we'll get him.''People from the Bronx don't have heroes.'\"And there's one other thing: people don't often say this about Delillo, but he has a tendency to (despite his habitual self-obfuscating) drop little bits of nearly-sentimental, life-affirming philosophy. I've written about this before here, but here's an example from Ratner's Star:\"Everywhere is a place. All places share this quality. Is there any real difference between going to a gorgeous mountain resort with beautiful high thin waterfalls so delicate and ribbonlike they don't even splash when they hit bottom--waterfalls that plash; is this so different from sitting in a kitchen with bumpy linoleum and grease on the wall behind the stove across the street from a gravel pit? What are we talking about? Two places, that's all. There's nowhere you can go that isn't a place. So what's such a difference? If you can understand this idea, you'll never be unhappy. Think of the word 'place.' A sun deck with views of gorgeous mountains. A tiny dark kitchen. These share the most important of all things anything can share. They are places. The word 'place' applies in both cases. In this sense, how do we distinguish between them? How do we say one is better or worse than the other? They are equal in the most absolute of ways. Grasp this truth, sonny, and you'll never be sad.\"Logically questionable, but sure makes you feel better if you happen to live in a really crappy place.*bonus dissociation/fragmentation!"], ["According to Wikipedia this is Don DeLillo's favorite of his novels. It's not mine. I think that I missed something in the book, like DeLillo was doing something that I didn't quite catch, or I caught but I wasn't that impressed by it. I'm not sure what I'm saying.This is DeLillo's first 'big' novel. I haven't read Underworld yet, but from the books of his I've read I think I like him best when his books are compact. I think it's possible (this could change as I read the rest of his works) that Point Omega might be my favorite of his works. It's short but it's tight and beautiful. Every word in the book counts, unlike in most of my reviews. The writing in Ratner's Star has the 'DeLillo' sparseness to it (usually) but the plot or the narrative is too sprawling. The narrative sort of reminded me of something that Gaddis might have tried to do (and the characters have a very Gaddis quality to them, and the way especially in the final section of the book that action and characters will shift for no discernible way made me think of the de-centering that Gaddis is such a master at in his 'big' novels), but (I hate to say this), at times many of the scenes felt like skits. As if there were some funny things DeLillo thought he could have scientists do so he made an absurd or slapstick chapter to put them in. Each chapter might have a continuing theme or message he's trying to convey but I never felt like he was successfully getting that message across. It was as if he were being too blunt about what he wanted to say but vague in the details. He wasn't leaving enough table scraps around for the reader (me) to put together the story myself, but what was being given was kind of, yeah, so? I'm having a hard time writing this. A lot of my criticisms are things I normally like in novels. It's too big, it's too sprawling, there isn't enough of a center, it's too silly at times, it's not clear enough... if anyone were to say that Infinite Jest or JR were any of these things I'd be ready to jump at the books defense and say, yeah they are but that's all part of the book, it all has to be there. But for this novel I thought that all of these things I'm normally a 'meta-fiction' nerd in loving just weren't working right. It's like this book is a really nice looking car and you want to love it but a lot of stuff in the engine is just not firing off right so you've got this nice looking car that is sputtering down the road being trailed by a noxious black cloud (an Airborne Toxic Event?) and limping along with two nice tires and two donuts. If I was told what the book was about, and how it was presented and all of that I'd be jumping up and down in joy wanting to read it, but somewhere in the execution the book failed for me. What saved the book was DeLillo's dialogue. I love the staccato overly stylized way he writes dialogue. It's very artificial, but overly stylized things have to be, right? Even though it's not flashy at all, the way his characters speak reminded me of the violence in a (good Hong Kong) John Woo movie. So totally fake, but beautiful in its construction and execution. I'm not sure why I kept thinking about John Woo movies while reading this book but I think the analogy holds at least a little bit.Two DFW related notes. I'm convinced that DFW is paying homage to DeLillo in Infinite Jest. Out of the early novels of his I've read so far, this one has the least explicit things that DFW returns to in Infinite Jest, but there is a fictional event called The MIT Language Riots that appear in both works, and the recurring question of \"Explain please\" I think is used quite often by a character in a DFW work, but I can't remember if it was in Infinite Jest or another work, or obviously what character uses this."], ["My reactions to this novel can be put rather succinctly. If David Foster Wallace is indeed a fan of Don Delillo, this is the novel he has stolen from most. If Don Delillo is indeed a fan of Thomas Pynchon, this is the novel that Pynchon most directly inspired. But regardless of its influences or the work it later inspired, because those things are speculatory, it is certainly true that this novel, Delillo's fourth, is his first great novel. The novel centers around child math prodigy Billy Terwilliger. At fourteen years old, Billy has already won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with \"zorgs\" (as near as I can figure, Delillo made this term up) and now lives a life of quiet seclusion at a mathematics academy for genius teenagers. He is called, somewhat against his will, to a remote laboratory (named Field Experiment Number One) to decipher a string of code believed to have come from a newly discovered planet coined Ratner's Star. This is a wildly funny novel with sequences of surrealistic absurdity and populated with bizarre characters. There's Henrik Endor, who, before Billy, failed to break the code and now lives in a hole, spending his days digging and feeding on larvae. There's Orang Mohole, the acknowledged kingpin of alternate physics, who subsists on strange green pills and vicarious threesomes. There's Shazar Lazarus Ratner, a renowned astronomer turned mystic so diseased that he now lives in a plastic bubble so that oxygen cannot kill him. There's Elux Troxl, the entrepeneur, who, alongside his oddly-perverted sidekick Grbk, deals in leased computer time, chain letters, and bat guano. There's Cheops Feeley, who annually awards a prize to the mathematician whose new ideas holds the highest \"madness content.\" There's also Chester Greylag Dent, ninety-two-years old and ending his days in a secret submarine somewhere off the shore of Europe.It's hard saying what purpose this novel is intended to serve, what point Delillo is trying to make. But it seems obvious that there is something to be said here about the stupidity of science, the differences between thinking analytically, thinking logically, and thinking superstitiously. And, despite its humor, there is an overwhelming sense of attempting to understand the complex emotional distance and sadness people feel when they truly are more brilliant than the people around them.This is as close to a five star novel as I have read in a while. Distinctly Delillo, it shows definite strides in the direction of becoming the novelist he will eventually become."], ["DeLillo has always been more of a novelist of ideas more than the basic linear event-event-event-conclusion linear plot style.Here he experiments with mathematics, logic, and the meanings of language, and language as a means to shape the world. This is no bullshit and repetition of terminology - he's obviously done his homework - I see discussions of Higgs theory, the origins of language, and the intersection between the pursuit of science and the almost mystical devotions of mathematics/language. This is dense reading, but DeLillo's fantastic prose style still illuminates.As an aside, I wonder how many contemporary authors have some sort of training in math/science? DFW did work on modal logic and Wittgenstein, and Cormac McCarthy edits physics books in his spare time at the Santa Fe institute."], ["My favorite Delillo so far, by a wide margin, inclusive of Underworld.First Nobel in mathematics goes to teenage protagonist, whose work was \u201cunderstood by only three or four people\u201d (4), which work kid has designated as \u201czorgs\u201d (20): \u201cit\u2019s pretty impossible to understand unless you know the language. A zorg is a kind of number. You can\u2019t use zorgs for anything except in mathematics. Zorgs are useless. In other words they don\u2019t apply\u201d (id.). These statements are of course manifestly dishonest, as kid was really saying on the inside (i.e., the same manner in which I launch dreadful broadsides contra any of my wives when their respective wraths may have been upon them), that \u201cbeauty was mere scenery unless it was severe, adhering strictly to a set of consistent inner codes, and this he clearly perceived, the arch-reality of pure mathematics, its austere disposition, its links to simplicity and permanence\u201d (13) (emphases added). We should expect therefore that the aesthetic principles of this novel are laid out strictly as a consistent inner code, insofar as the text discloses rules for its own construction. It is of course pleasant when one\u2019s expectations come to fruition, such as in one character\u2019s description of her own writing, which is appropriately self-referential: \u201cit\u2019s an experimental novel, an allegory, a lunar geography, an artful autobiography, a cryptic scientific tract, a work of science fiction\u201d (57). We know that \u201cstrict rules add dignity to a game\u201d (334). I plan to make strict rules that I plan to follow. Reading my book will be a game with specific rules that have to be learned. I\u2019m free to make whatever rules I want as long as there\u2019s an inner firmness and cohesion, right? Just like mathematics.\u201d (352) Certain \u2018notes\u2019 on the final third\u2019s \u2018Logicon\u2019 project might serve as hermeneutic rules here (cf. 330-332, 365-66, 383, 391-92); a clever reading might work through those, as well as any mandatory grammars or peremptory language otherwise deployed in the text\u2014I\u2019m not doing it because that\u2019s work and this is pro bono. Regardless, \u201cThis is where zorgs fit in, the technicality, the precision, the mathematics, the language. Strict rules\u201d (359).Text proceeds as kid\u2019s somewhat picaresque journey through several special projects related (vel non) to an alleged alien broadcast. He meets many other science types, all memorable, witty confrontations. A few of these characters recur, but many of them are pynchonian one-offs. There are nevertheless some basic principles that recur with regularity, and might be the rules of the text.For instance, protagonist\u2019s \u201ckind of mathematics are undertaken solely to advance the art. In time to come, of course, what had been pure might finally be applied\u201d (33). The most important rule, then: \u201cThere is no reality more independent of our perception and more true to itself than mathematical reality\u201d (48). Mathematics has no content. Form, it\u2019s nothing but form. It stands on thin air. The symbols we use are everything. What they represent we discard without the slightest misgiving. The focus of our thought, the object of our examination, our analysis, our passion if you will, is the notation itself. (286) The next recognizable rule is \u201cthe terror of the irrational\u201d (22), specifically that \u201cno definition of science is complete without a reference to terror\u201d (36). We then see \u2018terror\u2019 (lovecraftian terror, rather than osamaniac) reiterate often: \u201cOf course if evidence of universal blueshifting is ever found, it will merit the smallest note. This is documentary void. Not void whose essence is terror. Not the human sensorium streaked with darkness\u201d (50); \u201cThere may be a lot of crazy things in the world that scare you and me but mathematics is the one thing where there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of or stupid about or think it\u2019s a big mystery\u201d (67); \u201cTerror is everywhere. [\u2026] Take demons, for example. You wouldn\u2019t think there\u2019s a connection between demons and the sperm in your testicles. The terror of onanism is that bodiless demons are able to make bodies for themselves from the spilled seed\u201d (227); \u201cBut math struck terror\u201d (234); Protagonist hasn\u2019t \u201chad time to drift away from your psychic origins, whatever these may have been, however replete with terror, darkness and fetal shrieks. Routine horripilation\u201d (265).The terror of the irrational that is inherent to the definition of science leads quite plainly into the second rule of the text: \u201cBy common consent the star code is no longer an ongoing project. I\u2019m amazed anyone took it seriously in the first place. Radio signals weren\u2019t even repeated. A jumble of pulses\u201d (264) (emphasis added). That is to say, the rules of the text are no longer an ongoing project, a baudrillardian dissimulation that disavows rules even while following them. Consider the following constantly changing reports of the scientist administrators regarding the text\u2019s underlying mystery, the receipt of an apparent transmission from the eponymous celestial object:1: \u201cWe\u2019ve been contacted by someone or something in outer space\u201d (46);2: \u201cThe star is a common G dwarf. It\u2019s called Ratner\u2019s Star. It lies away from us a bit toward the galactic center. We\u2019ve analyzed the variation or wiggle in its path and we believe the object in question is a low-mass planet that occupies the star\u2019s habitable zone\u201d (50);3: \u201cIs Ratner\u2019s star an illusion? Of course not. It\u2019s out there and everyone knows it. Is the planet\u2019s existence a hoax? Ridiculous. There\u2019s clear evidence of a planet in orbit around the star. Is someone transmitting signals? Absolutely. Is our synthesis telescope receiving on the secret frequency? Nods of affirmation\u201d (63);4: \u201cThe star is part of a two-star system\u201d (93);5: \u201cRatner\u2019s star is a main sequence star and its sister star is a black hole\u201d (101);6: \u201cRatner\u2019s star is on the verge of becoming a red giant [\u2026] increase in luminosity. Startling increase in radius\u201d (140);7: \u201cSpace Brain has now confirmed a two-satellite configuration\u201d (151);8: \u201cthe computer retrovert we\u2019ve just run indicates error in the receiving equipment\u201d (240);9: \u201cI\u2019d like everyone to stop using expressions like \u2018Ratnerians,\u2019 \u2018superbeings,\u2019 \u2018extraterrestrials\u2019 and so forth. It\u2019s a radio source we\u2019re in touch with. If Moholean relativity is the real thing, the source isn\u2019t even where it seems to be. So why assume it\u2019s a planet orbiting a star? Remember the homely adage: \u2018Belief in the causal nexus is superstition.\u2019 So let\u2019s from now on be sure to use the term \u2018artificial radio source.\u2019 And let\u2019s find a more precise name for the so-called beings who are presumed to have initiated the transmission. How about \u2018artificial radio source extants\u2019? ARS extants\u201d (274);10: \u201cBecause Ratner\u2019s star lies within a suspected Mohole, which is a fractional part, as I understand it, of the value-dark dimension, meaning no spatial area and no time, it was thought the signal picked up by the synthesis telescope was originating from Ratner\u2019s star. But it wasn\u2019t [\u2026] It was just that the Mohole had trapped the signal and sent it our way. Ratner\u2019s star is a binary dwarf. Couldn\u2019t possibly sustain a planet of any size\u201d (357);11: \u201cUsing information gathered by satellite, balloon-borne instruments, and, most of all, by a device of recent concoction called an echolocation quantifier, we believe we have traced the radio signals to their source [\u2026] The source of the message is the planet Earth [\u2026] The signals originated somewhere in this planet. Were absorbed in some component of the Mohole totality. Were eventually reflected back this way\u201d (402);12: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve apparently discovered is that we are in the Mohole, if that\u2019s the way to phrase it. This solar system appears to be what we call Mohole-intense. We are part of the value-dark dimension\u201d (410). I\u2019m sufficiently Hegelian to recognize this process as a dialectical reversal of some sort or another; either \u201cthe solidarity of opposites is completely shattered\u201d thereby, reduced to \u201cessential dichotomies\u201d (34), or it\u2019s just a pedestrian \u201creconciliation of opposites\u201d (313). (As M&E otherwise lay out in the Manifesto, class struggle shall result either in the \u2018revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\u2019)It may well be swiftian satire of science, though of course Swift was misanthropically rightwing, whereas Delillo strikes me as nothing if not a strident exemplar of enlightenment. (One may be forgiven if one is confused however by such bits as \u201cHe was part of a committee formed to define the word \u2018science\u2019 [\u2026] the debate continued to drag on and the definition at present ran some five hundred pages\u201d (30).) Text presents plenty of bogus theory at the research compound: \u2018slyphing\u2019 (49 et seq.); \u2018bi-levelism (66); challenge to phenomenal basis of empiricism (87); a \u201clust for abstraction\u201d that leads inexorably and completely reasonably to the grafting of a brain on a computer (146, 244); and then moholes (179 ff.), which are the undisputed champion of douchitude in the text.Anyway, most of these clowns win Nobel prizes (306). As the text is pleased to reiterate, \u201ckeep believing it, shit for brains\u201d (27, 57, 167, 258). (KBISFB is likely a rule of the text, of course.)There likely a rule in the recurrent discrete/continuous binary (95, 245, 348, 389), but am not sure about it beyond the punchline: \u201cThe discrete-continuous quality of zorgs is what really helped us work out the necessary mathematics of Moholean relativity and made Mohole identification practically inevitable\u201d (418).A further rule: We are assured that there\u2019s \u201csomething about waste material that defied systematic naming\u201d (38), which is of course the primary concern of the epistemology of the accursed share provided by Underworld. But this is also a consideration of \u201cthings beyond expression\u201d in general: the names of deities, infernal beings, totemic animals and plants; the names of an individual\u2019s blood relatives of the opposite sex (a ban related to incest restrictions); the new name given a boy at his initiation; the names of certain organs of the body; the names of the recently dead; the names of sacred objects, profane acts, leaders of cults, the cults themselves. Double substitutes must be used.\u201d (38) Looping back to the rule on terror: To bear a name is both terrible and necessary. The child, emerging from the space-filling chaos of names, comes eventually to see that escape from verbal designation is never complete, never more than a delay in meeting one\u2019s substitute, that alphabetic shadow abstracted from its physical source. (19) We might consider these comments in connection with Derrida\u2019s  On the Name (not now; that\u2019s work).Derridean concerns will provide other rules of the text, which notes a \u201cdirect correlation between writing and memory\u201d (361-62) (that\u2019s the Speech & Phenomena, yo); \u201cwriting is memory, she thought, and memory is the fictional self\u201d (362). We are presented with \u201cthe very uselessness of Logicon\u201d project (409), which seeks to develop an ideal language to correspond with the ARS extants, who of course, supra, turn out to be Earthlings. The uselessness (\u2018it does not apply,\u2019 recall) is considered a virtue by those who do \u2018pure work\u2019: \u201cI do pure work. A lot of it is so abstract it can\u2019t be put on paper or even talked about. I deal with proof and nonproof\u201d (46), which is both uselessly virtuous but also another \u201cthing beyond expression,\u201d an excess exorbitant to language. \u201cThere are things past spelling and far beyond counting\u201d (147). Other interesting bits in this connection: a guy\u2019s voice is a \u201cproto-laryngeal reconstruction of the sound of a lost language\u201d (147-48); another guy believes in \u201cthe secret power of the alphabet, the unnameable name, the literal contraction of the superdivinity, fear of sperm demons\u201d (215) (KBISFB?). Something about the Heideggerian polemos (217), the \u201cbeginning of distinctions.\u201d Elsewise, a \u201cthing beyond naming\u201d (226). One guy eats post-circumcision foreskin (105); another guy eats post-natal placenta (140). As our teen protagonist notes, \u201cI make no reply\u201d (9, 155). We make a brief listing of other potential miscellaneous rules of the text: a typology of ignorance (157); \u201ctruth accumulates. It can be borrowed and paid back\u201d (193); \u201cThe whole history of mathematics is subterranean, taking place beneath history itself\u201d (195); \u201cworship of the body always ends in fascism\u201d (361); \u201clatent in any period\u2019s estimation of itself as an age of reason is the specific history of the insane\u201d (387) (cf. Foucault!).Not rules, but kinda cool: teen protagonist\u2019s mentor is a brilliant, extremely sexually active person afflicted by dwarfism, and is described as an \u201cidealized Hollywood dwarf\u201d (312). Perhaps a source for Tyrion Lannister?Teen protagonist is the inventor of the \u201cstellated twilligon\u201d (116-17), a quadrilateral of some alleged import in the setting, and which shows up repeatedly throughout. Kid receives fill-in-blank quiz questions in the mails (294 ff.) from one of the other Nobel prize winners: \u201cIn a tricky situation it is your best friend, above all others, who would find it easiest to ___________ you. ___Deceive ___Believe.\u201d So, am wondering: After reading Ratner\u2019s Star, the fictive quadrilateral is best described as a _________________? ___stellated twilligon __fellated dellilogon?(view spoiler)[By the end, kid deciphers the signal, which communicates a specific time, which time marks the end of the world. That end is appropriately named a \u201cnoncognate celestial anomaly\u201d (420, 434) by some characters, which is the most kickass name for the end of the world that I\u2019ve seen. Teen protagonist by contrast refers to it simply as \u201czorgasm\u201d (438). That is also kickass. (hide spoiler)]Recommended for readers who touch themselves in the male or female region, persons who wonder how we can learn from the past unless we repeat it, and those who slowly have begun to understand the higher reality of nonobjective truth."], ["Ratner\u2019s Star is a profound(ly funny) work of metaphysical fiction. It is metaphysical in both the Ancient (Pythagorean/Parmenidean)sense, and the Modern (Dialectic of Enlightenment) sense. It is an enormously ambitious novel that presents and resides in the age-old tension between reason and faith, truth and superstition, science and art, pure math and formal logic, mind and body, being and becoming, everything and nothing. Abstractly speaking--as the precocious young mathematician that serves as our protagonist would prefer--this all points to both the necessity and the problem of the One and the Zero; oppositional binaries that purportedly cannot be resolved without the destruction of the other. And yet here we are, constructing technology that runs on binary code, incorporating the opposition in every aspect of our lives. If we are to believe Horkheimer and Adorno, the history of the human species is just this: the dialectical process of scientific disenchantment and mythical re-enchantment, perpetuating itself ad infinitum. If I had to guess, I\u2019d suspect DeLillo agrees with their conclusion.The history of Pythagoreanism provides a helpful topology for understanding the tension or \u201cdilemma\u201d of the novel. Iamblichus (3-4th C.) tells us in On the Pythagorean Way of Life that followers of the mathematical-genius-cum-mystical-sage split in two after his death in the late 4th C. BCE. One discipleship, the mathematikoi professed to deal only with Truth. They pursued Pythagoras\u2019 mathematical insights, and sought to expand his work on ratios and the table of opposites. The other group, the akousmatikoi (literally \u201cthe ones eager to hear\u201d--the root of our word acoustic and all it implies), were not recognized by the mathematikoi as genuine Pythagoreans. The akousmatikoi were circumspectly treated as a superstitious, mystical and undisciplined cult. This split, in a very fundamental sense, marks the beginning of the dialectic of Enlightenment: it is the beginning of the rejection of mysticism or myth in favor of scientific-mathematical truth.But it is worth noting that Pythagoras himself fell on neither side of this divide, but believed that both myth (read: spirituality) and mathematics informed and depended upon one another. Pythagoras understood that human life--how we live and how we should live--is not decipherable nor discoverable via pure mathematics. Perhaps, on Adorno and Horkheimer\u2019s reading, Pythagoras was the last real Mensch: he daringly lived well in the opposition before the opposition, and for that reason is rightly venerated. I\u2019d suggest DeLillo, or at least the younger DeLillo that wrote Ratner\u2019s Star, was fully aware of Pythagoras\u2019s mensch-ness, and wrote a (literary/untrue) novel about (mathematics/truth) to explore the tension and how to resolve it."], ["This comes off to me as someone self-consciously trying to write a postmodern novel and not quite succeeding. There are big swaths of Gaddis, Pynchon, and Heller and little hints of Gass and Barth throughout this novel, but those authors did a far better job of combining the intellectual concerns Ratner's Star takes on with interesting stories. When Gravity's Rainbow (still a terrific novel, mind) has more narrative coherence than what you're doing, you're sort of in trouble.Ratner's Star is a novel with issues. DeLillo's characters are paper-thin, often demarcated by goofy gimmicks. \"This guy dug himself into a hole! This guy shows people his nipples!\" Contrast this against the still odd, still stilted, but also unforgettable characters of later novels, Murray in White Noise and DeLillo's interpretation of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra, and you can tell that the guy still had a long way to go before he hit his later greatness in this early stage in the game. They don't really develop, either. Furthermore, while the novel tries to tell the fascinating story of decoding transmissions from far-off Ratner's Star, this terrific premise is unfortunately dropped off the nearest convenient cliff for long stretches at a time, only to be awkwardly shoehorned in later.What saves this one's bacon, besides the fact that DeLillo is always funny, are the big long intellectual monologues, which are clumsily delivered and as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face but which are about topics that interest me. I've gained a certain amount of patience for interruptive discourse as long as it's about a topic I personally am into, and for as badly as this book wanders off-course (and it's not like I mind digressive books, I just don't find these particular digressions delivered as well as Gravity's Rainbow's digressions), it's fascinating to read so much about language, astronomy and mythology. In the end, though, I only found Ratner's Star engaging in fits and starts. That third star is on account of a good concept and some cool content, as well as how much fun I had digging around for bits that reminded me of Infinite Jest: Billy Twillig is a less-developed Hal Incandenza, and there are those MIT language riots. I know DFW loved this book and understand why to a degree, but this is not the DeLillo of the '80s and '90s, that's for sure."], ["Chiariamo subito che il libro si \u00e8 preso una stella sola e che l'altra \u00e8 per me, che sono riuscita a finirlo.

Shame. All his gifts and his mysteries are on display here, wrapped up in one of his most enjoyable, inexplicable, and lushly all-enveloping plots. Rereading it now, I\u2019m more convinced than ever that it\u2019s terribly underrated.The essential storyline, if there is one, concerns the quest of fourteen-year-old Prairie to find her long-lost mother Frenesi, a hippy-chick revolutionary turned government informer, who has left a string of lovesick boys and girls wherever she\u2019s been. But around this kernel Pynchon deposits layer upon layer of sub-plots, super-plots, side-plots and inter-plots until you are wading thigh-deep through new characters, new locations, new sensations, on every page.It reads chaotically, but the chaos is intricately plotted. Pynchon is doing twenty things at once in this book, and all of them brilliantly. Prairie\u2019s story is set in the 1980s, but the key events in Frenesi\u2019s life happened fifteen or twenty years before that \u2013 and what Vineland is really about is what happened to that generation. How the counterculture kids of the 1960s turned into the Reagan voters of the 1980s. In that sense it\u2019s a political novel.OK, a political novel, all right \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t really explain the experience of this book, does it? Because along the way we have a psychic detective investigating a Godzilla attack, we have a UFO abduction during a passenger flight to Hawaii, we have a community of kunoichi, or female ninjas, in the Californian hills, a political prison deep in a nuclear fallout shelter, a Tokyo sex auction, a community of zombie-ghosts, and a potted history of mallrats. Often these incidents are slipped in obliquely, so that you put the book down blinking, as though coming up from hypnosis, thinking vaguely \u2013\u00a0did I really read that\u2026? Did I get that impression from the words on the page, or was I imagining something on my own initiative? Pynchon is a master at palming ideas off unseen, adding more and more dependent clauses to his sentences, pushing the key information further and further down, so that it seeps in through a kind of osmosis and, though you understand what he\u2019s talking about, you don\u2019t quite recall being told.This sense of fluidity is abetted by his extraordinary ability to slip-'n'-slide time and place when you least expect it, jumping in and out of different timezones without the usual formalities but without, also, any jarringly \u2018experimental\u2019 effects. Have a look at what happens during this conversation sometime in the 1970s, where Prairie\u2019s dad Zoyd is talking to a friend about finding somewhere to stay near Frenesi\u2019s family:\u201cOn the one hand, you don\u2019t want this turning into your mother-in-law\u2019s trip, on the other hand, they might know about someplace to crash, if so don\u2019t forget your old pal, a garage, a woodshed, a outhouse, don\u2019t matter, \u2019s just me and Chloe.\u201d\u201cChloe your dog? Oh yeah, you brought her up?\u201d\u201cThink she\u2019s pregnant. Don\u2019t know if it happened here or down south.\u201d But they all turned out to look like their mother, and each then went on to begin a dynasty in Vineland, from among one of whose litters, picked out for the gleam in his eye, was to come Zoyd and Prairie\u2019s dog, Desmond. By that time Zoyd had found a piece of land with a drilled well up off Vegetable Road, bought a trailer from a couple headed back to L.A., and was starting to put together a full day\u2019s work\u2026Whoa, whoa, whoa, did you catch that? We just panned down to the dog for half a sentence, and before you know it we\u2019ve followed two generations of puppies all the way through a quick ten years, so that Pynchon can now sleight-of-hand straight into a conversation in the '80s without having to do any ponderous throat-clearing of the \u2018Several years later\u2026\u2019 variety. He pulls this shit on every page and he is GOOD at it. Most of them you won\u2019t even notice.Pynchon\u2019s women, as always, are cool and concupiscent, but the horniness is balanced here \u2013\u00a0uniquely in his oeuvre \u2013 by having a wry female protagonist who is never sexualised. Prairie is unflappable, observant, the writing never patronises her \u2013\u00a0she\u2019s one of the great teenage girls in fiction.Frenesi, by contrast, is the archetypal Pynchonic femme fatale, replaying the author\u2019s usual paranoid sexual fantasy of how nice girls just can\u2019t resist the manly charms of the Asshole King, who goes here by the name of Brock Vond, a federal neofascist who\u2019s eagerly prosecuting the Republicans\u2019 War on Drugs. A lot of people who discuss Vineland find Frenesi\u2019s motivation implausible \u2013 would she really throw everything away, her politics, her principles, her daughter, just because she can\u2019t stop fucking this guy? And is Pynchon really going to hinge his entire Heath Robinson plot on such a flimsy velleity?Yeah, he is, and the book doesn\u2019t get enough credit for playing such a calculated move. \u2018I\u2019m not some pure creature,\u2019 Frenesi agonises at one point, during a painful imagined break-up with a girlfriend who put her on the usual pedestal \u2013\u00a0\u2018you know what happens when my pussy\u2019s runnin' the show\u2026\u2019 It\u2019s a dynamic played out in almost all his books, but the collateral resonances are nowhere made more obvious, the D/S overtones in her submission to Brock prefiguring something essential about what happened to her whole generation:Brock Vond\u2019s genius was to have seen in the activities of the sixties left not threats to order but unacknowledged desires for it.There\u2019s the whole novel in a sentence. Does Pynchon believe it? Say rather that it\u2019s his secret fear. That\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary for it to play out on the interpersonal level too, which pretty soon, given his characters, comes round to some kind of Sylvia Plathlike every-woman-adores-a-fascist deal.Vineland is infused with a genuine, unfashionable nostalgia for the acid dreams of the Sixties, but a nostalgia tempered by the resolve to assess the roots of its failures as time went by and \u2018revolution went blending into commerce\u2019. Against these incursions all he can offer are the tried and tested defences of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.Mucho went to the stereo and put on The Best of Sam Cooke, volumes 1 and 2, and then they sat together and listened, both of them, to the sermon, one they knew and felt their hearts comforted by, though outside spread the lampless wastes, the unseen paybacks, the heartless power of the scablands garrison state the green free America of their childhoods even then was turning into.You can sink into this book and swim in it, and the pages will close up over your head. It\u2019s just beautifully made \u2013\u00a0hilarious and sexy and sad and constantly provocative. And it has more to say about what the 1980s were really about than any number of Brett Easton Ellis or Martin Amis or Jonathan Coe novels can manage. Perhaps it\u2019s not objectively his best book, but it is, for my money, his most fun."], ["So when you think of Pynchon you think of serious work, right? And trudgery and difficulty and obfuscation and pedanticism, and like this dizzying thing that just makes you feel unintellectual and slow for never being able to catch up, right? Well if that is the case, you have never read \nVineland\n. Because oh. my. god. This book is so fucking good.I'm not going to try to summarize or anything, because this book is too sprawling and reeling, and anyway that would be an afront to its amazingness. But look, it's got all the same basic building blocks as any Pynchon book\u2014a million characters exhaustively historied, unfollowable plot twists, crazy ranting paranoia, incredibly phraseology, bizarre songs, sixties culture, sex and violence (in fact, large swaths are oddly comparable to Kill Bill, if you ask me)\u2014but it's done at a much...easier level somehow. It's much more accessible, it's hilarious and warm, and you don't feel like you're in quicksand the whole time, just desperately trying to understand and keep breathing. See, people never talk about the really unimaginable joy that soars through Pynchon's work. And beauty! I mean look, this book is tough, for sure, and I won't try to claim that I understood everything, but honestly it just doesn't matter. It's just so much fun to read. It's not work at all. And the ending! Once I had like thirty pages left I started getting that dark foreboding feeling, you know, like there's no way he can end this satisfactorily, there just isn't enough space. I was so sure he was going to do something horrible, leaving everything messy and unfulfilling, end things like right in the middle of a sentence or something, but no! The ending was beautiful, just like the rest of the book, totally satisfying and wonderful. Jeez I loved this book. Wow."], ["This is without a doubt one of the most insane books ever written, even by Pynchon's standards this is something else, the characters are bonkers, the story if you could call it that is nuts!, not a lot makes sense, the writing feels schizophrenic, there are moments that could have come from things such as, James Bond, Tarantino, Asian ninja flicks, cartoons, the hippie movement, 80's action B-movies, spirituality and a whole lot more. The one thing that's in it's favour is the fact it was just so much fun to read!, you are riding the crest of one crazy wave, best to just go with the flow and let Pynchon's unique vision take hold."], ["If Three Should Be FiveI first read \u201cVineland\u201d some time in the 90\u2019s. Based on an imperfect recollection of it, I rated it three stars when I joined GoodReads. I\u2019ve raised my rating to five stars, partly because of how much fun I had reading it a second time.I can\u2019t think of a better novel to read between now and when we emerge safely into the Post-Trump era. Reprise and Foreshadow\u201cVineland\u201d reprises the longing and quest for an absent woman that was at the heart of \n\u201cV\u201d\n (in this case, the daughter of left-wing activist parents, a \u201cthird generation lefty\u201d, student radical, film-maker and the novel\u2019s heroine, Frenesi Gates); it features Kommandant Karl Bopp, former Nazi Luftwaffe officer and subsequently useful American citizen (who could have emigrated from \n\u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d);\n while it foreshadows the focus on the underground and anarchism that was so fundamental to \n\u201cAgainst the Day\u201d.\n More realist than Pynchon\u2019s previous three novels, its description of the American landscape is as detailed and expressive, usually as humorous and sometimes as sentimental as it would later be in \n\u201cMason & Dixon\u201d:\n\u201cThe shape of the brief but legendary Trasero County coast, where the waves were so high you could lie on the beach and watch the sun through them, repeated on its own scale the greater curve between San Diego and Terminal Island, including a military reservation which, like Camp Pendleton in the world at large, extended from the ocean up into a desert hinterland\u2026\u201d\"They were in a penthouse suite high over Amarillo, up in the eternal wind, with the sun just set into otherworld transparencies of yellow and ultraviolet, and other neon-sign colours coming on across the boundless twilit high plain\u2026(381)\"\u201cA lightning storm had appeared far out at sea and now, behind them out the window, was advancing on the city, taking brightly crazed shots all along the horizon. Somewhere in here a stereo began to play a stack of albums from the fifties, all in that sweet intense mainstream wherein the tenor drowns of love, or, as it is known elsewhere, male adolescence.\u201d\u201cZoyd, who was driving, came at last upon a long forest-lined grade and cresting saw the trees fold away, as there below, swung dizzily into view, came Vineland, all the geometry of the bay neutrally filtered under pre-storm clouds, the crystalline openwork arcs of pale bridges, a tall power plant stack whose plume blew straight north, meaning rain on the way, a jet in the sky ascending from Vineland International south of town, the Corps of Engineers marina, with salmon boats, power cruisers, and day sailers all docked together, and spilling uphill from the shoreline a couple of square miles crowded with wood Victorian houses, Quonset sheds, postwar prefab ranch and split-level units, little trailer parks, lumber-baron floridity, New Deal earnestness. And the federal building, jaggedly faceted, obsidian black, standing apart, inside a vast parking lot whose fences were topped with concertina wire. \u2018Don\u2019t know, it just landed one night, sitting there in the morning when everybody woke up, folks seem to be gettin\u2019 used to it.\u2019 (317)\u201dThis sounds like somewhere that is really there and that you\u2019re in the passenger\u2019s seat of the car that Zoyd is driving and you can see it, too. Whilst laughing.Reaganomic Drug HysteriaPublished in 1990, the novel is set partly in 1969 (in cinematic flashback), but primarily in 1984, the year in which Ronald Reagan won a second term as President. It was also a time when Reagan\u2019s economic policies (dubbed \u201cReaganomics\u201d) and his \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d (which initiates what Pynchon calls \u201cnational drug hysteria\u201d) were in full flight. Perhaps presciently for Trump, it\u2019s worth noting that the assassination attempt on Reagan was made just 69 days into his first term in 1981. People must have known what they were going to get.Ironically (or maybe not), the ultimate source of the drugs was the CIA:\u201cVerily I say that wheresoever the CIA putteth its meathooks upon the world, there also are to be found those substances which God may have created but the US Code hath decided to control. Get me?...Notice how cheap coke has been since \u201881?\u201dLeaning Across the Counter-cultureIt\u2019s well known that Pynchon has always had counter-cultural sympathies. Here, they\u2019re front and centre, as is the associated politics. Frenesi conceives of her life working in the seventies underground documentary film industry this way:\u201cWhen the sixties were over, when the hemlines came down and the colours of the clothes went murky and everybody wore makeup that was supposed to look like you had no makeup on, when tatters and patches had had their day and the outlines of the Nixonian Repression were clear enough even for the most gaga of hippie optimists to see, it was then, facing into the deep autumnal wind of what was coming, that she thought, Here, finally - here\u2019s my Woodstock, my golden age of rock and roll, my acid adventures, my Revolution. Come into my own at last...Here was a world of simplicity and certainty no acidhead, no revolutionary anarchist would ever find, a world based on the one and zero of life and death. Minimal, beautiful. The patterns of lives and deaths\u2026\u201dStudent Film CollectiveFrenesi belongs to a student film collective called 24fps, whose motto is:\u201cA camera is a gun. An image taken is a death performed. Images put together are the substructure of an afterlife and a Judgment. We will be architects of a just Hell for the fascist pig. Death to everything that oinks!\u201dI Love a Man in UniformParadoxically, Frenesi has inherited a \u201cuniform fetish\u201d from her mother, \u201cas if some Cosmic Fascist had spliced in a DNA sequence requiring this form of seduction and initiation into the dark joys of social control.\u201d She enjoys a privileged personal and financial position, because after the death of agent Weed Atman at the College of the Surf protest, she\u2019d been compromised by FBI agent, Brock Vond (\u201ca rebel cop, with his own deeply personal agenda, only following the orders of a repressive regime based on death\u201d) into supplying information and film footage about other activists for a fee (in his eyes, she had good \u201csnitch potential\u201d):\u201cHe figures he won his war against the lefties, now he sees his future in the war against drugs.\u201d\u201cDuly sworn officers of the law, wearing uniforms, packing guns, bound to uphold the Constitution, you think men like that would lie?\u201dFrom New Deal to No DealHowever, come Reagan\u2019s autumnal wind, things started to change:\u201cShe understood that the Reaganomic axe blades were swinging everywhere, that she and Flash [her husband] were no longer exempt, might easily be abandoned already to the upper world and any unfinished business in it that might now resume...as if they'd been kept safe in some time-free zone all these years but now, at the unreadable whim of something in power, must reenter the clockwork of cause and effect. Someplace there would be a real axe, or something just as painful, Jasonic, blade-to-meat final - but at the distance she, Flash, and Justin [their son] had by now been brought to, it would all be done with keys on alphanumeric keyboards that stood for weightless, invisible chains of electronic presence or absence...We are digits in God\u2019s computer\u2026\u201dThey go from \u201conce carefree dopers\u201d to drug criminals sought out by paramilitary law-enforcement agencies like the crop-destroying Campaign Against Marijuana Production (CAMP), Brock Vond\u2019s Political Re-Education Program (PREP) and the Ultra High-Speed Urban Reconnaissance Unit (UHURU)(one of many \u201cStar Trek\u201d references). Pynchon paints a picture of the Reagan government as a brutal, conniving fascist regime that repealed the New Deal and replaced it with No Deal:\u201cIt\u2019s the whole Reagan program, isn\u2019t it - dismantle the New Deal, reverse the effects of World War II, restore fascism at home and around the world, flee into the past, can\u2019t you feel it, all the dangerous childish stupidity - \u2018I don\u2019t like the way it came out, I want it to be my way.\u2019\u201dReagan attacks the counter-cultural underground as if it were a vicious alien virus intent on destroying the American mainstream. The residents of Vineland become victims of Rex84 (an armed exercise to test the US military's ability to detain large numbers of American citizens in case of civil unrest or national emergency.) Pynchon describes it as \u201cbig and invisible...silent, undocumented, forever deniable.\u201dThe Nature of ResistanceReagan is resisted by a coalition of forces, including dopers, bikers, students, unionists, \u201cdie hard industry lefties\u201d in Hollywood, the Old Left, Wobblies, the New Left and Anarchists. Guerillas turn skywriting and billboards that proclaim \u201cDrug Free America\u201d into \u201cDrugs Free America\u201d. Only, within a few years, they\u2019re either dead or drinking Bud Light.While I suspect that Pynchon is more sympathetic to Anarchism than I am, Frenesi comes from a family tradition that is more labour-oriented than focussed on the Identity Politics of the New Left and the Anarchist movement. Her parents have experienced HUAC inquiries, Hollywood black lists and strike-breaking. Their politics is more concerned with the plight of the working class under American capitalism than it is with more social and cultural issues. For the sake of convenience, I\u2019ll call the former Hard Left Politics and the latter Soft Left Politics.While the Soft Left continued its struggle into the 80\u2019s, its effectiveness was undermined by Reagan's use of authoritarian force and the distribution of psychedelic drugs by the law enforcement agencies. Worse still, the Soft Left was placated, sedated and negated by the new drug of complacency and conformity, Television (the Tube). Pynchon seems to lament that the Soft Left became more prominent than the Hard Left. Despite his consistent identification with the counter-culture, he seems to regard its social and cultural concerns as introspective, self-obsessed and narcissistic.To the extent that the New Left focuses on the status of the individual, it\u2019s political program is individualistic in nature. In contrast, the Old Left focuses on the role of workers under Capitalism, and its political program is collectivist.Tubular BluesThe Broken CollectivityEither way, Reagan severely damaged the collective of resistance, so that Pynchon refers to it as \u201cthe broken collectivity\u201d.Blue-eyed Frenesi's reaction was to turn blue. She suffered postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter, Prairie, who joins the quest for her mother with her father, Zoyd Wheeler, and various federal agents (not just Brock Vond) who are obsessed with her. In a way, the quest to find Frenesi after she disappears ends up being a quest for the restoration of family, and arguably family order. This is Pynchon at his most sentimental or empathetic (what he calls a \"little wave of tenderness\"). However, it also suggests an additional degree of scepticism about Anarchism. This is what he has to say about Brock Vond:\u201cBrock Vond\u2019s genius was to have seen in the activities of the sixties left not threats to order but unacknowledged desires for it. While the Tube was proclaiming youth revolution against parents of all kinds and most viewers were accepting this story, Brock saw the deep - if he\u2019d allowed himself to feel it, the sometimes touching - need only to stay children forever, safe inside some extended national Family\u2026They needed some reconditioning.\u201dPerhaps, the State doesn\u2019t need to be abolished. It too might just need some reconditioning. Whether this reads too much into Pynchon\u2019s work, I still think it can be questioned whether he equates the counterculture with Anarchism. It's arguable that an alternative culture of any significance requires a social democracy (a democratic family) within which to thrive. An anarchist society would be too full of unregulated and counterproductive individualism and conflict.The Words of the Next GenerationRightly or wrongly, Prairie's boyfriend, Isaiah Two Four, blames the Tube for what went wrong:\"Whole problem \u2018th you folks\u2019 generation, nothin\u2019 personal, is you believed in your Revolution, put your lives right out there for it - but you didn\u2019t understand much about the Tube. Minute the Tube got hold of you folks that was it, that whole alternative America, el deado meato, just like th\u2019 Indians, sold it all to your real enemies, and even in 1970 dollars - it was way too cheap\u2026\"February 26, 2017"], ["\u00e8 come provare, leggendo, l\u2019effetto di una sbornia di tetris (nella vita 1 fui nel tunnel, so di cosa parlo). ci sono un mucchio di forme colorate che piovono dall\u2019alto, e istintivamente cerchi di far quadrare tutto: nuovi personaggi, riferimenti, sottoplot, collegamenti.solo che a differenza del giochetto inventato dai russi, mano a mano che procedi, a galvanizzarti non \u00e8 il meccanismo di gratificazione-da-illusione-di-controllo che gli psicologi chiamano effetto zeigarnik (e chi fosse il signor zeigarnik mi guardo bene dal chiederlo) bens\u00ec il suo opposto. cio\u00e8 la resa incondizionata all\u2019invenzione e alla pirotecnica dell\u2019autore, e al tipo di critica che le alimenta.conta godersi lo spettacolo, insomma, che pynchon infarcisce di simboli da pop culture sporcati di riflessioni da esegeta del declino americano, o viceversa. ci si lascia travolgere dal beato effetto di spaesamento lisergico, sedurre dalla prosa, coinvolgere dal riconoscimento di quel che di vero c\u2019\u00e8 dietro ogni sparata sugli ideali infrantisi nel decennio reaganiano.non so se anche pynchon alla lunga provochi un ispessimento della corteccia nei lobi frontali, e un ampliamento delle facolt\u00e0 cognitive e del pensiero razionale. il tetris sembrerebbe provato di s\u00ec. per\u00f2 so di sicuro che, come taglia corto quel fallimentare big lebowski che \u00e8 lo zoyd wheeler di questo romanzo, \u00abfinch\u00e9 \u00e8 durata, ci siamo divertiti un mondo\u00bb."], ["I don\u2019t usually finish a book and start a review in the same breath.

And because I haven\u2019t talked about GR enough, I am still a little battered from that experience (my opinion on bananas might be forever changed, too). I needed something a little less daunting first. Enter: \u201cVineland.\u201dThis book was so good. Now being able to pinpoint a Pynchonian pattern \u2013 a few: musical outbursts, sleuthing plots, oddball character names, stunning tangents that really aren\u2019t that tangential after all, a natural vocabulary only found in the most ruthless of Scrabble opponents \u2013 helped me identify what I adore most about Pynchon\u2019s prose. It\u2019s his ability to concoct some of the most overtly zany scenes in literature, to confront the reader with these in-your-face storms of hilarity for the sake of maximizing the subtle tragedies he gently lets the story consider, leaving the reader to marinate in sadness. It\u2019s an effect that would be any mixture of sloppy, condescending, formulaic or tedious if attempted by anyone else but Pynchon makes it work. The real success is that his characters who need be sympathetic are so when someone realizes that her best days are behind her or comes to the dawning realization that he\u2019s being used by an entire government or has an ugly epiphany about the mother she never knew, it is the most heartbreaking scene in the world. As for the effort involved in decoding the obscure references that are sprinkled throughout Pynchon\u2019s books as liberally as the Bacon Bits on any salad worth eating, I was deeply grateful that T. Ruggs's novel begins the same year as I did, which meant I caught waywayWAAAAY more cultural allusions this time. The narrative flows better when I\u2019m not running to a secondary source every three lines and I appreciated the opportunity to enjoy this book less haltingly, which isn't to say that I didn't need to have a few reference materials handy. There were enough hazy hippie memories to keep me on my toes, though I caught a number of those as often as I had a flutter of joyful recognition every time The Doors or Zeppelin or Pink Floyd or some other People's Republic of Rock and Roll favorite got a shout-out.I feel a reread of \"The Crying of Lot 49\" and maybe \"Inherent Vice\" in my future.

very Pychonian characters trying to work out their relationships to each other. There is even a big Hollywood style ending (probably a pastiche/parody) to the story. I found that the backdrop was less the chaos and anarchy that I appreciated in Gravity's Rainbow, Mason&Dixon and Against the Day and so I appreciated this one less than those. I would put it low in the Pychon canon but still suggest that it is worth reading for his insights into California hippyism which are often hilarious and sometimes poignant."], ["Gravity's Rainbow is the flashy intellectual you date for a few months before discovering his/her pretensions to be vaguely problematic long-term; Vineland (like Zoyd) is the partner you keep around for while, who cuddles you at night and makes fancy herbal tea. I'll stay friends with Gravity's Rainbow always, but Vineland hit me really hard and my allegiance is to the latter - as a more accessible, beautifully-written but nonetheless still-Deleuzian brain fuck of healthy proportions."], ["I had a preconceived notion of what just how good Vineland would be before I read it. My opinions about the book have been influenced by numerous accounts of how weak it was. After having read everything that preceded Pynchon's fourth novel, it's still difficult for me to wholeheartedly disagree, even though I thoroughly enjoyed some parts of it. It made me laugh...but even though I wasn't an avid fan when it was published in 1990, I still couldn't help wonder why this was the book that Pynchon decided to put out there seventeen years after Gravity's Rainbow. The basic sentiment stands; it's inevitable that anything that he had published after Gravity's Rainbow would pale in comparison. That novel is wonderful, and despite my inability to explain exactly why it is, I have a hard time sincerely saying that his subsequent effort really matched up at all. So there it is, I've said it. I've been influenced by descriptions of Vineland, as well as my preconceived expectation for utter disappointment, and now I have to talk about it. However, Salman Rushdie seemed to have enjoyed it. His NYT review is glowing with beatnick-pastiche zeal. Vineland basically begins with Zoyd Wheeler, a burnt-out \"generic long-hair\" who is preparing to do his annual publicity stunt (jumping through the window of a bar) in order to cash in on his disability check issued by the government. His old arch-nemesis Hector Zuniga shows up looking for his old lady, Frenesi Gates, and is wondering; will Zoyd help the FBI and the DEA please find out where she is? His daughter Prairie is interested, as much as a young daughter could be in her counterculture/hippie/anarchist/ filmmaker mother. The narrative unfolds through old friends explaining Frenesi's tumultuous political existence to her estranged daughter. It's in this context that Pynchon covers a lot of ground. What follows is basically a critique of both the Nixon and Reagan years. It's mostly vitriol too, as Pynchon has obviously been harboring in many of these views since finishing Gravity's Rainbow. As usual, it isn't unbalanced because he makes a point of addressing the fact that the hippie movement had failed due to the way that this particular historical revolution had been sublimated by popular culture, television, drugs, rock and roll music, etc. This is all thanks to the American government, and a point that Pynchon wants to stress throughout the book. How is it though? I don't know. Maybe if I had read it when it just came out in 1990? Hunter S. Thomspon's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas covers the same ground, as well as countless other authors. Whether or not I actually have read enough about the 60's, I simply feel like I know too much about this point in history, and that my knowledge of which has been negatively influenced by romantic cliches. Most of Vineland's pomo zaniness feels stilted, due to this particular style being heavily exploited throughout the early nineties. Pynchon's tone and style seem weak throughout, making Vineland sound, at times, like someone ghostwriting for him. It just lacks the acerbic wit and humor that all of his previous novels embody. I don't think I need to remind too many people that the Crying of Lot 49 covered the same historical period in time with a little more...character. Is it great Pynchon, no. Is it bad Pynchon, no. It's just Pynchon, and personally that is a statment that I would like to avoid using."]], "review_count": "60", "description": "Vineland, a zone of blessed anarchy in northern California, is the last refuge of hippiedom, a culture devastated by the sobriety epidemic, Reaganomics, and the Tube.

That is probably for the best, though. I already conduct too much free labor for this corporatized library as is.More than half of the states composing the US owe their linguistic sustainability to the indigenous people, metaphorical roots which do little to combat sequestering in reservations and genocide everywhere else. It's not the only reason why I still get friend requests from people with whom a share nearly 300 works, of which a mere three are by women of color, but the situations run on the same fuel. Within the already sunken realm of writings by women of color there is still yet further stratification, and I will admit to having fallen into their trap while devoting two thirds of 2016's reading to this oft neglected but still hierarchical demographic.

However, that won't happen on its own, or in a vacuum, or without effort which should rightfully rest on the shoulders of those who rendered the language lethal in the first place, not those doing their best to survive it. #NoDAPL continues on despite assurances of victory, for that is only one branch of the beast sunk into the heart of myriad peoples, and such monstrosities always sleep with one of many eyes open.\nI watched rockshurled and smashedinto cars of old Mohawk menwomen and childrenon a bridgein Montrealand the million-dollarrock slideblockageson ten BC roadsafter stones rained down rock cliffson police liftinghuman blockadesprotecting the slow disintegrationof bones into sandresting under headstoneson Liliwat land-Jeanette Armstrong, Okanagan, 'I Study Rocks'"], ["I can't put into words how great this is.

He is almost a peer to his master Willy G. Christmas. Willy is a kind-hearted, but damaged man, a child of holocaust survivors. Given to delusions, and writing poetry, he is homeless and in failing health. The road trip here is a walking journey to Baltimore, home to Bea Swanson, beloved high school teacher. He wants to offer to her his mass of unpublished writings, and to find Mr. Bones a home before his swan song. According to Willy, on the other side of death lies Timbuktu, a place where everything is wonderful. The story is told in the third person omniscient, but really we are seeing the world through the eyes of Mr. Bones. Bones is not your typical dog. Although he lives in a world of scent and likes his bit of tail, he is a thoughtful critter. He is doggedly loyal to Willy, staying with him to the end. Auster takes things a bit beyond, as he likes to do. Bones not only thinks like a person, he dreams like one. Maybe his dreams are more like detailed premonitions. In one he transforms into an insect, then flies along with an ambulance to the hospital where Willy ultimately passes.Willy does pass on, so Bones has to make his way in the world alone. He tries hunting with minimal success, finds a meal ticket via a lonely Chinese boy named Henry Chow. The boy is afflicted with a father who hates dogs, and, most unsettling to Bones, he lives above a Chinese restaurant. He heads for the hills after dad finds out, and finds his way into a nice suburban home. The mom, Polly, and her young daughter, Alice, love him, as does the little boy, Tiger. But the home is not entirely happy and dad, Dick, is not thrilled about having a hairy animal around his pristine home. Even though his life has moved on, Bones is still visited in his dreams by the love of his life, Willy, and by the story\u2019s end, he is facing his own demise. Can dogs be admitted to Timbuktu as well as people?This may sound like a grim tale. It is not. It is a character portrait, of a dog and his man. A love story, with commentary on poetry, dreams, artistic ambitions, identity, what is important in life, with some observations about life in general and people in particular.

Look, if you are a dog owner, or have been or love dogs you have to read this book. I don't think dog books usually work, but this one does. You are in the head of a dog, Mr. Bones. You say, \u201cIt just cannot be good!\u201d but I swear it is. Mr. Bones is a scruffy dog. He has a hard life, all sorts of different owners. His first owner was Willy, a bit of a tramp but he had hard times, and then he died. Seven \"good\" years with Willy, but life goes on.....unless, unless he can get back to Willy! What makes this book special is that Paul Auster knows how dogs think. Yeah sure, a dog can get confused, but who doesn't?! Secondly, it is so damn funny. And sad....because sadness is tied to good memories. Love and happiness, hard times and good times and sadness, well, they all go together. Don\u2019t they?One thought of Mr. Bones: \"Just turn around the letters of dog and what do you have?\"The narration by Joe Barrett was superb. Couldn't be improved. He just reads the lines, adds only a bit of inflection just when needed. He knows when to pause. Tell me, does a book have to be serious to be considered worthy of four stars? I don't think so.

There is, indeed, a Symphony of Smells within, and other assorted delights. (Some plot spoiling follows.)Mr. Bones is smart, as dogs go. He knows what you're saying and is frustrated that he can't speak back. Wo\u00f3f! Wo\u00f3f! Wo\u00f3f! He is loyal, and cautious. He is not bitter about his dog's life. That's just how it is, you know. He had a ten-day affair with Greta, a malamute from Iowa City; other romances had been brief, impetuous.He learned most of what he knows from his first master, Willy G. Christmas, a promising young poet until college happened and Willy's mind followed the drugs. \"We're talking about highly combustible materials here, aren't we? You walk around with nitroglycerin in your brain, and sooner or later you're going to bump into something.\" But Mr. Bones learned some dog tricks and some human tricks too.He would have a short stay with Henry, a Chinese-American boy who hides Mr. Bones from his restaurant-owning father and re-names him 'Cal'. See, Henry is a Baltimore Orioles baseball fan. Mr. Bones has to flee to avoid being the 'Chicken' with broccoli and rice entr\u00e9e, or so he imagines.His next stop is a family of four. He is found by daughter Alice. Auster tells us that Alice is no ordinary person -- and isn't it nice that he only tells us that much? Alice's mother, Polly, is whom Mr. Bones falls for though. We do too. Her husband is appropriately named. Dick is the one who insists on getting Mr. Bones fixed.It is Polly who says, \"You understand what we're saying, don't you, old dog? ... You're a special one, aren't you? And you're tired and beat-up, and you need something to put in your belly. That's it, old-timer, isn't is? You're lost and alone, and every inch of you is tuckered out.\"You got that right, Polly.I really liked this. Chien \u00e0 tout faire.

This is what Paul Auster books would be like if he suddenly decided the murky world of convoluted, maze-like po-mo literature was not for him and thought \"I know, I'll write a nice book for children.\" Except this is a nice a book for adults. I was suckered in by the picture of the moist-eyed dog on the cover and the fact that this is on the 1001 books to read before you die list meant that of course I was going to read it. I'm pretty sure this comes under the Marmite book category (vegemite if you live in the upside down part of the world) where you either love it or hate it. In fact the only way to make it more of a Marmite read would be to toast it, smear the cover in butter and then apply a generous lashing of the aforementioned brewer's yeast by-product. This book is written from a dogs perspective and the narrative voice is that of a dog. I'm definitely a dog person so loved the idea of a book written through a canine perception of the world. Sadly this view point is given minus the cat chasing, butt licking and rolling in other dogs poop (why do dogs do that?) which whilst slightly more sanitary, does seem like a glaring omission. Mr Bones is the loving side-kick of urban camper Willy G Christmas.

When I saw the book available as Audible's Daily Deal for $3 I thought it was worth checking to see if this was the case, and I'm pleased to say that it was quite the opposite.As a massive dog lover, it quickly became apparent that I was going to empathise with the character of scruffy mongrel Mr Bones, and I quickly found myself relating my own wee dog's traits to his. When his original owner, Willy Christmas, an equally scruffy and mentally unstable character, passes away, we follow the dog as he wanders Baltimore's streets in search of a new owner, and interacts with a number of different humans.Auster does a superb job in portraying canine characteristics from the point of view of Mr Bones' stream of consciousness, without being too fantastical or patronising. I was gripped by the story, and found myself laughing out loud at times, and at the edge of my seat at others, as the mutt went about his business. Of course, we find out about the human characters in the novel via their interactions with Mr Bones or their interactions with each other in his presence, but it's definitely the mongrel who is the star. I couldn't stop myself listening on to finish this book in a couple of days. It's definitely one that I'll return to in future!"], ["I read this book in 2012 but didn't post a review at that time. This book has come to mind quite a bit recently as whenever I've been asked about my favourite books it keeps springing to mind. Must be telling me something!I'm a dog owner and dog lover and I think this is pertinent given this tale (or maybe I should have used the alternative spelling in this case) is told through the eyes of the four legged Mr Bones. In truth, I believe this book wouldn't have quite the same impact for anyone not enamoured with our canine friends.Mr B is loyal to his master who is going down hill fast. As he faces up to the fact that he's going to be left alone, Mr B goes on the hunt for a new master. One of the compelling aspects of this story is the unerring way Auster makes the reader believe he/she is actually listening to the thoughts of the dog - at least, that was my experience. It's a sweet, clever and emotional story and, because it's Auster, it's wonderfully written. It's short too, so can be gobbled up in a few sittings, without too much trouble. I'm a lover of Auster's work and this may or may not be his best, but it's certainly one of the most memorable. As an aside, another (the only other) book I've read that takes a similar approach - but in a very different story - is Suspect by Robert Crais. An excellent crime thriller in its own right."]], "review_count": "565", "description": "Mr. Bones, the canine hero of Paul Auster's astonishing new book, is the sidekick and confidant of Willy G.

It\u2019s July 4, 1981 (or is it 2003 or 2012 or all three, I don't know, the script doesn't say), barely twenty minutes before the fireworks are due to begin.LYDIA DAVIS (who has just arrived, it\u2019s her second party of the night and she\u2019s already tipsy): Hi, Sophie!SOPHIE CALLE: Bon jour, Lydia. Would you like a drink?LYDIA DAVIS: One more won\u2019t do any damage, I guess.Sophie notices her looking at a freshly made martini on the bar.SOPHIE CALLE: Here. Take one of these.LYDIA DAVIS: A votre sant\u00e9.SOPHIE CALLE: \u00c0 la votre.Lydia tilts her glass and downs the martini in one smooth movement.SOPHIE CALLE: Another?LYDIA DAVIS: Why not!Don DeLillo walks past, in the direction of the kitchen. He hasn\u2019t noticed Lydia yet. She air kisses Sophie goodbye and heads after Don, tapping him on the shoulder just as he enters the kitchen and reaches for the first hors d\u2019ouvre on a newly-assembled tray.DON DELILLO (turning around): Lydia, you look divine, fresh from your experience with Proust.LYDIA DAVIS: It\u2019s finished, mercifully.

In search of lost punctuation marks, as well, I suppose.Lydia has been watching over his shoulder, where through the kitchen window she has just spotted Paul Auster with a dazzling six foot tall blonde with an exquisite Scandinavian face who he has just met ten minutes before.LYDIA DAVIS: Don, who\u2019s that Amazon with Paul?Don turns around to see Paul Auster sit on the railing and then swing both feet around over the top, until they dangle above the street.

She tries to reclaim her glass from Don DeLillo, while pulling her right leg through behind her.DON DELILLO: Careful, Lydia...But, it\u2019s too late, the glass falls onto the kitchen floor as Lydia fails to clasp it securely, and she projects backwards into Siri, striking the vicinity of her left kidney with her elbow. Siri lets go of Paul Auster in agony, and Paul falls forward into the night sky, initially holding his hands out in a diving posture, before rocketing headlong in the direction of the street.A screaming comes up the hollow streetscape, even though barely a second has elapsed. Nobody has had time, let alone is game enough, to look down, until they hear the inevitable crash or thump.Yet, there is no crash or thump, and the screaming gets closer again.DON DELILLO (who seems to have some understanding of what\u2019s happened and calls out): What was it like, Paul?

Very much.REVIEW:Auster Railing SkepticismWhile I\u2019ve never had a negative experience with any of Paul Auster\u2019s novels, I detect a skepticism about his works on GoodReads, so was alert to what others might find questionable.Still, this book grabbed me from the first sentence and never let me go.Unlike some elements of his friend Don DeLillo that you have to excuse or laugh at, I found \u201cLeviathan\u201d word-perfect from beginning to end.The story is told in the first person, yet the narrator, writer Peter Aaron, is not the main character, who is another writer and Peter\u2019s best friend, Benjamin Sachs.Stylistically, the only reservation I have is about the detail with which Peter recounts Ben\u2019s story, which involves events and conversations (not all of them involving Peter) from over 15 years. Some of these conversations go for several pages. How did Peter remember them? As a writer, is he just a good listener? Is he just very retentive?Force of CircumstanceThe other issue which seems to concern some readers is the role of chance and coincidence in Auster\u2019s novels.While both play a role in \u201cLeviathan\u201d, I think they are a secondary, not a primary concern.Coincidences occur, but they are equally confounding for the characters affected by them.They are not [just] ridiculous set-ups or convenient solutions. They form part of a continuum of circumstance and circumstances, in which \u201canything can happen\u201d.For Peter, the events he witnesses are similar to what he does as an author, \u201cwriting stories, putting imaginary people into unexpected and often unlikely situations\u201d.Auster examines individuals within their environment, some of it physical, some of it mental, some of it social.He is interested in how Free Will, Intention, Determination, Causation, Knowledge and the Desire for Certainty interact with Determinism, Chance, Coincidence, Mystery, Randomness and Uncertainty.To what extent are we in control of the events that occur around us? What if the answer is very little? What if everything is improbable and unpredictable? What is the implication for our sense of identity and self-esteem?Can we live a life of happiness?Are our lives destined to end in catastrophe?This is what\u2019s happening at an abstract, meta-fictional level, yet the novel is written in a highly realist manner, in many places like detective fiction, as Auster tells us who-dunnit on the first page and then proceeds to tell us what.Personal PoliticsWe know from the first sentence that someone blew themselves up six days before today (which is July 4, 1990) and within pages, when two FBI agents visit Peter, we learn that it was Ben Sachs.Ben was interested in personal politics, not necessarily affiliated with any particular party, although he was idealistic and would no doubt have favoured the old-style Left Liberal Democrats over the Republicans, if he had to vote for one over the other.He was a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War and went to jail for his beliefs rather than abscond to Canada or Europe.Since then, he has grown more and more despondent as mainstream America embraced the conservative politics of Ronald Reagan and in his view betrayed the idealism of American Democracy that should be embodied and respected in the American Flag (which is now often a divisive symbol).\"The New Colossus\"The national icon that Sachs most objectifies and identifies with is the Statue of Liberty.It stands over New York Harbour like a new Colossus and holds the incandescent torch of Democracy and Freedom up high.However, its brightness has faded over time, and Sachs believes that this trend is symbolized by the proliferation of 130 fake miniature Statues of Liberty around the country.Sachs\u2019 first novel is actually named \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d after the poem that is engraved at the foot of the statue.As a boy in 1951, Sachs also experienced fear and apprehension, when his family climbed the staircase inside the statue and they grew increasingly scared of heights.Inside the WhaleThis experience of being inside and frightened leads to the second metaphor of the novel, the Leviathan itself, the great whale in the Biblical books of Job and Jonah, which Hobbes adopted as a metaphor for the State in his book of the same name.It\u2019s interesting that the Hebrew name upon which Leviathan is based can also refer to a dragon, which in Eastern culture can be an enemy of light.Thus, in Sachs\u2019 eyes, the name \u201cLeviathan\u201d symbolizes the tendency of the State to enclose and squash individuals, restrain their freedom and plunge them into darkness.No matter how much independence he shows in his personal life, he is gripped by the social and political claws of the Leviathan.As Sachs realises that his literary audience is declining and the message of his writing is going unheeded, he embraces more and more radical politics and quasi-terrorist tactics.The relatively innocent Peter Aaron sits by as he reconstructs the story of Sachs and his obsession, ultimately choosing for his own novel (and Auster\u2019s) the name of the novel that Sachs had only partly completed at the time of his death.Reversing FallsJust as the Statue of Liberty symbolizes light and the ascent of humanity, the decline of Democracy represent a metaphorical fall from grace and a descent into darkness.However, Sachs\u2019 childhood experience is replicated by a literal fall of his own, while attending a party to celebrate Independence Day in 1986, the 100th year of the statue's dedication.The parody at the beginning of this review is based on Aaron\u2019s/Auster\u2019s description of the event, which unfortunately preceded the days of widespread bungee jumping, but fortunately for Sachs was not fatal.Sachs\u2019 initial response to his recovery is to withdraw from those around him and maintain a silence:\"To be silent was to enclose himself in contemplation, to relive the moments of his fall again and again, as if he could suspend himself in midair for the rest of time \u2013 forever just two inches off the ground, forever waiting for the apocalypse of the last moment.\"Similarly, in his private life, his self disappears within a \u201csanctuary of inwardness\u201d. His retreat and silence shelter him from danger and temptation, but equally from the full experience and exuberance of life.Ultimately, he re-engages psychically and sexually. He also becomes more engaged politically, if only as a lonely anarchist working in the darkness, dangerously, symbolically drawing attention to how America is failing its own symbols, icons and values.Beware \"Leviathan\"When Peter Aaron discovers that Sachs has died, he starts writing his story.Without it, he knows that the only account of Ben\u2019s life and his activism will be the dossier prepared by the FBI agents, working inside the whale of the Leviathan, painting him as a terrorist.He rushes to piece together the reality of their shared life, under the deadline of a return visit from the FBI:\"The fact is that everyone dies, everyone disappears in the end, and if Sachs had managed to finish his book, there\u2019s a chance it might have outlived him.\"Ultimately, the importance of Aaron\u2019s book, Auster\u2019s novel, is that it encapsulates Sachs\u2019 warning even more effectively than Sachs might have been able to do himself in the end.The novel is a warning about the oppressive power of society, conformism and the State.These forces are the ones we have to look out for, not the distractions of chance and coincidence, which after all are mere entertainments in comparison.No matter how much Free Will we might think we have, there are other, more powerful forces at work.By writing Sachs\u2019 story, Aaron and Auster ensured that Sachs\u2019 message, \u201chis amulet against forgetting\u201d, outlived him, so that we might know the danger of Leviathan.Dedication:This review is dedicated to Bird Brian and the/his courage to speak out.In the words of George Orwell (from \"Inside the Whale\"), he fights the temptation to perform the \"Jonah act of allowing himself to be swallowed, remaining passive, accepting\", in other words, \"quietism\".For any non/un-Americans who mightn't be familiar with it, here is the full text of the poem at the foot of the Statue of Liberty:The New Colossusby Emma LazarusNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles. From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries sheWith silent lips. \"Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"], ["Leviathan, Paul Auster Leviathan is American writer Paul Auster\u2019s seventh novel, published by Viking Press in 1992.

What is it about ? The book is told in a rather complex way: a writer tells the FBI everything he knows about a certain Benjamin Sachs, from the day he made his acquaintance, until the fateful day. He goes through all the details, all the meetings, all the choices that have been made and which have led to that conclusion. A little as if life was a gigantic spider's web, and we always have the choice between several options that lead us to a definite \"exit\", but which could have been quite different if the choices made had been different.A book presented as a kind of thriller at the beginning, but that is not finally a thriller. It's just the story of a guy who made choices, and the outcome that goes with it.Lisbon Book-Fair 2016."], ["I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so emotionally draining as Paul Auster's Leviathan. I have been reading it at work for the last week or so, and finally in the home stretch of the last hundred pages today, I started walking around with my head down and my coworkers kept asking if I was okay. That's a feat to behold.Auster's books are some of the most finely crafted works I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Maybe the stories don't always get wrapped up cleanly, or the characters seem motiveless and unlikeable at times, but each sentence is a well-delivered punch. In Leviathan, Auster's narrator talks about his approach to writing fiction, how he painstakingly hammers out each word, and it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if he were reflecting on his own style. Or else he's just really lucky and knows how to put ideas perfectly into amazingly worded sentences that form paragraphs of unparalleled power. In that case, screw him for not having to work hard when the rest of us do.But Leviathan isn't just about writing despite its revolving around two writers. Really, it is about the writers themselves, on a much deeper, human level. It's a story about character and what changes character and how people deal with those changes whether they want to or not. The first two thirds of the book are development of character, and the last third is a revolving door of switch-arounds of those characters that spin them, and their worlds, out of control.That, of course, is the depressing part--seeing the people you've come to love like family (how couldn't you, as much as Auster tells you about them?) lose themselves completely. In terms of literature, it's extremely satisfying, but it is still painful to watch. As much as I loved the book, I hated it in a way, for getting me so emotionally involved without my even noticing, and then dashing all my hopes and dreams as it came to an (unfortunately expectedly) abrupt close. But then, isn't that the mark of an excellent piece of literature? Probably. But did it really have to break my heart?"], ["In terms of American writers, Auster stands up there being so unique, a writer one must read at least once. He\u2019s remarkably talented here and his originality continues to impress me.Leviathan literally means the biggest of its kind, and was also a sea monster from the Old Testament. Knowing such things illuminates Auster\u2019s reasoning behind titling his book as such.In this tale, Peter Aaron\u2019s friend, Ben Sachs-a once-promising author-accidentally blows himself up along a rural road using a homemade bomb. Though it\u2019d been years since Peter had communicated with his best-friend, he takes it upon himself to tell the story of how Ben had come to such an alarming and unusual end. Since Sachs had been working on an abandoned novel called Leviathan, Peter (and Auster) calls his book the same. Peter recounts his first meeting with Ben, and from there writes about their lives spent together and apart, along with all the friends and lovers that entered their lives and changed their fates with the smallest of intricacies and nuances. Peter hopes to finish his book and elucidate the public on Ben and his bomb-making before the Feds bring shame upon Sachs\u2019 name.I was totally drawn into this story, and that's what Auster is all about, he is storyteller. I want to make it abundantly clear that I consider most of Auster\u2019s books worth looking at. Even Auster\u2019s weaker still leaves fans wanting more. Leviathan was utterly interesting and a page-turner, but where this differs slightly from his other work, there is far more chance of this actually happening in the real world.Leviathan employs regular Auster themes such as isolation, the complexity of interpersonal relationships, and the desire to discard an identity and begin anew. Leviathan also focuses on the ironic intersections and coincidences in life, and Auster weaves and melds seemingly meaningless occurrences early in the novel into rather important plot devices all the way to the story\u2019s end. The three-fold meaning of the book\u2019s title alone illustrates the care Auster takes in layering his ironies. Stayed in my mind long after reading, and have since read again. I would say it's him at his best, it's one I would certainly recommend for anybody yet to read him , because it's far easier to comprehend. Written in the 90's, it still says a lot about America of today.

Apenas um exemplo: Paul Auster inspirou-se nos trabalhos da fot\u00f3grafa francesa contempor\u00e2nea Sophie Calle (n. 1953) para criar a personagem de Maria Turner, com um m\u00e9todo paradigm\u00e1tico onde os rituais di\u00e1rios s\u00e3o registados em imagens fotogr\u00e1ficas de vidas an\u00f3nimas, reinventando identidades aleatoriamente - tal como o escritor faz com as suas personagens -, num expediente em que as vidas fict\u00edcias s\u00e3o circunscritas por eventos do passado e que moldam os comportamentos e as atitudes no presente e no futuro.Em \u201dLeviathan\u201d todas as personagens secund\u00e1rias s\u00e3o inesquec\u00edveis(view spoiler)[: Fanny Sachs (a bonita mulher de Benjamin Sachs, mais tarde, amante de Peter Aaron), Delia Aaron (a primeira mulher de Peter Aaron), David (o filho de Peter e Delia), Iris (a segunda mulher de Peter Aaron, que mais n\u00e3o \u00e9 o nome da esposa de Paul Auster invertido, Siri, Siri Hustvedt (n. 1955), ela tamb\u00e9m escritora), Maria Turner (a fot\u00f3grafa e amante de Peter Aaron) e Lillian Stern (uma ex-prostituta, a melhor amiga de Maria Turner e amante de Peter Aaron) (hide spoiler)].Paul Auster \u00e9 um mestre na inven\u00e7\u00e3o ou na reinven\u00e7\u00e3o das personagens, congregando coincid\u00eancias com o prop\u00f3sito, por vezes tortuoso, de criar premissas circunstantes e sentimentais para os epis\u00f3dios casuais e inesperados do dia-a-dia, numa reflex\u00e3o entre o real e o metaf\u00f3rico. \u201dLeviathan \u00e9 um romance com uma escrita genial e minimalista, um romance dentro de outro romance, abordando in\u00fameros temas como: a procura da identidade, o sucesso e o fracasso na produ\u00e7\u00e3o e na cria\u00e7\u00e3o liter\u00e1ria, o acaso e a coincid\u00eancia, sobre a natureza d\u00edspar e evasiva da verdade e da mentira, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o amor e o adult\u00e9rio, as quest\u00f5es relacionadas com os conflitos pessoais e existenciais, sobre aos assuntos da fidelidade e da trai\u00e7\u00e3o, sobre a abstin\u00eancia e a indulg\u00eancia, as d\u00favidas sobre a moralidade e a lux\u00faria, igualmente, sobre a tem\u00e1tica do terrorismo, e in\u00fameras interroga\u00e7\u00f5es e indaga\u00e7\u00f5es sobre situa\u00e7\u00f5es improv\u00e1veis do quotidiano.

I should start by saying that Auster changed a lot of my perspectives throughout this book (nah, not revolutionary stuff). Auster delves into these characters so deeply and invests in their habits, attitudes, feelings so much we can't help but forget that it is but a work of fiction but there was so much detail paid to these characters (and what beautiful characters they were, complex souls that breathed). I know, for a fact that I liked this book but as I slowly got deeper and deeper into Auster's world or rather his characters and the philosophy of the characters it slowly dawned on me that I felt a sort of special connection with this book that I couldn't yet explain to myself. I also like books which acknowledge the fact that they are books which made the ending better. I would've rather given this a 4.5 because the plot, albeit being great did not evoke that much emotion out of me. In the book, Auster- or rather Paul is consistently reminding us that there are gaps in his stories or that most of the information he is receiving might be false, exaggerated and I really like that? He isn't trying to mask the fact that this story isn't the most exciting, instead he rather acknowledge the gaps in his knowledge which makes it seem all the more honest and realistic. I've been searching for a book that engulfs narrative with thought and here, Auster has presented me with Leviathan. And then it hit me one night when I was on the phone with Mikhail that this is the kind of book that I would've written (I don't mean the plot). The language, his perspectives, the characters, they were all fixtures of my mind. This is almost exactly the novel I would produce if I was more articulate and had a higher ability to compile my thoughts and generate them into characters. It was this crazy, weird sense of De ja vu like MAN, I KNOW what he's talking about, I don't just understand what this guy's saying, I KNOW what he's saying. Sure, I've enjoyed pieces of fiction before this but no writer has managed to connect the way Auster has had with me and god- that is so AMAZING because I didn't even think that was possible. It feels as if Auster body jacked me and jumped forward in time and wrote a book- that sounds crazy but it feels as if this book was written for me or according to me. I can't say this novel'll make you FEEL but it'll make you think and the things that it makes you realize, the small, seemingly insignificant things\u2026 this is way too self-flattering, here I am basically saying that this guy is actually me and I wrote an amazing novel- ahh. I don't know how to make sense of this to anyone else or explain how it makes me feel but I just really enjoyed the characters in this book and how deeply Auster explored them and the widths of human nature and behavior."], ["Video reviewA veritable dream if you are a fan of mysterious first-person narratives about Terrible Things that Must Be Told before Something Bad Happens.

Occasionally mawkish, occasionally so precise it takes your breath away, a kind of balancing act where every action is at once banal and loaded with meaning, like a sort of weird combination of Chekhov and Guy de Maupassant: O Henry stories without the trick endings, or as if the story was all trick. The back cover calls this \"a singular kind of ars poetica, a literary manifesto without theory,\" which is true enough. Because the pieces in this book are so short -- the book itself is about the size of a mass-market paperback, but much thinner, and most of the stories vary in length from three or four pages to just one -- the dreamlike quality which in Auster's longer works can seem twee or forced works here to great effect. Dreams are the result of the mind struggling to make connections between seemingly random memories, images, perceptual chunks, wishes, God knows what thrown off by the brain as we lie physically paralyzed, beyond touch and sound, reduced to visions and the attempts to connect those visions (this is why dreams seem so choppy and surreal -- most of them are apparently three or four \"mini-dreams\" stitched together). Auster's thesis here is apparently that just as our minds try to do this in dream-time, so they do it with random, unconnected elements of life, at once as banal and loaded with meaning as a dream where you see a childhood friend and they offer you a candy bar you can't eat (because in a dream, you are cut off from taste; in your mind, you are cut off from the sweetness of childhood, the easy emotional connections of a child, you wake up with the memory of untasted, untastable chocolate in your mind and are moody until coffee). In these stories, prison guards turn into father-in-laws, brothers into husbands, a dead child into a kind of sacrificial double. One man grows up with his mother, hearing her version of his childhood and his father; by utmost chance, he finds his father again, and hears the predictable reverse of his mother's story: in his father's narrative, she was the monster. Auster writes: \"C.'s life had now become two lives. There was Version A and Version B, and both of them were his story. He had lived them both in equal measure, two truths that canceled each other out, and all along, without even knowing it, he had been stranded in the middle.\" As a child, Auster had rescued a friend of his sister's from being crushed under the wheels of his father's car: \"For years afterward, I walked around feeling that this had been my finest moment. I had actually saved someone's life, and in retrospect I was always astonished by how quickly I had acted, by how sure my movements had been at the critical juncture. I saw the rescue in my mind again and again....\" Inevitably, when he meets her again fifteen years later, \"....it was clear that she remembered nothing....She hadn't even known that she was in danger. The whole incident had taken place in a flash: ten seconds of her life, an interval of no account, and none of it had left the slightest mark on her. For me, on the other hand, those seconds had been a defining experience, a singular event in my internal history.\"But the final trick of that story, concealed from the audience by the misdirection of separate but equal perspectives, is its last paragraph, which has the same impact as realizing both that the childhood friend in your dream is eternally now, here with you in your mind, and that you will never see him again; that even the child who appears in the dream is not the child you knew, just as you could not taste the offered chocolate. \"Most of all,\" Auster writes, \"it stuns me to acknowledge that I am talking about something that happened in 1956 or 1957 -- and that the little girl of that night is now over forty years old.\" Time is the fifth dimension in which we live, and dream, and lose, against which we shore fragments of meaning to shield ourselves from the ceaseless rain of atoms: Then, the phone rang and it was her. They had grown up in the same building without knowing it.

Situations where what's being said and what's being done are at odds and places where the postcard picture hides ugly, painful truths. Her non-fiction is the opposite of easy reading: the sentences uncurl slowly, and sometimes you don't quite know where she's taking a paragraph or a page until the last few words, when suddenly everything stabs into focus. And given the length of this book (1122 pages), the time-span it covers (forty plus years), the enormous geography (an incomplete list: New York, California, Mexico, Hawaii, El Salvador, Miami, Washington), and the range of subjects (crime, politics, hydrology, civil war, personal history, social history, and more), you might expect it to be a difficult read. But you'd be wrong. Didion is engaging start to finish, as good a writer at 75 as she was at 35, or vice-versa. I'm not sure if there's any subject she could make dull- if one exists, it's been omitted here.

The standard review cliches come to mind - spare, taut, elegant, polished, not a word out of place. All true. And yet, I admire these pieces, but I don't love them. There's a coldness at the core of Didion's writing that terrifies me.

Before this book, I had only read The Year of Magical Thinking (which I *loved*) but Didion had always held a certain fascination for me because I had the hugest crush on Ed O'Brien of Radiohead for the longest time and he said Joan Didion was his favorite writer and his dream woman. So of course I set about finding out who this lady was, and whether she was worthy of this praise. :) The crush has long since faded (though I still think he's dreamy) but my crush on Didion continues unabated. This collection is a particular gift to lazy types like myself; I know I would have found it such a pain to acquire all of her non-fiction separately, and in chronological order, so I'm very glad Everyman did it for me. My favorite essays so far include \"On Self-Respect\", \"Goodbye to all That\", \"In the Islands\" and \"Pacific Distances\", but really it's like picking a favorite child.

Ostensibly a review of Tracy Daugherty\u2019s \"The Last Love Song\" (St. Martin\u2019s), a biography of Joan Didion, this article is really an overview of Didion's career and the evolution of her world view. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201...The only thing I would like to add is this quote from John Leonard in his introduction to this collection: \"...I have been trying forever to figure out why her sentences are better than mine and yours ... something about cadence. They come at you, if not from ambush, then in gnomic haikus, icepick laser beams, or waves. Even the space on the page around these sentences is more interesting than it ought to be, as if to square a sandbox for a Sphinx.\" Yes! This is what makes her prose so compelling. Even in the early pieces that make me distinctly uncomfortable, like her sensationalized portrayal of the counterculture, or the Black Panthers, or her (especially) wrong headed dismissal of radical feminism, I find it hard to shake off that prose and certainly will not forget it. Of course, this makes it all the more delicious when she turned her focus to the emptiness behind the traditional picture of the American Dream (especially California Style), to the dissection of US foreign policy in Central America, and to dismantling the Political Class in America and their media sycophants. It is the quality of her prose style that places her among the greats of the New Journalism, along side Hunter S. Thompson; it also makes me want to find the time to read some of her fiction."], ["We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live is a collection of Didion's nonfiction work, including Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album, Salvador, Miami, After Henry, Political Fictions, and Where I Was From, stopping in 2003 before the deaths of her husband and daughter. I got bogged down in the more historical and political essay collections and took a long break after Miami but picked it back up and finished reading. Slouching Towards Bethlehem and The White Album are stellar, with Didion's sparse and biting prose describing the way of life and climate of the 1960's. Didion's essays on more personal topics, like keeping a journal, are insightful and interesting. Where I Was From comes back to this theme and is the later of Didion's work that I enjoyed best. The more historical and political focused ones are less interesting. I'm not sure if I got bogged down in Didion's somewhat indignant tone or maybe the actions of the United States in the latter half of the 20th century are just going to be very depressing. In Political Fictions especially, with the focus American politics of the 1990's, Didion took a heavy hand in condemning those involved. It's justly deserved criticism, but lacks the variety in topic of some of Didion's other work. I'm glad I stuck with this one, and Slouching Towards Bethlehem I would definitely read again."], ["Incredible.

Here's a go:I'd only previously read \"The Year of Magical Thinking\" by Didion--and, considering my admittedly non-existent experience with having lost loved ones, didn't connect to it in the way so many seem to have (at least on an emotional level). Nonetheless, I found her prose style there to be breathtaking, and it's in full form in this short collection. Vintage Didion collects essays from several books--three from \"After Henry,\" three from \"Miami,\" two from \"Salvador,\" one from \"Political Fictions,\" and one based on a lecture concerning September 11th. Truly, every essay was spot-on, though Didion really confronts me with the fact that I'm pathetically unsavvy with politics. The essay on NY and the Central Park Jogger case was perhaps one of the best non-fiction essays I've ever read. Though it's clear she's done her research and doesn't mind showing as much, it comes across as astute rather than showy, fluid rather than stuffed full of other people's facts and writings. Her logic is fascinating to watch, in the sense that she moves from the most micro-level observations into smart arguments about much much larger questions. Thus, the Central Park Jogger case becomes an essay on ideologies of crime and class, specific to NYC over the past 150 years, but reaching outward, as well. And then she sweeps back into her initial arresting claims. The essay on good ol' Bill's sexual exposure in \"Clinton Agonistes\" was particularly provocative, as was the Sept. 11th essay, and the one on Patty Hearst. I think I was swimming too deep in the Salvador/Miami pieces, but they too are beautifully written and argued.I'm really looking forward to moving through more of her work--and as a close friend tells me, I'm an awful idiot and a bad Lit PhD for not having read her novel \"Play It As It Lays.\" Any case, this is probably a great introduction to Didion--at least to her more politically-minded work. I'm trying to think of lovely descriptors for her, but the one that sticks out most for me at the moment is 'shrewd'--she's got a hawk's eye to everything she mentions, and watching her follow through that sightline into an argument is inspiring. Read it, for sure."], ["I think Joan Didion is at her best when she's talking about California- about its culture, its news, or her history there. Her strength decreases the further from California she gets: she's pretty good writing about New York (which, I think, is closer to California than much of the country in between), and less good writing about Miami and El Salvador. This collection of essays spans all of those territories, and about twenty-five years in her career, from the late 70s to about 2003. The highlights involve crimes: the Patty Hearst case, the Central Park Jogger case, 9/11. She's also got a few good ones about politics- mostly about the major scandals in the Reagan and Clinton administrations. Nothing here is as earthshaking as her classic essays \"Goodbye to All That\" or \"Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream\", but they're all solid, interesting pieces. Good enough that I'm considering buying her omnibus \"We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live\" to get the rest of the books that these essays were pulled from."], ["Collection of Didion's work from Miami, \nAfter Henry\n, Salvador, and Political Fictions.

Full blog post here: https://theselittlewords.com/2017/10/..."], ["If you haven't read much from Joan Didion, this is a good place to start. Vintage Didion covers a selection of her more powerful essays over a period of almost 40 years.You'll notice, as you read, the strong skepticism that Didion brings to her journalistic essays. It's not that she necessarily has a political bend in one direction or another, it is that she is committed to looking around and fully rendering the context of each event she reports on, complete with historic details showing how the past has led to each moment she captures. This necessarily leads to her having some visible levels of contempt for people who would ignore details, gloss over the uglier connections between institutions, or impose a narrative on events.Not only does Didion commit herself to exploring the \"wide view\" of an event in order to show the confluence of viewpoints and past actions that influence the choices made during historic moments, she does so with the sense of a Gideon--an almost-too-wise observer who is there not to render judgment herself, but to observe the imposition of an inevitable judgment dictated by the circumstances of our actions. Her knowing contempt for the selfish, magical thinking that both leads to tragedy and prevents our learning from it is simply the fatigue of an observer who has witnessed similar events to these before and who can not believe that the people around her do not remember the confluence of power, privilege, and short-term thinking that bring about the new iterations of tragedy, exploitation, and genocide that she finds herself covering.Didion's voice should not be the only one you listen to if you're reviewing the political landscape of the last half century, but she is definitely a voice you should be listening to. Her easy way of separating the narrative we agree to impose on events from the events themselves is unbelievably necessary to a balanced understanding of the complex relationship between power and cultural forces, and the ways that both are exploited in order to shape the world to fit the collective desires of a relatively few individuals.I would recommend moving from here to Political Fictions or Salvador, but not immediately. Your appreciation for (and recognition of the limitations of) Didion's style and voice will be better if you approach her work in context, by taking the \"big picture\" view for yourself and mixing your approach to her work with a large variety of other essayists and historians of the latter half of the twentieth century. The only way to truly appreciate essays that are this steeped in the culture of their times is by developing a sense of the writer's own view, and to do that you need to immerse yourself in the voices that surrounded her on the pages of the various publications where these articles originally appeared."], ["The pieces on Ronald and Nancy Reagan ('In the Realm of the Fisher King'), Bill Clinton ('Clinton Agonistes') and the Central Park jogger case ('Sentimental Journeys') are the brightest parts of this anthology, culled from other works - but there really are no missteps here. The sheer breadth of Didion's research is astounding, especially as she reveals the fuzzy thinking of both presidents and newswriters alike. The final essay, based on a lecture given in 2002, 'Fixed Opinions, or the Hinge of History' is the best review of the American government's skewing of logic to justify the 'war on terror' that I've ever read.

The thing that immediately stood out to me about Amazons is how strong an influence it must have been on Wallace's first novel, The Broom Of The System. Some of the dialogue here is strikingly similar and the rational and overwhelmed central female protagonist, Lenore Beadsman, struggling through a world of neurotic men in Wallace's novel seems heavily based on Cleo Birdwell and her many suitors.This is an excellent book, laugh-out-loud funny, and the best of the five or six DeLillo novels I've read.

What the book is mostly about is men who are surrounded by other men in what is basically a testosterone/masculinity contest seeking out the warmth and tenderness of a woman who can give them a reprieve from that: most of these men are scumbags. there is also a massive subplot about the distinction between sickness and health and that arbitrariness of disease. in some ways this novel is remarkable, and in some ways it is really dull. out of print, unfortunately, but worth reading if you can get your hands on it."], ["Pretty damn hilarious. Don DeLillo must have had a lot of fun with this one."], ["\"Cleo's in a pretty unique position.\"That's the first line of the back-cover copy. I like it better as an intro than the oft-quoted first line of the book: \"If a man's name sounds right whether you say it forwards or backwards, it means he went to Yale.\" Cleo is referring there to a man named Sanders Meade, one of the many strange men vying for her attention.You might wonder who an avowed sports cipher (I try to watch sports, it's just...nothing sticks) why I'd read a memoir about the first woman to play in the National Hockey League. You might wonder until you realize 1. it's a novel, not a memoir, and 2. it's by Don Delillo, not \"Cleo Birdwell.\"There you go. Now it all makes sense.Because I dedicated myself a year and a half ago to reading all of Delillo's novels (we'll....we'll see about the plays), I had to go deep, and that included a book that he wrote under an assumed name and has since had officially expunged from his bibliography. It's long out of print, and you have to be pretty watchful to find a reasonably-priced copy, but I gotta say, it's worth the hunt! (If you need further professional/literary verification that it's good, it's received high marks from both Jonathan Lethem and David Foster Wallace, whose annotated copy of Amazons can be found amongst his papers. Also, here's a cool article about Amazons by an author named Victoria Patterson, who wrote her own contemporary female-led fictitious sports memoir and her relationship to Delillo's book: http://www.theweeklings.com/vpatterso...)As the lurid cover suggests, this is a relatively steamy (by Delillo standards) book about a female hockey player in a man's world. She's from the small town of Badger, OH, and she's pretty canny and smart and reads the works of the philosopher Wadi Assad (author of The Mystic Prince I, The Barefoot Rose, or The Romance of Being). I mean, most of the team (and a share of her paramours) are reading Assad, too. But still, she seems to understand it better than them.This to me felt like the second part of a two-part investigation Delillo was conducting in the late '70s in which he was trying to write fully-formed female characters that were also sexually open without being a one-dimensional male fantasy. Moll in Running Dog is definitely Cleo's predecessor here. She jumped from situation to situation while still keeping her eye on the investigation, having fun and goin' for hers without having to be punished for it, or being regretful for not going with Mr. Right or whatever. Cleo has enough sex in this to make Southern's Candy blush, but without being thrown around by forces beyond her control. It helps that Cleo is smart and canny, but her guy suitors are in no way her equal. Some are sweet, some mean well, but many of them (especially the aforementioned Sanders Meade) don't realize how lucky (or broken) they are.Amazons is a well-written sex farce in the classic style. One male after another tries to seduce Ms. Birdwell throughout her first season with the Philadelphia Rangers, but none of them seem up to the task. Cleo's agent, the perpetually nervous Floss Penrose, has a new tennis protege named Archie Brewster, who is always jetlagged and consents to regularly playing Strip Monopoly with Floss. Cleo tries to lure him away, but he falls asleep; she has to drag him to her room by throwing him on an area rug and dragging it like Edmund Hilary up the stairs. Then there's Shaver Stevens, an ex-hockey man himself and very much Cleo's equal. Sadly, he's afflicted with a hazy, hard to cure ailment called Jumping Frenchman Disease. He's later put into sleep state with a machine called a Kramer box for six months, hoping that his body will work itself out after six months of R&R. Then there's Sanders Meade, the Yale man with the interchangeable name. He wants to do it in the worst way, but certain subjects turn him off. One is the member of a certain member of the team -- Eric Torkleson, whose praiseworthy penis has been named Torkle by everyone else on the team. An ill-timed mention of \"Torkle\" sends Sanders into a shame spiral. The other is \"the twin spectres of Vietnam and Watergate,\" to use his own words. Then there's sportswriter Murray Jay Siskind, who eagle-eyed Delillo readers will remember is Jack Gladney's colleague in White Noise, a \"visiting lecturer on living icons.\" (He and Jack pace the floor while comparing Elvis and Hitler.) He can barely control himself while Cleo describes her bucolic, quintessentially Midwestern upbringing in Badger, Ohio especially the traditions of Christmas night. Tell me about the carolers again. No...slower.....The book is full of weird little storylines like this. Murray Jay is thinking about quitting sportswriting because of his new obsession, a story guaranteed to blow the lid off, as old newspaperman might say: it's an expose about how the snowmobile industry is entirely Mafia-run. Then there's James Kinross, the owner of the team who would rather tell Cleo about all his violent hyjinks as a youth then chase her around the office: \"Anyone come into our neighbourhood, we\u2019d crack their fuggin heads open. I opened more heads than a brain surgeon. We used to break aerials offa cars and use them for weapons. Swish swish. Whip one of them things across somebody\u2019s face, he\u2019s gonna be looking at glass eyes on a jeweller\u2019s tray. We used entire steering wheels. We ripped entire steering wheels out of cars. All our weapons came from cars, except for rocks. Not lot many cars have rocks for parts. Our rocks came from empty lots. We used to have rock fights at point-blank range in empty lots. You wouldn\u2019t believe the blood, the guys out cold, the guys staggering around holding their open heads\u2014it was fuggin urban mayhem.\"As you might have gathered, Amazons is Delillo's funniest book by far. Really funny, not just \"oh, how droll.\" Well, it's both, actually. It's funny like this: \"I reached up with my right hand and grabbed the hair at the back of his head and just jerked the whole mass of hair, skull, and flesh back out of my face. It was like pulling a toy arrow with a rubber suction up off a wall. It made a noise that sounded like Platt, Utah, although I don\u2019t know if there is such a place.\" and it's droll like this:\"If the president is described as looking fit and trim, or trim and fit, it means he has had a good night\u2019s sleep, he has had some fresh-squeezed orange juice upon awakening, and we have not lost further leverage in the Horn, the Rim, the Gulf, or the Corridor overnight. After presidential vacations, trim and fit becomes tanned and fit. This is automatic. Either way, it is a term I associate with people who have enough money to be happily obese, out of shape, and generally wasted, jowly, and dissipated, out drinking and screwing every night, but who have resolved to be fit and trim out of a deep sense of duty. In other words, fitness and trimness are moral qualities, and when the president is described as being fit and trim, we should all feel better. Power has its darker side, of course, and this same president will be described two days alter as looking tired and drawn. This isn\u2019t so bad. When he is called pale and haggard, however, or grey and shaken, he is having problems right down the line, personal and otherwise. Weary and beat means the job is just too much for him, and if you read that he is looking haunted and ashen, it probably means he is getting ready to board Air Force One for the ultimate scenario.\"Then there's this, a perfect summation of made-for-TV movies circa 1980:\"Natasha was watching a movie made for TV. It had that glossy look. They spritz the whole set with hair spray. The actors have carved faces and move about on casters. Every third shot is a zoom into a frightened woman\u2019s teeth.\"The book takes the occasional dark turn, and it's pretty long for a humor book, but it's got a far better hit ratio than I expected. The one clunker joke/thing is in the last third of the book, when a Saudi sheik buys the team and initiates compulsory 4 a.m. bed checks. They go even further by demanding that Cleo wear a veil the next season. Very \"Up the Academy,\" minus ensuing hijinx. I guess it's not for me as a dude to declare that another dude did a really good job writing a woman who is both sexually active but also dignified, so I'll leave that for my lady friends who might want to give this a try and decide for themselves. I liked it, I thought it erred on the right side of the equation -- making the dudes lunks rather than her a sexual naif -- while still keeping her flawed and intriguing. It's also a damn sight sexier than that awful sex scene in Americana. Do you need to read this? Unless you're a Delillo obsessive, maybe not, and honestly, the scarcity of it doesn't make your decision that hard. If you do come upon a copy, though, I'd say go for it -- it's a nice harbinger of the more humorous and humane side that came out in White Noise, while being a far faster and more straightforward read -- no pondering over architecturally jaw-clenching sentences here. It's fast and loose and kooky and a lot of fun."], ["I would say I was definitely interested in reading Don DeLillo writing a memoir about the first woman to play in the NFL. And there are parts of it that are great-- weird turns of phrase and some lovely sentences, flashes of his \"big\" themes, especially those that crop up in books like _White Noise_, for example, ideas about health and medicine (I wish there was a whole series of medical mysteries, a la the novels of Robin Cook, that DeLillo had written). Some stuff about consumerism, some about consumer churn. A lot about NYC, and a lot of broad pastiche about places that aren't NYC.But the book as a whole is kind of an eh. I didn't expect it to be serious, but I didn't expect to be bored or find the last seventy-five pages of section two tedious, and I kind of did. There are striking moments throughout, but some of them-- especially the cross-cutting between sex and monologues, while funny at the level of concept, maybe didn't totally work as executed.I'm glad I read it, but completely understand why some others who read it don't push it on everyone else."], ["Strange how Don DeLillo's distanced himself from Amazons, which, with its deadpan asides, repetitions, absurd interactions and set pieces, uniquely foregrounds his comic approach. It sits well against his other sports novel, End Zone; and the \"Kramer box\" anticipates the Convergence capsules in Zero K."], ["Pretty weird book imho!!"], ["(http://www.opinionless.com/goodreads-...)Remember Cleo Birdwell? No? She was supposedly the first woman to play hockey in the NHL and \u201cAmazons\u201d is her supposed memoir. Funny thing is though, it was actually written by Don DeLillo in the early 80\u2019s right around the same time as one of his most famous novels, \u201cWhite Noise.\u201d As a matter of fact, sportswriter character Murray Jay Siskind actually appears in both works.Why does DeLillo refuse to acknowledge writing this in any of his official bibliographies and why hasn\u2019t he allowed it to be republished since its initial release? Your guess is as good as mine, but the fact that it is not easily available to the masses is tragic because it\u2019s one of his best efforts.If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Don DeLillo, most of his body of work tackles heavy topics such as nuclear war, global terrorism, mathematics, 9/11, and the Kennedy assassination. \u201cAmazons\u201d however is something altogether different; it\u2019s a comic masterpiece that addresses the average American\u2019s two greatest obsessions: sports and sex.As previously mentioned, \u201cAmazons\u201d is the tale of Cleo Birdwell, supposedly the first woman to play hockey in the NHL. We follow her exploits, narrated by her, over the course of an entire season. When she\u2019s not playing hockey, which is for most of the book, she\u2019s sleeping with just about everyone who is somehow connected to the team. Each guy she hooks up with though, has his own, strange, fucked up thing when it comes to sex. One gets flaccid at the sound of the word \u201cWatergate,\u201d one can only get aroused by giving long speeches in French, one has jumping Frenchmen disease (yes, this is actually a real thing), one has to be told tales of small town America in order to become aroused, the list actually goes on and on. Our Cleo may be great on the ice, but she\u2019s even better between the sheets.Personally, my favorite thing about DeLillo as an author is the way he writes conversations and his ability to make beautiful the smallest of seemingly meaningless moments. Reading \u201cAmazons\u201d was like taking those best bits from any serious DeLillo novel, turning them on their head so they become over the top in their absurdity, and then inserting them into a comedy. Simply put it shouldn\u2019t work at all, but it does perfectly.I\u2019m jonesing for an entire Cleo Birdwell series of novels. I want some up and coming \u201cdocumentary\u201d filmmaker to turn this thing into a mega movie franchise (though it may end up being a little too NC-17\u2026). It\u2019s hard for me to do because it\u2019s so hilarious, but I have to admit that after \u201cWhite Noise\u201d this novel is my favorite thing DeLillo\u2019s ever done."], ["This was clearly DeLillo's guilty pleasure book. That's fine except that the guilt was well earned. It's just not a very good book. Yes, there are a few funny moments of social satire and a few characteristic metafictive reflections; however, they're just too few and far between. My biggest disappointment was that he didn't do more to mimic and/or play with the \"fake memoir\" form. After the first few pages, there was barely a mention of it being a memoir (or of it acting like a memoir). Really, a few pages in, it simply began to read like a standard first-person novel. The memoir ruse was all but gone as I read further into the book. Furthermore, there's much to be said (too much to get into here) about how masculinist the supposed female viewpoint here tends to be. All in all, I suppose I understand why DeLillo has yet to claim Cleo Birdwell.

(Gold $400->$1000, Oil $60->$110, etc.)I personally agree with many of his general thoeries:1.) We are at a supply limit on crude oil. Growth in this environment is going to be down right impossible.2.) Consequently, serious inflation (ala the 1970's) is coming our way.3.) The Fed will lack the ability and wherewithal to affect monetary policy to fight the inflation. Because the limited supply of the products we need to sustain, monetary policy alont can't correct it, without a serious economic downturn.

What Leeb calls tax breaks for oil companies are ridiculous misunderstandings of the business and why those tax benefits are in the code.1.) Depeletion -> No other industry is producing from reservoirs (cash streams) that are 10-35% less every year. 2.) Deduction of Drilling Costs -> You CAN NOT treat drilling costs like normal equipment. They are sunk costs. Wihtout the abilility to deduct that as an expense would absolutely KILL drilling in this country. He supports using these taxes to develop alternative energy sources, his biggest pet project being wind. LEEB wake up! The wind does not blow all the time. The sun does not shine all of the time. These are ineffcient methods for energy. Fossil fuel use is here to stay and must be a part of a reliable energy poilcy going forward. Besides how hypocritical to state on one hand that we should not be \"subsidizing\" fossil fuel usage while at the same time knowing full well that wind turbines simple don't make economic sense without federal tax breaks and subsidies.

But seeing a bit of silent film comedy on TV, he takes up the task of examining and writing a book about the work of one comedic genius from the 20\u2019s. Soon after the book is published the wife of the supposedly dead film-maker contacts Zimmer to ask if he might like to meet the man himself. There is much parallelism here, Zimmer with both Hector Mann, the ancient film-maker and Chateaubriand, the author of a lengthy autobiography that Zimmer is translating. In a way all three are dead. Zimmer and Mann had both attempted suicide. And a character in the book ultimately succeeds in such an attempt.What is real and what is illusion? Hector had been in the business of illusion, then had to present an illusion of himself for most of his life. His film The Life of Martin Frost echoes the book\u2019s theme of illusion. Sometimes an illusion can be a helpful thing, as when Zimmer is comforted by Alma on the plane (see below).There is a passage in which Mann spots what he believes to be a blue stone on the street. He has a detailed plan of what he will do with it, alive with human connection, only to find that it is a gob of spit. Yet the imagining was enough to alter his life course. Maybe illusions are what we tell ourselves, what we need, in order to survive. I enjoyed the book very much. It was a fast read, engaging, with interesting characters and enough suspense to sustain a level of tension. There was, perhaps, too little told of Hector\u2019s wife and why she does what she does. Well, Auster does explain, but I found it unconvincing. I wish that I had kept better track of characters. No, there are not hordes of them.

It was nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2004.Set in the late 1980s, the story is written from the perspective of David Zimmer, a university professor who, after losing his wife and children in a plane crash, falls into a routine of depression and isolation. After seeing one of the silent comedies of Hector Mann, an actor missing since the 1920s, he decides to occupy himself by watching all of Mann's films and writing a book about them. \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2009 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0645 \u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0631)\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u060c \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u062f\u0631 340 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789648838268\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 1391\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0645 1395\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u062f\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u062f \u0632\u06cc\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647\u061b \u0647\u0645\u0633\u0631 \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0642\u0648\u0637 \u0647\u0648\u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627 \u06a9\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u061b \u0648 \u0627\u0648 \u062f\u0686\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0631\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0633\u062a. \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u06a9\u0645\u062f\u06cc \u0635\u0627\u0645\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u0647\u06a9\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0639\u062b \u062e\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u06cc \u0627\u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0642\u062f \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u062f\u061b ...\u061b \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Paul Auster, you bastard!The man writes such depressing stuff. As with the other Auster I've read (I know I've only read 2 Austers, I am such a failure at being pretentious), I finished this and I was like... what, why did I read this?To explain myself I should say that I follow the Roger Ebert school of criticism. Roger Ebert cares more about how a movie makes him feel than on its technical merits. Granted, this is rather less valid in the medium of words on a page than the sound and fury of film, but I still stick to it. I have no problem trashing Plath's Bell-jar, regardless of its supposed literary merit or historical significance, because it bored and annoyed me.But getting to the point of this book, let me break it down for you literary thugs: there is a man whose family dies in an accident. He is depressed, but then he sees a silent comedy on TV and laughs for the first time in long while. He then decides to write about the star of this silent comedy, a man named Hector Mann. In the course of this, he finds out that Hector Mann disappeared, but he may actually still be alive!!! Stuff ensues, there are some themes brought up, there's some angst, there's some sex, you know the drill. And don't worry none of that's spoiler material, all on the first page basically.Worth reading for a few pieces of stellar writing. I was particularly impressed by how Auster writes about a film that doesn't actually exist. I bought into it, I was convinced. It's a story within a story (within a story within a story ad nauseam), and it's true that the inner stories are better told than the outer ones. I'm cool with that.In summary, though: \"Paul Auster, you bastard!\" is my review. If you likewise enjoy calling famous authors bastards, then I recommend this book to you highly.As a side note, a result of this novel, I had to add a new shelf called \"bepretentious.\" Just read some of the other, actually useful reviews and you'll see what I mean."], ["By reading this book I have become a die-hard Auster fan. The man is amazing. So clever, so imaginitive, so poetic and almost profound. This book rambles, and in doing so touches on so many intertwined narratives that one almost gives up on what was assumed to be the original plot and assumes the opening catch phrase was just another Paul Auster smoke screen story line. But this one, even in creating such an intricatedly woven network of a character experiences, never looses sight of its ultimate goal - to explain how the supposed disapearance of a silent film actor affected the life of a professor and widower from Detroit. The world created in this book is done with such care and is so full of unexpected and tangential details that I found myself wondering if I wasn't perhaps reading a work of historical fiction rather than just a plain old novel. It's an amazingly well crafted narrative, heartwrenching and hopeful at the same time. A man's life is an illusion to all except those who share in it."], ["Paul Auster obviously has a thing for men who linger between reality and nothingness. Men whose realities take a turn towards the vague, so much so, that they seem to dress themselves in the vagueness that surrounds them. Men who lose everything or men who never really had anything to begin with. Men who seem to be caught for good inside an illusion along with everyone that surrounds them. Now they\u2019re here, now they\u2019re not. There are two of those men in The Book of Illusions: the narrator and Hector Man. Bound to each other, they meet only for an hour toward the end but the echo of their meeting is present after as much as before the event.What strange time for me to read this particular book! By the end of the first chapter it had grabbed me by the neck. What\u2019s weird is that my present state has something of the book\u2019s essence. As a result, book and reality mixed in an almost hurtful way. I regret, however, that my own illusions take up much of my mental capacity nowadays, which proved unable to fully embrace this haunting novel. Not that I regret the illusions themselves. Where would the point in that be, after all?It\u2019s haunting, intense, and filled with a melancholy that sticks on your fingers with every page that you turn. There\u2019s a kind of sadness in the very idea of illusions, and Auster sure took great advantage of that. It\u2019s the idea that everything you have can disappear in the blink eye. Something precious falls into our arms and we call it a miracle. One day, we open our eyes and it\u2019s gone. Then, it\u2019s a tragedy. The worst is that, once it\u2019s gone, one can never be sure if it was ever even there.Don\u2019t be fooled, The Book of Illusions is so much more than my clouded mind can produce right now.

This famous question is closely examined in \"The Book of Illusions,\" by author Paul Auster, as he tells the story of literature professor David Zimmer, who copes with the death of his wife and two sons by shutting out the real world so that he can inhabit the \"silent world of Hector Mann,\" an obscure actor from the 1920s. After leaving a dozen movies behind that nobody seems to know about, Hector disappeared in 1929, presumed dead. However, it turns out he is actually alive in New Mexico, paying penance for the role he played in the accidental death of his girlfriend \u2013 vowing never to make another movie and eventually only agreeing to make movies if they will be destroyed immediately upon his death and never be seen by an audience. According to Hector\u2019s rationale, if he makes a movie and nobody sees it, then his movie does not exist. But is this true? Does an idea have to be shared \u2013 and experienced by others \u2013 to exist and take on meaning? Although he provides confusing answers throughout the work, first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others.At first, Auster suggests Hector can attain greatness on his own, even without an audience. When Hector Mann disappears, his film career is pretty much over due to the invention of sound in movies and his heavy accent. His last major film, \"Mr. Nobody,\" is a response to the frustration he feels about his career, as, in the film, his character takes a magic potion that makes him invisible. Eventually, he is reborn as a new person, and, facing himself in the mirror, he confronts the fact of his own annihilation with an exuberant smile \u2013 the last image of Hector Mann that will be seen by audiences, seemingly content with the idea he is \"no longer the Hector Mann who has amused us and entertained us.\" Similarly, in his own life, Hector is forced to disappear after his girlfriend is killed, and, to disguise himself, he loses his trademark mustache, so that he is \"the spitting image of Mr. Nothing himself.\" In his new life, Hector no longer makes movies, but instead works odd jobs and focuses on reading, writing, learning English, and planting trees. In his journals, Hector writes, \"I talk only to the dead now. They are the only ones I trust, the only ones who understand me.\" Hector no longer shares himself with an audience \u2013 Hector Mann has been annihilated \u2013 but, according to his biographer and friend Alma, he is closer to greatness than ever before: \"[T]he further he traveled from his point of origin, she said, the closer he came to achieving greatness. [. . . ]Even now, he still talks about the trees as his greatest accomplishment. Better than his films, she says, better than anything else he\u2019s ever done.\" In this reading of Hector\u2019s life, based on the interpretation of \"Mr. Nobody,\" Hector is the only voice that matters; even without an audience, he can still attain greatness.However, a later film, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost,\" questions this notion that artists can attain greatness without sharing their work with others. In this movie, which Hector made after his disappearance with the promise it would never be released to an audience, is different from his earlier work: it is serious, not a comedy, and Hector does not act in it. In the movie, Martin Frost, a writer, must destroy his work to save the life of his girlfriend Claire. After she is brought back to life and realizes what has happened, she erupts in tears, asking Martin if he realizes what\u2019s he done and desperately wondering what they are going to do now. The movie ends ambiguously with her questions and no answers from Martin. Similarly, after Hector\u2019s death, his wife Frieda destroys everything \u2013 his movies, his journals, and even the manuscript of a biography his friend Alma had been working on for seven years \u2013 in a \"precise reenactment of the final scene of Martin Frost.\" Pondering Frieda\u2019s actions, David thinks about Hector\u2019s sacrifice of \"the one thing that would have given his work meaning \u2013 the pleasure of sharing it with others,\" but then realizes that, in Frieda\u2019s mind, \"It was about making something in order to destroy it. That was the work, and until all evidence of the work had been destroyed, the work would not exist. It would come into being only at the moment of its annihilation.\" In Frieda\u2019s interpretation, work was not created for others; in fact, sharing Hector\u2019s work with others would cause it to lose its meaning. However, ultimately, both of Auster\u2019s protagonists \u2013 David Zimmer and Hector Mann \u2013 seem to repudiate Frieda and believe that Hector\u2019s work does not lose meaning if it is shared with others. When Alma had first told David about her biography of Hector, he was initially skeptical: \"It\u2019s one thing to unburden himself to you, but a book is for the world, and as soon as he tells his story to the world, his life becomes meaningless.\" In other words, a book exists not for the author or subject but for readers, and by sharing himself with them, Hector could lose himself. He would exist as they saw him, and not as he really was \u2013 their illusions of him would become reality. When David questions Hector about why he would want to give himself away like that, Hector answers, \"Why should it bother me to turn myself into an example for others? [. . . .] You laughed, Zimmer. Perhaps others will begin to laugh with you.\" These words \u2013 the last Hector speaks in the book \u2013 show his realization of the positive impact his work can have on others, as he comes to the conclusion that his earlier films, if they made David laugh, were \"perhaps the greatest good\" he had done. David ultimately seems to embrace Hector\u2019s viewpoint, hoping that others will laugh with him, as he takes pleasure when Hector\u2019s silent comedies are put out on video and becomes an honorary member of a fan club, the International Brotherhood of Hector Manniacs. Most of all, he hopes that someday the lost films of Hector Mann \u2013 the ones that Frieda destroyed \u2013 will be found somehow so others can enjoy them like he did, \"and the story will start all over again. I live with that hope.\" In order to have meaning, Hector\u2019s films must be shared with others. Unlike Frieda, David believes that Hector\u2019s films should be shared with the world. Although he provides confusing answers throughout \"The Book of Illusions,\" first suggesting that Hector\u2019s greatness can be achieved on his own, ultimately Auster seems to conclude that Hector\u2019s works only become important when they are shared and experienced by others. Like the confusing answers to the question of the movie that nobody sees, \"The Book of Illusions\" is full of other confusing themes and contradictions. For example, one major theme of the book is the effect of chance and how small circumstances can have a significant impact on our lives. However, while there are some small circumstances which impact the action in the book, for the most part, the major events are more like contrived and implausible plot devices \u2013 an ex-girlfriend killed by a current girlfriend, a wife and two sons lost in a plane crash, David held at gunpoint so that he will watch a movie, a tough fall resulting in another death, a suicide, a possible murder. Are these really \"small circumstances\" of chance? Moreover, while this issue of fate is explored in depth like the meaning of one\u2019s work, the two themes are never tied together. In Auster\u2019s telling, both Hector and David cope with loss by turning to art but they are not reborn again except through accidents of fate, so that the one seemingly resolved idea in the book \u2013 the issue of the movie nobody hears \u2013 becomes irrelevant compared to the greater themes of fate and rebirth. The interplay between the various themes is never explored, and it is easy to get confused as all of these ideas are presented, but are often contradicted and never fully resolved, leading a reader to ponder the 2001 Atlantic Monthly article\u2019s criticism of Paul Auster: \"[He] knows the prime rule of pseudo-intellectual writing: the harder it is to be pinned down on any idea, the easier it is to conceal that one has no ideas at all.\" In light of the questions asked in \"The Book of Illusions,\" it is easy to wonder: if an author throws out a lot of different ideas but never resolves them, so that readers can\u2019t understand what those ideas are, do the ideas actually exist?"], ["David Zimmer is a teacher and writer whose wife and two young sons have been killed in an aeroplane crash. At his lowest ebb, suicidal and alcoholic, David sees a silent film on television and laughs for the first time since the tragedy. Thereafter, he develops a fascination with the actor featured in the old movie, Hector Mann - a minor star of silent comedies who vanished in 1929 and was never seen or heard of again. Travelling around the world in order to visit the film archives containing Hector's few movies, David channels his obsession into a book about the actor's work. However, the story really begins some time after this, when David receives a mysterious letter containing some startling news about Hector.The Book of Illusions displays many characteristics of Auster's typical style, most noticeably the constant presence of symbolism, the perceived significance of art and the line between reality and (as the title suggests) illusion. Here, rather than the emphasis being on language and writing, the focus is on Hector's films and their visual impact, though of course the power of storytelling is still key. When David discovers that Hector made some films that were never seen by anyone else, he questions whether art has any importance if it is not shared with and experienced by an audience. David's ruminations are mirrored in various ways throughout the narrative - David withdraws from life, shuts himself away and becomes invisible, so it seems ironic that he becomes obsessed with a silent movie star; Hector makes a film called 'Mr. Nobody' in which he literally becomes invisible, and then, in his real life, he disappears; another character, Alma, is made more visible by a large birthmark on her face, yet she feels this gives her the ability to instantly see others' true characters through their reactions to her appearance.There are elements of the story that are, from a distance, completely implausible. The manner of David and Alma's first meeting is really quite ridiculous, and certainly unbelievable, as is the speedy development of their relationship. But I think this is where the genius of Auster's writing really lies, in suspending the reader's disbelief and immersing you so deeply into the story that these strange events seem believable. I can imagine that the book won't work for everyone - some may find the lengthy descriptions of unseen, nonexistent films dull (I really enjoyed them), and there's a curious... quietness about it all - a very subdued feel. This is not a deeply thrilling novel, more of a restrained but haunting little tale. On balance I think I personally prefer Oracle Night, but there is plenty to recommend this story, especially for fans of the author. (If you're not already acquainted with Auster, I'd still recommend The New York Trilogy as a primer.)"], ["\u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03cd\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b6\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 True Detective: \"To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing.

Though by no means impenetrable, the novel is daunting enough to merit a list of tips for those wishing to tackle it for the first time. Below is my advice on how new readers can get over the hump. Trust me, it's a small hump, and the masterpiece that lies on the other side is worth the effort.1. Read V first ... Pynchon's V is shorter and more accessible than Gravity's Rainbow, but addresses the same themes in a similar style. If you enjoyed V, you will have built up a reserve of goodwill for Pynchon that will carry you through the initial rough patches of Gravity's Rainbow. This advice was given to me years ago, and I'm glad I took it.2. Accept that you won't understand everything...Don't be concerned if you can't follow the many digressions or keep track of every minor character that pops up. As with other famously difficult novels, Gravity's Rainbow's real payoff comes in the rereading, so you shouldn't feel obliged to linger over each passage until it makes sense. Pynchon isn't trying to lord it over you by writing a book this dense; it's just his way of giving you your money's worth. Just follow what you can the first time through, which fortunately is a lot.3. Accentuate the accessible...Gravity's Rainbow's unreadability is over-hyped. Yes, there are many jarring digressions, but threading through them is a fairly conventional detective story. Sure there are lyrical passages that take off for the stratosphere, but they are grace notes in a melody of otherwise breezy narrative prose. So on your first time through, it's enough to follow the main plot (will Slothrop find the mysterious Rocket 00000?) and enjoy Pynchon's jokes, which are laugh-out-loud funny.4. Don't give up too early...I don't want to say that Gravity's Rainbow gets off to a slow start, but it has a lot of scene-setting to do, and the engine that really drives the book along only gets revved up in part 2. Part 1 is a well-executed minor key portrait of wartime London, but part 2 is where the drugs kick in, so stick with the novel at least that far."], ["THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A MAN IN WW2 HE GETS ERECTIONS."], ["\u2018What is the real nature of control?\u2019\tFrom the first sentence of Pynchon\u2019s National Book Award winning novel, Gravity\u2019s Rainbow, the Reader is transplanted into a threatening world where death strikes first, the cause second. It is a world of frightening realism and comic absurdity, all fueled through drug induced hallucinations, paranoid ramblings, and psychological investigations that is not all that unlike our own reality once you remove yourself to view it from afar as if it were some painting in a gallery. This is the Zone, and Pynchon is your field guide through the wasteland of paranoids, preterits and pornographers. The novel is stylistically staggering and so carefully researched that the line between fact and fiction blurs and is not always easy to deduce. It is carefully plotted out with extreme precision, aligning the events with actual weather detail from the days played out and in keeping with a metaphoric representation of the zodiac signs through the passing months. While this novel can be demanding, it is also extremely rewarding for those who make it through this wild rocket ride of literature.\tA first time Reader should be cautioned that Part 1 of this mammoth text is exceedingly difficult. Pynchon seemingly takes great joy in pummeling the Reader with a labyrinthine structure of characters and plot lines, each accruing through dramatic left turns in the narrative. The effect is pure disorientation, obfuscation and outright frustration. It feels just like spinning plates. It is, in a sense, Pynchon\u2019s boot camp for the real war awaiting across minefields of prose; it is where he must break you down and reconstruct you as he sees fit. While the Reader must keep their head down and gut through, soaking up as much of the swirling stories as they can, Pynchon lays out the groundwork for the larger themes to come. Many of the ideas expressed early on won\u2019t seem particularly meaningful, but by the end of the novel the Reader will realize it was all right there in their faces from the start. As characters will come and go like ghosts, with only minimal dimension and reference to them, the Reader will begin to realize that the coming tribulations are not there for the growth of the characters, but for the Reader themselves. The Reader must come out the other side changed in order for the novel to be a success. They must let go of their notions of story and plot, for Pynchon views even the smallest plot structure as comfort, they must let go, give in, and submit to Pynchon. He demands it, and he will fire off heady diatribes against your intellect with philosophy, theology, conspiracies and actual rocket science.\tThe novel takes off running once the gun sounds the start of Part 2 when, dropped from foggy London town, the Reader finds themselves in the Zone. Early on is a discussion of Pointsman and Mexico, Pointsman being crafted as the ultimate embodiment of Pavlov\u2019s cause-and-effect conditioning and Mexico being considered as \u2018the Antipointsman\u2019.\u2019The young statistician is devoted to number and method, not table-rapping or wishful thinking. But in the domain of zero to one, not-something to something. Pointsman can only possess the zero and the one. He cannot, like Mexico, survive anyplace in between\u2026. to Mexico belongs the domain between zero and one \u2013 the middle Pointsman has excluded from his persuasion \u2013 the probabilities.\u2019Much of this novel deals with these two major perspectives. Pynchon often establishes structure, the Pointsman method, merely to deconstruct it and show the faults that lie within. By showing two specific points, in this instance excluding those inbetween points, Pynchon is able to demonstrate moments of symmetry, which he will then reverse. Normally a rocket would be heard before it explodes in a ball of death, but with the V2, now we have the death before sound (reversals also play a large key to the novel, from the countdown before a launch, to hypnotic imagery of English explorers sailing backwards to home). \tThese two specific points are also expressed as binary differences, such as black and white, life and death, good and evil, preterition and the chosen few. These binaries are clear-cut sides, direct opposites of forces in keeping with the theory of entropy which rules the novel, sides that we clamor to reach in order to have a firm ground to stand on and a cut-and-dry vision of who is friend and who is foe. But Mexico, and Pynchon, rejects these binaries. Mexico acknowledges the space between zero and one, which is a wild, lawless no-man\u2019s land (recall the McCarthy-esk western vision of Slothrops where there is one of everything \u2013 a endlessly compounding \u2018one\u2019 that creates an asymptote never actually reaching 1) where everything and anything is possible. It is a place more dream than reality, and the hallucinogenic nature of Pynchon\u2019s spiraling prose and plots do well to express the ambiguities inherent in such a Zone. However, the novel never fully subscribes to one theory and can be interpreted as a cautionary tale for those who wander into this territory. Plot, laws and binaries are structures that keep our minds at ease and provide comfort and safety, so when we enter into the infinite freedom of the decimal we open ourselves to forces that may scatter us, kill us, and rub us out into oblivion.\tPynchon himself will try to scatter and thwart the Reader in consequence of stepping into his Zone. He acknowledges you are in his territory, and will speak as he chooses, often with what seems an intention of belittling your own intelligence. He only occasionally makes concessions to the reader when he realizes at least a slight bridge must be made in setting a scene such as saying \u2018you will want cause and effect. All right\u2019, which, considering the rejection of such an idea in this novel, serves to mock the reader for scrambling to grasp the reassuring ledge of the pool in this deep end he has thrown us. To swallow this novel on a first read, a reader must attack it somewhat like middle school mathematical story problems \u2013 find the important information in the bloated paragraph, divide and conquer. There is a plethora of information to choose from as he will offer a vast variety of the same symbols and metaphors (the S, for example, shows up as the SS, the shape of the bomb factory tunnels, people spooning, the symbol for entropy, etc. There is a death/life metaphor on practically every page) Yet, Pynchon seems hell-bent on keeping you on your toes and disoriented. He will allow the Reader to slide into a groove of strong forward velocity, and then deliver a scene so grotesquely funny or vilely disgusting to shock the readers mind and scatter their thoughts and perceptions from decoding this vast network of ideas and then tries to evade us in a web of looping plots, obtuse anecdotes and countless characters (some of which come and go with hundreds of pages between mention). The maze of a plot that must be navigated is acknowledged as being similar to the course of events Slothrop encounters on the way, which he compares to the MBTA: \u2018by riding each branch the proper distance, knowing when to transfer, keeping some state of minimum grace though it might often look like he\u2019s headed the wrong way, this network of all plots may yet carry him to freedom.\u2019 There must be a sense of trust that eventually, if you keep gutting through, there will be a conclusion to satisfy a journey of such magnitude.\tThere is a constant paranoia overwhelming each printed word, a paranoia that the Reader must assimilate by proxy in order to fully appreciate the madness at hand. Yet paranoia itself must be a sort of comfort as well. While there is a fear of the Invisible Hand at play, pushing us through psychological nods in the right way, it is still a comfort that we are part of Their greater plan. For the preterits, this They is the only sense of God they will ever feel, as they are looked over by God himself. This whole novel is the interaction of such Preterits, from the fetishists to the colony of escaped concentration camp members, and the Reader must become a member of these second sheep as they must lose their selves along with Slothrop. The Reader is dragged through the mud and muck of a smattering of various theories, and to keep their sanity, they attempt to assign meaning to these elusive threads flashing about them in order to keep going. But perhaps this is just what Pynchon wants us to do, assigning Him the role of the They, and the Reader will begin to feel paranoid that this is all in jest, that Pynchon is simply pulling the world over their eyes and will begin to question even their own powers of deduction. We have learned that all that is comforting must be released (not yet knowing at these points in the novel that there is only a void awaiting with total freedom), and even the paranoid ponderings are only a comfort for us in Pynchon\u2019s world. If there is something comforting \u2013 religious, if you want, about paranoia, there is still also anti-paranoia, where nothing is connected to anything, a condition not many of us can bear for long. Well right now, Slothrop feels himself sliding onto the anti-paranoid part of his cycle, feels the whole city around him going back roofless, vulnerable, uncentered as he is, and only pasteboard images now of the Listening Enemy left between him and the wet sky\u2019 First, note the reversals in this, then swoon at the powerful prose in the second half. Now, assign meaning to this quote \u2013 but Slap, no! \u2013 Pynchon says there is no meaning. But then feel yourself become transparent and weightless, fading into oblivion with no reference to the world around you. This is the ultimate dilemma we are faced with in the Zone.\tIt is no surprise the Reader is made to feel so paranoid in a novel rife with corporate conspiracy, much of which is highly researched and forms an impressive historical fiction aspect to this novel. If those rambling through the Zone are the preterits moved by the They, than these corporations are one of the highest tangible link to They we can see. They decide who lives and dies, who is rich and who is denied wealth, what we want to consume and how (\u2018consumers need to feel a sense of sin\u2019) and exist in a realm where the War is simply a shuffling of power. \u2018This war was never political at all, the politics was all theater, all just to keep the people distracted\u2026secretly it was being dictated instead by the needs of technology\u2026.by a conspiracy between human beings and techniques\u2019. Throughout the course of Gravity\u2019s Rainbow, we have endless looks into mans thirst for technology, which in itself is a thirst for death based on the nature of the technology, even when it is also a life-giving force such as is the case of Pokler who had no life until the Rocket, and how this goes beyond the War itself. Even the White Visitation simply uses the War as a reason for more funding. Mans role in technology is at the heart of every idea in this book. Entropy is a measuring stick which this novel employs (in a book that sets out to dissolve all rules, having a rule that is upheld highlights its importance), and all events and ideas serve to counterbalance each other in keeping with the conservation of energy with the preterits being the heat burned off. As a quick aside, if I may, many of these preterits, Mexico and Jessica\u2019s romance or the concentration camp members (\u2018their liberation was a banishment\u2019) for example, are directly tied to the war and a become casualty of peace \u2013 the budding romance (there are some tearjerker lines, Pynchon really shows his soft side with them) being the \u2018waste heat\u2019 in a chemical reaction. They Rockets, being the focal point of the book, are both life and death images as well as phallic metaphors while many of the phalluses are rocket metaphors. Film plays another large role, with much of the book containing constant allusion to pop culture similar to a Quentin Tarantino film, and Der Springer believes he can reshape reality through film.\tThis struggle of life and death is something that must be embraced as two parts of a whole in this novel, much like man and machine become one with Gottfried and the 00000 Rocket. Life and death are found strung together all throughout the novel, yet, as critic Harold Bloom points out in his essays on Rainbow, in Pynchon's book so focused on the idea of Death, the Reader never actually experiences or witnesses one - not one in all of the 800 pages. Many deaths are spoken of, some ambiguous like Tantivity\u2019s, and others referred to plainly such as Pudding\u2019s (note that \u2018shit\u2019 is spoken of as a metaphor for death, \u2018shit is the presence of death\u2019, and he is made to ingest it during \u2013 for him, not us \u2013 a sexual peak as another way life and death bind together in the novel), but the camera of the prose, if you will, always cuts right before the Reader must be an active participant in the death. Like Gottfried again, we know he dies, but because the com-link is only one way, we never can know the precise moment. Even Peter\u2019s clubbing to the head cuts before the club can land. In this way, the novel is shown actually as a celebration of life, all the moments moving from 1:life to 0:death but never getting to the zero. We are forever in the Zone, for better or for worse. But with the final words of the novel, nay, the final two words, he pulls us from oblivion back to the whole. We escape death by existing in the moments between 1 and 0, and, ironically, in a book bent on annihilating structure and group alignment, he calls us all back into one large group: humanity.Gravity\u2019s Rainbow is a massive novel that takes quite a bit of decoding and deboning in order to devour. But this is precisely what Pynchon wants and requires of us. This is a book that more or less requires a second reading just to grasp all that it has to say, the first is just a test of survival. The agglomeration of ideas are too much to chew and savor on one trip, and there is so much ambiguity present that, like Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, he intends to scholars to dissect and analyze this novel for years and years to come. In the novel, the Zone members gather to become Kabbalists of the Rocket, \u2018to be scholar-magicians of the Zone, with somewhere in it a Text, to be picked to pieces, annotated, explicated, and masturbated till it\u2019s all squeezed limp of its last drop\u2019. This book is Pynchon\u2019s Rocket, \u2018our Torah\u2026our darkness\u2019, which he cast forth into the 1970\u2019s literary scene as a harbinger of destruction to all preconceived notions of literature. Pynchon in this way is not all that unlike the Rocket launchers, hidden far away out of sight in his reclusiveness, avoiding photographic surveillance, sending his Rocket into a brave new world. We, the Readers, are Gottfried strapped inside with \u2018fire beneath our feet\u2019 as Pynchon, as Blicero, hurls us forth into the irreversible future.Now everybody-00001/00001'Each bird has his branch now, and each one is the Zone' roll creditsI would also HIGHLY recommend the A Gravity's Rainbow Companion: Sources and Contexts for Pynchon's Novel to any readers of this novel. It was a huge help, especially with the pop culture allusions. Just be wary that it does occasionally give away plot elements and devices, sometimes long before they appear in the novel, and will practically double your time reading the actual book because there is so much information.Also, I have to thank Stephen M's wonderful group read for inspiring me to read the book, while doubling as a support group to get us all through this tome! The discussions and links there are extremely helpful and insightful.Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to direct you to the amazing reviews of my reading buddies on this strange ride, Steve, Ian, Jenn, Mark,Shan, Sean,  Paquita, and many more to come!"], ["It took three months, but I finally pinned this sucker down to the count of ten. Three months is kinda perfect if you think about it, though. That's my typical honeymoon period in most relationships, the enthusiastic \"I can still more than tolerate you\" part, so great timing, yeah? Sure, I cheated on him on about 15 separate occasions in that time-frame, but hell, nobody's perfect. The library card in my wallet is like a condom just begging to be used.So yeah, I can now say I've \"read\" this book. Oh, and you know what else? So. Fucking. What. What Pynchon has created here is like a goddamned kaleidoscope; every time you look in, you're going to see something else. It will give it up and give it up and then beg for some more. All it takes is a minor flip of the wrist and BOOM! An all-new explosion of madness. Oh, come on, I fucking dare you to read this book and not make a single sexual reference while reviewing it. Shiny steel. Roaring rocket. Skat, skat. Boom!You finish, and you say \"Okay. Now that the hard part's over (heh), now I can go back and actually read this thing. You know, after I practice a few more times by reading this thing.\" The strange bit of all that is it doesn't feel like a cross to bear. I want to read it again. You know, over about a year, sipping it slowly like, I dunno, something fancy that people drink slowly because it's fancy. If Pynchon's not sucking you down a black hole of sonic prose, snake-charming you all woozy with pages upon pages of seriously some of the most gorgeous, sprawling shit you will ever read, then he's grabbing your hand and skipping you along the Land of Oz while feeding you poppers and whippits and champagne, all while conducting a symphony of melancholy deceptively presented as a cheeky musical in your mind with an ensemble cast who are all candy-flipping and drunk. More often than not, he manages as much all at once while also making you laugh so hard, actually out loud, that you get funny looks from strangers and maybe even shoot a little snot from one nostril. Embarrassing. There's no place like Oz, there's no place like Oz, there's no place like Oz...Two things: First, a warning. Don't read this in public. You will be reading about shit entering a mouth as you wait in the lobby of an auto shop for your oil to get changed, all while America's Funniest Home Videos plays in the background and an angel-blonde little girl is staring at you blankly while pulling her lower lip into strange shapes; you will be having your blood drawn and turning your ereader* away from the nurse's all-too-nearby eyes because just like when mom and dad came in during the worst scenes of whatever movies you watched as a teen, you are of course reading the part where a case of mistaken identity ends in an oopsy-doopsy orchiectomy, just after the part where that guy was having sex with that prostitute while calling her by racial slurs as she planned her grocery list in her head, eyes dead and distant. High potentiality for awkward moments with snoopy strangers, trust me. Second thing: About that *, my roommate has finally beat this old purist into submission with an ereader. As my book continued to disintegrate, she took advantage of this opportunity to come out victorious in her long-standing campaign to convert me to digibooks, and downloaded this novel, went to the page I was on, and sat it in my lap. As we were in the middle of a move and my book was in pieces in various boxes in the back of my car for ten days, I couldn't exactly say no. I suppose it's high time that I admit the damned thing is pretty convenient. Dammit. Moving on then, I read from the reader when out of the house, and tore up my hard copy at home. I will continue to graffiti the latter during future re-readings. Here is what is left after a first pass:\nI only hit you because I love you, book. Point being, ignore the haters, and stop being such a sissy. Dive, baby, dive. The water's good. Or do you just hate swimming? And Christmas? And puppies? \n\n\nOriginal \"review\" so the comment thread will continue to make sense: My copy is so old and poorly constructed that the glue can't hold the weight, and the pages are falling out like baby teeth as I turn them, so much so that I keep finding myself holding a sheet of paper in my hand like it's parchment in order to read the left side text of the novel. Somehow this strange reading method, the literal breaking apart of the story as I move through it, seems appropriate. Also, the spine itself has fault lines indicating a future separation of the physical book into 4 large chunks, which is even better, really. I should probably buy some duct tape, though, or this could get confusing. The cover says this book cost its original owner 4 dollars and ninety-five cents. Can you even get a kindle short story for that these days?"], ["~~I don\u2019t know why exactly you folks out there read, or why you feel compelled to then seek out a community in which you might share your thoughts, impressions, reactions etc. about the books you\u2019ve read\u2026 But me myself, I read for many reasons - among them the opportunity to transcend the narrow window of my own point of view; the chance to learn by a leap, however minimally, over the subjective walls of my own stupid existence; also and especially to inhabit for a few moments the warm pulse of aesthetic bliss and recognition that waves over me whenever a certain sentence or passage hits just so\u2026; at a basic level, to increase my appreciation and understanding of Life, and those artists and thinkers out there striving to contribute to the meaning of human experience, those attempting to bring some beauty or order into the entropic universe and make a little sense out of this mess of a reality we\u2019re stuck in for the duration. And if they can\u2019t find order or beauty, at least to make the muck sing out in some delightful way... There is also that moment where something unnameable (but now somehow named...) clicks into place while reading, and something akin to deja vu blooms inside - the This is the proper expression of the thing I\u2019ve always had in mind but have never been able to express so rightly... The closest thing I get to what is typically described as a feeling of \u201cspirituality\u201d (I who sincerely believe I do not experience spirituality in any degree), are these moments when I come upon this expression of something intensely meaningful and resonant with me and my personal experiences outside of myself, encountering something that seems of me but not by me... these are elusive moments, rare, but when they occur I feel struck by something close to what Nabokov wrote about his experience of Love :\u201dWhen that slow-motion, silent explosion of love takes place in me, unfolding its melting fringes and overwhelming me with the sense of something much vaster, much more enduring and powerful than the accumulation of matter or energy in any imaginable cosmos, then my mind cannot but pinch itself to see if it is really awake. I have to make a rapid inventory of the universe, just as a man in a dream tries to condone the absurdity of his position by making sure he is dreaming. I have to have all space and all time participate in my emotion, in my mortal love, so that the edge of its mortality is taken off, thus helping me to fight the utter degradation, ridicule, and horror of having developed an infinity of sensation and thought within a finite existence.\u201dWhich is why, of course, I then tend to seek out a community with which to share my emotion, my experience, to know that others too might be aware that such experiences are not only possible, but are out there for us, somewhere, waiting to be found hidden among the vast mundane plowing of life\u2026 and the comforting idea that others have generously spent many of their precious hours alive in creating works of art that contain their own such revelations, because they understand the importance of keeping this type of transmission alive through history, that this type of uncovering and finding is an essential component of being human ... CUE SONG ~~ Take a look! It\u2019s in a book! A reading rainbow... ~~So, here I am, putting it out there to this broad community of Good Readers, wanting to tell you, Gravity\u2019s Rainbow, for me, was one such experience, one such \u201cfinding\u201d, a book I\u2019ve been waiting for all my reading life\u2026 And with it, and my readings of Mason & Dixon and Against The Day, I am more certain of my notion that Pynchon is the peak of American postmodernism, alongside the works of William Gaddis - that these two have set the goal for what the encyclopedic novel might accomplish on this side of the Atlantic, in this American English\u2026 I consider having the opportunity to read both Gravity\u2019s Rainbow and Gaddis\u2019 J R in the same year a great privilege...But Pynchon\u2019s book itself is practically impossible to review, impossible to summarize or condense, worthless to categorize or constrain by exegesis - because of all it contains, the enormity of what it holds within its pages, the hundreds of characters and mad proliferation of ideas and allusions, all those words! hundreds of thousands of words that somehow leave so much unsaid, but unsaid in perfect ways (left to drift into audience dreams) - because it projects countless tentacles wrapping its world and reaching out into space-time, some of which return full of Story and the Known to feed the octopus body center of narrative, and some which purposefully throw Story and the Known out into the careening forces of the expanding universe, to be forever unresolved and scattered to cosmic coldness and star-distances - because of the density of the fragmentation of the world it has created, (but which is no more fragmented than any human consciousness encountering existence on any given day)... So allow me only to give you a small cenotaph or a monument - (an obelisk?)- to the impossible review of Gravity\u2019s Rainbow :: Like a great movie, all of its themes are present in each scene, and yet the individual occurrences and set pieces here seem infinitely varied and inexhaustible. It is the macro-microcosm unity of the mandala.

So much so that he fell silent for about 14 years after writing it (leading me to wonder if DeLillo was spoofing him in Mao II). It is an amazing book and the first Pynchon I ever read. It is a rude introduction to his style though as it is thoroughly post modern in narration, manipulation of time and reality, and proliferation of characters. There are moments of pure genius but also of repulsion (leading him to lose the Pulitzer the year it was published), but even those moments are perfectly in harmony with the characters they are associated with, the massive condemnation of anti-Semitism and Nazism (I have to believe that despite his silence, Pynchon has to be anti-Trump) and all forms of repression and censorship. It is the story of a journey across a no mans land (like many of Cormac McCarthy's books) full of violence and anarchy as the war is over but boundaries and frontiers (between countries, reality and non-reality, good and evil, acceptable and reprehensible) are blurred and the hero must make this journey with or without a conclusion. I will stick to my no spoilers policy and avoid discussing the plot, but highly recommend this masterpiece, but perhaps one should start with an \"easier\" Pynchon like Inherent Vice or The Crying of Lot 49 to get their feet wet first because I would hate to see you missing out of this from feeling out of your depth if you can't find your pace in it.The political message of the book is still relevant: war is fucking hell and the aftermath is just as bad. It is also a book that you can re-read and discover things you may have missed the first time around - in particular the elliptical structure which explains the word \"rainbow\" in the title. It is grotesque and raw and superbly written. I have been told in the comments that the Companion by Weisenburger is excellent - I'll use it when I reread GR!"], ["Prologue\"A screaming comes across the sky. It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now.\"GenesisIn the beginning was the earth, and above the earth was the sky. The earth consisted of land and water. The sky consisted of air, the moon, the sun and the stars in the heavens.The land consisted of rock. Water was everywhere, but still precious.The sky was light by day and dark by night. By day, the light came from the sun and sometimes the moon. At night, a lesser light came from the stars and the moon.On the land, things were still, but then they began to change. The sun made rock hot by day and the night made it cold, and the rock became stone, and the stone soon became soil.The Creation of LifeIn time, the soil and the water came together with the air and the sunlight to form life.The life was green and did cling to the soil.The air and the heavens were the realm of gravity.Everything on earth was made to fall and to disperse and to dissipate as time goes by. To rise was to challenge the laws of nature. Nothing could rise, except one thing, invisibly, vapors.Water mixed with the heat of the sun and became a vapor, and the vapor ascended to the sky and became clouds. At night and sometimes by day, the clouds became rain, and the rain fell and spilled water onto the earth.Some water remained on the land in rivers and streams and lakes. Other water, sliding and falling and dropping across the land, found its way to the oceans.The Life of FruitIn time, life conspired to defy gravity little by little.Life combined with the soil and the water and the air and the light to make trees and shrubs (some bearing bananas or mangoes or pawpaws), and these plants reached skyward to the sun.But these plants could not be severed from the soil, because their roots sought nourishment there. Any plant severed from the soil would fall to the earth, obedient to gravity.In time, many plants were severed from the earth and covered by soil and water and became hard and part of the rock. Beneath the surface of the earth, dead plants formed coal, and sometimes oil and gas.The Origin of ManAfter much time, other forms of life were born, including animals that did grow heads and arms and legs and tails and eat the plants.Some animals became humans, some male, some female, all of whom wished to walk on two legs and become higher than other animals and plants.Men were not always bigger and stronger than other animals and so sought refuge in holes in the ground and caves.The caves were darker than night and men grew frightened of the dark, not knowing what was out there, until they discovered fire, which they used for light and heat.Sometimes, men used fire to warm the flesh of other beasts and they grew stronger.Life was good, and men tended to live within and surrounded by nature as one.Man on the MoveMen began to move across the earth in search of food and learned how to construct homes of rock and stone and bricks made of soil and water.Their homes grew taller than trees and animals and began to defy gravity.Then men learned how to make machines that could move across the land and water at speeds faster than men or horses could walk or run.And they consumed coal and oil and gas, so that they were not dependent on horse power.Man Turns the Power Switch OnMen learned how to make electricity and switches that would turn the power on and off.Men made glass bulbs that turned darkness into light.Men had finally become enlightened.Men looked at the sky for beauty and meaning and portents of the future. They wondered what lived in the heavens and whether they had been created by gods.They made drawings and pictures of what surrounded them. One day they would make photographs and moving pictures and shiny silver discs.Men observed what occurred in nature and, over a great duration, started to learn about cause and effect.Man Dominates HimselfThen men created gods in their own image. They invented religions and superstitions and sometimes it was difficult to tell them apart, men and their gods, religions and superstitions.Men used their religions to explain what they could and couldn\u2019t do.Then they created churches and holy men and scriptures to dictate to them what they must and must not do, and the holy men and their gods punished them if they did not do what they must do, or did what they must not do. Man Discovers Matters of Life and DeathMen observed decay and destruction and death around them, and wondered whether they too would die one day.Men didn\u2019t like this prospect and decided that they alone amongst the plants and animals had a soul and, after death, would live in eternity.Except that, if they disobeyed the commandments of their holy men and gods and scriptures, they would be punished by eternal damnation and made to live in hell. Which was not meant to be a good thing.Some scientists conducted experiments and tests on dogs and other animals and learned how they were governed by stimulus and response.Men wondered whether their souls and their capacity for reason elevated them above the animals.They did not recognise that, even with their gods, men would do evil things to each other that animals would never do.Man Engages in Some Empire State BuildingMen built their homes in cities and formed nations. They conquered other cities and nations and established empires.They established workforces and armies.They organised men and their possessions into rows and columns, and they made men and women wear uniforms, so that they might look and think and do alike.They developed systems to punish those who would dissent and they used force to hold their empires together.They looked down upon any man or woman who would not conform or wear a uniform.Those that they did not incarcerate or hang or inject with life-sapping solutions or electricity, they cast off into the wilderness, where they would disperse or die of thirst.We Men are ScientistsSo men acquired knowledge and wisdom, and accumulated science and technology beyond the wildest dreams of their predecessors.They converted their knowledge and wisdom into zeroes and ones, so that they might store them on silver discs.Some men wondered whether there was more to life than zeroes and ones, and was there anything beyond zero or between zero and one, and they were scorned.Man Defies GravitySlowly, man\u2019s dreams became more ambitious.Some men dreamed about how they might fly like a bird, and one day men learned how to make flying machines.Men did not always live happily with other men, and they made tools and machines that would maim and kill their enemies.Men used their aeroplanes to drop bombs on other men, and the planes and the bombs grew bigger, and the maiming and the killing grew more widespread and efficient.At the same time, men learned how to make bigger and taller buildings that reached higher and appeared to touch the sky.Many men lived and worked in these skyscrapers.In Case of WarThen there were two wars between many nations of the world.In the first war, many men died in trenches dug into the soil of their farms.In the second war, it was not necessary to get into a trench to die. Many people died in their homes and their buildings. It was easier to kill more quickly in the cities that housed large numbers of people.Men made new bombs that were meant to end the wars, but when they continued, men invented rockets that could maim and kill even greater numbers of people.Some rockets made a sound that warned people that they were coming.If you heard the sound, you might be able to escape to safety.When they did not end the war, scientists invented more and better ways to kill more and better people. They built rockets that made no noise and could kill you before you heard them coming.They were the perfect machinery of death, because nowhere was safe and you could not escape them. These rockets defied both gravity and the imagination.While nobody had been looking or thinking about it, man\u2019s buildings and vehicles and aeroplanes and rockets and bombs had made the earth dark again.A Voice in the WildernessWell, maybe not nobody. A man called Slothrop had been watching.Every time a rocket was launched, Slothrop was blessed with a hard-on, an erection.He would look at the rockets and he would be turned off.At the same time, he would look at the rockets and he would be turned on.Slothrop\u2019s hard on was a hard one for the scientists to explain.What the Fuck?Somewhere in Europe, scientists were erecting buildings, platforms, rockets that could bring death to people like Slothrop.Slothrop suspected that the best use of an erection was not to build an edifice, but to fill an orifice.Slothrop wondered, why had men become obsessed by Death, when they should have been preoccupied with Life?Surely, there is no life without sex, no progress without congress, no creation without procreation?\u201cMake love, fuck the war.\u201d\u201cFuck war, fuck each other.\u201dHow do you convince everybody else that this is the solution?\u201cFucked if I know,\u201d sez Slothrop.The Prophet DebunkedSlothrop is cast out of the mainstream and sets out across Europe in pursuit of love, sex, and rockets (and those who would launch any one or more of them at him).Still, even equipped with his hard on, Slothrop prefers bananas to buildings and rockets, he is bent but never straight.He is the ultimate non-conformist, hedonist and sybarite, who gives pleasure to himself and to many women, Katje, Margherita, Bianca, three of the foremost amongst them.Slothrop\u2019s skepticism and excess threaten the System, Religion and Culture. He is an anarchist Counter-Force to Binary Code, Mono-theism, Uniformity and Over-the-Counter Culture. He is the unwitting counter-cultural Prophet who threatens the methodical, ordered and conformist backbone of Mainstream Society. He is a spanner in the works. He is a virus that must be eliminated. Like Trotsky, he is a Prophet that must be netted.They, the powers that be, with their uniforms and their weapons and their switches, chase Slothrop through Europe, but he remains free.MisanslothropyIn time, people came to doubt whether Slothrop ever actually existed at all.Some would ask, \u201cSlothrop? What kind of name for a prophet is that?\u201dStill They did not stop their pursuit, even when They were certain that he must be dead. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.If you can\u2019t see him or hear him, deprive him of oxygen. Wipe out his disciples. Stifle his message. Prevent it from reaching any children. If the medium is the message, remove his medium. That way the prophet and his prophecy will cease to exist. Revelations? What Revelations?Was Slothrop a fabrication? A ghost in the machine? A shadow in the light of day? A figment of someone\u2019s imagination? A fiction? Just a character in a novel? Just a story in a holy book?As Slothrop would say, \u201cI\u2019m fucked if I know.\u201dOutside the novel, the world continues as before, only more so. Buildings reach higher. Rockets and aeroplanes fly further. Wars drone on. Civilians die. Men line up in rows and columns and uniforms. Power perpetuates itself eternally. Evil perpetrates itself on people via people. Darkness masquerades as light. The sky is silent. We can no longer hear the screaming. It\u2019s all theatre, even within our homes.Group ReadI re-read this as part of a group read started by Stephen M:http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/6...Reading NotesI kept my reading notes in My Writings:http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/3...A Letter from Vlad the Impaler of Butterflies Dated April, 1973Dear Tom,Vera and I very much appreciated your gift of a signed first edition of your novel.It actually caused a little friction in the Nabokov household.I don't mean to be ungrateful or vulgar, but we both wished you had given us one copy each. (I guess we could purchase one, but we were too keen to read it.)Naturally, I started it first, immediately it arrived, but quickly found I couldn't put it down.The reason being that, every time I did, Vera picked it up and commenced reading. Initially, our respective lepidopteran bookmarks were quite far apart, but when she passed my place, she asserted her right to be the dominant reader, and I had to wait until she had devoured the entire offering, which she did by the time of Maundy Thursday.Fortunately, this left me Easter to finish it, so we were able to compare notes by Easter Monday, appropriately with a sense of renewed faith in literature.I am convinced \"Gravity's Rainbow\" is one of the finest works of modern fiction.It is very much an artistic and logical extension of \"V.\", which as you know we also enjoyed greatly.If your first novel was a pursuit of \"V\", then \"Gravity's Rainbow\" is a pursuit of V, too.In fact, it is a pursuit of both V1 and V2.Vera was bold enough to suggest that V1 and V2 might connote Vlad and Vera, though we were unable to reach consensus on who might be noisy and who might be silent. We did, however, hypothesise that Slothrop could be a reversal of Humbert.To put it bluntly (these are Vera's words, not mine), Humbert, European in origin, fucks his way around the New World, more or less.Slothrop, on the other hand, American to his bootstraps, fucks his way around the Old World.I admire the way you, even more so than Slothrop, carried off Bianca. It is some of the most delicious erotic writing I have read.Bianca echoes Dolores nicely. Even the sound of her name...Bi-an-ca. The way it rolls off your tongue, it reminds me of, forgive me for citing myself, \"Lo-lee-ta\".It's also close enough to the German acronym B.N.K. (which even a faint-hearted German reader or patient would appreciate stands for the \"Bundesverband Niedergelassener Kardiologen\", cross my heart and hope not to die).Vera was the first to detect how you reversed the reader's response to this relationship.Humbert knew damned well how old Lolita was. It was crucial to his enterprise.On the other hand, Slothrop \"believed\" Bianca was a minor of barely 11 or 12, but when you work through the arithmetic of your puzzle, you realise that in reality (and therefore fiction) she was 16 (or was it 17?) and consequently of age.So, what Slothrop did was legitimate, but what the reader (who was as yet unaware of this detail) did was not.In \"Lolita\", I allowed readers to believe they were jurors with a legitimate interest in the proceedings, whereas in \"Gravity's Rainbow\" they are complicit in a crime that the protagonist did not actually commit.The reader's voyeurism comes at a cost, at least metaphorically.Only time will tell whether America and the world is ready to be confronted with their culpability.Even if they are not, I hope your novel receives the acclaim it deserves.So, well done, Tom, Richard would have been proud.I would have been proud to call you my pupil, too (Pupil 2?), if only you had enrolled in one of my classes.Perhaps you learned more and better from my example?In the hope that you might continue to do so, I have asked my Publisher to send you a copy of my \"Strong Opinions\".I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed expressing them.Yours, with all my admiration, V.Slothropod De-Feets Cephalopod, Dutch Girl Almost Pops Her ClogsSlothrop, octopusAnd Katje BorgesiusWe were meant to meet.The Thoughts of An Erotic ClausewitzFuck Death, Fuck Rockets,Says Erotic Clausewitz,Make Love, Fuck the War.Jim Carroll Watches the Earth RecedeHow can I propelMy missile 'gainst the pull ofWicked Gravity?Slothrop's Dewy GlansSlothrop's cock, un-croppedSlots into sweet spot, then, spent,Flops soft in wet spot.Summit MeetingWho knows what worldly wisdom I might findWhen I discover myself at the peak, Gravity-defiant, all nickels spent,Trying to work out what it could have meant,And you're already there, reposed, asleep,Your trousers down and crimson phallus bent,And scattered on the snow are streaksOf your rocket-powered ejaculateThat have fallen moist, arc-like to the earth,Still rainbow-coloured and immaculate.So I read 200 sullen words worthOf the dry wit and onanistic mirthThat appeal so much to the daisy chainOf acolytes standing at your rear.As one who's usually come before,They call you a poet and a seer.It's sad we only see your back side,Though we're the ones forever left behindBy all your avant garde sorcery andThe flaccid disquisitions of your mind.Soundtrack:Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Babe You Turn Me Onhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=153eVr..."], ["I know history is rarely kind to harsh criticisms about super nebulous or \"difficult\" authors , but dig this --This book is horrible. After reading The Crying of Lot 49, Slow Learner and now this, I'm convinced that Thomas Pynchon is a hack, and the reason we don't hear from him is because he has nothing to say and knows that if we gave him a microphone and fifteen minutes he'd be found out.90% of the people who pick up this novel won't finish it, and 90% of those who do won't like it. But 100% of them will pretend they do because Pynchon has the rare reputation of being one of those authors you \"have to read\". We're all convinced Pynchon is the possessor of some private, hidden genius -- that buried somewhere between the rambling nonsensical plot and the long winded, super cerebral, jargon riddled diatribes on \"the Rocket\" and the sexual implications of its trajectory and its relation to the symphonic form is a message of some import.But for all the hype, someone please point to a passage in this novel that overreaches or couldn't be approximated by the efforts of anyone else who lived a super reclusive, hermetic lifestyle, owned a library card, and was given nearly a decade (the length of time between the publication of this novel and the author's previous one), and around 900 pages to do it in.Seriously though, don't read this book. Aside from the small flutter of accomplishment I feel at actually finishing it, I've found it to be little more than a super frustrating and ultimately hateful reading experience."], ["Gather \u2018round, everyone, and hear the tale of why the reasoning (not the rejection itself, mind you) behind the rejection of this novel for the Pulitzer Prize of \u201974 fucking pisses me off.Their reason? Obscenity. I would hope that they at least wrote an essay justifying their decision that went beyond an insipid mix of morally outraged blatherings and oblique mentions of coprophilia (he ate what? Poop? Oh, we cannot stand for this we simply must not accept this and god forbid we even think for a moment on the context or, you know, try to understand).Because right before, right before this event that in my particular edition takes up a mere two pages out of seven hundred and sixty, yes, 760, count \u2019em, of wonder and glory that I will expand upon later once I have clearly demonstrated the idiocy of the rejection, yes, right before the passage that describes the horrific act in all its gory detail, we have:\nThey have taken him so far from his simple nerves. They have stuffed paper illusions and military euphemisms between him and this truth, this rare decency, this moment at her scrupulous feet\u2026not it\u2019s not guilt here, not so much as amazement\u2014that he could have listened to so many years of ministers, scientists, doctors each with his specialized lies to tell, when she was here all the time, sure in her ownership of his failing body, his true body: undisguised by uniform, uncluttered by drugs to keep from her communiqu\u00e9s of vertigo, nausea, and pain\u2026.Above all, pain. The clearest poetry, the endearment of greatest worth\u2026\nI have never been in a war. I do not claim to understand the agony that those who participate go through, neither the soldier nor the civilian. But this I can recognize, this horrid disconnection from reality that results from society blocking you off from the realities of life with words, words, worthless words that rise like so much smoke and fall like so much ash when you realize it is all lies and there is nothing, nothing to prepare you for the truth of life and you become exquisitely aware of what They have conditioned you to be. And the question arises of whether life in this sleazed and sycophantic lubricant is worth it, and reality dims to a faint question of hunger and thirst, and your thoughts clamor at you to the edge of the precipice and all you can think about is how a permanent vacation from all this banality of evil would be nice. Very nice indeed. And the only thing that can draw you back is some confirmation that through all the living muck you are indeed alive. What is an easier answer to that eternal question than pain? Better yet, what is a more conscientious answer than pain, willingly inflicted upon the self in a controlled and safe environment, rather than going out and inflicting oneself on others in the forms of murder, rape, and physical destruction? With that in mind, who dares claim that they, an untouched outsider, have the right to condemn such a thing?What is even worse than this flimsy excuse is what was lost when the baby, with so much joyous potential and wondrous insight, was flung out with the merest trickle of slightly smelly bathwater, flung to die on the streets for showing itself as being human.Do you know what was lost? Knowledge, and better yet, a love of knowledge, sheer ecstasy at the mere sight of knowledge, adoration of subjects ranging from geography to organic chemistry to folk lore of cultures other than European to religions other than European to philosophical meanderings upon death and life and lust and shit and piss and the War, the War in none of its popular culture trappings of honor and glory and instead in its vulgar horror of wasted lives and idiotic bashings and the eternal chance of being blown to smitherings no matter if you were suffering in the worst of concentration camps or if you had found some small and precious moment of laughter in these bleak and desperate times, run by Them. Always by Them. They, who know the rules and run the show and will catch you by the genitals and nail you to the rate race and leave you to run or hang, silently screaming in pleasure all the way in an invisible construct too devious for words.Why? Because it is the very foundations of what Homo Sapien is built upon, that instinctive organism that found itself growing a shell of thought, of conscience, enough to persuade itself that it was beyond all those biological trappings, those helpless desires, those inane fears, those shameful pleasures. Because when faced with death, the natural response is life, and the natural precursor is procreation, and the natural instigator is, what? Some call it love. Others call it lust. And perhaps it would be that clean if you ignored all that social indoctrination, all those millennia of cultural bonds and civilized underpinnings, the conformation of the animal to a world of new materials, new ideas, new awareness of pain and terror in the face of an overall useless existence. If you force a creature to like something and live with it from day one, and then keep to the beat their descendants forever on, you better be ready for a blending of the biological instinct and the cultural indoctrination. You better be ready for the fetish, those inexplicable psychological bonds between a whole range of objects and ideologies, all linked up to the evolutionary instinct, the need to fuck.And when you put these individuals, who have adapted to strictly controlled world in ways that would put Casanova to shame, into a pressure cooker of death and destruction and technology specifically calibrated to rend bodies in a grotesquely unbelievable artistry, a World War that made the previous paltry and has not yet been surpassed? Furthermore, when you get Them, who sense all of this, in addition to sensing how society readily acquiesces to stories of violent rape and yet frowns on the consensual sexual relations that happen to deviate from the norm? That calls the former an inevitability brought upon by the victims themselves, and the latter a perversion, a deviation, a thing of disgust and shame? Then, dear Reader, you have the conspiracy of the millennia, where War drives sex drives shame drives settling under the thumb of Them who caters to your secret erotic delight. Who drives the War. For what? Money, of course. Ah ha, you say, of course. That excuses everything.Regardless, seems a bit wonky, no? Seems a bit, well, conducive to discussion of how civilization chooses to harness the biological drive, how it silently condones rape and loudly condemns the erratic spillover of voluntary intercourse, no matter how privately or safely it is conducted, no? Finally, going back to the knowledge. Right now, the liberal arts and the hard sciences hate each other. Loathe each other entirely. I\u2019ve been on both sides, and I\u2019ve heard the same story riddled in pride and ignorant contempt and secret fear from both. I\u2019ve even experienced both, back before I got a handle on things and started to understand the gorgeous beauty inherent in both, which exists in both the masterfully derived equations from which we control the heavens, to the powerfully themed piece of literature that speaks to the souls centuries after conception. And you know which book combines that all in a singular, sexy package? Do you know which book not only breaks the rules of what the general populace deems is the proper way to write a novel, but blurs and cracks and subsumes the boundaries between the knowledge deemed \u2018nerdy\u2019 and the knowledge deemed \u2018useless\u2019 and wraps them all in a glory that only wishes to expand the appreciation for worlds both mathematical and geographical, both emotional and quantifiable, where a sunset is appreciated for its blend of colors as well as the wondrous calculations of the atmosphere that generate such a sight? All the while skipping over emotional raptures and objective information, capturing the tragically beautiful persistence of the human spirit in nine pages recounting the tale of soldiers caroling one winter\u2019s night; the horrific capabilities of the human spirit in thirty-six pages that range from the fervent desire to breach the horizons and surpass stagnant conceptions of possibility, to the helpless lust in the face of overwhelming obliteration of body and soul, finally ending with complete disconnection except for one last push, one last tiny effort of goodwill.Simply, this is not an issue with the book, which chooses not to follow the path of literature referencing literature referencing literature ad infinitum, hardening the bubble to an insoluble force field of fear and close-minded intolerance. Which, by the way, makes it perfect for teaching, small excerpts taken out of a context that still retains enormous amounts of contextual information, spanning scopes of knowledge and lines of reasoning with simple skips of words and sentences. No, this is an issue with education itself, the handling of separate subjects in separate ways that result in the same lesson. We learn to hate learning, whether it be by the mindless cramming of scientific gobbledygook or the training to view books as a sponge to be soaked dry of every pointless and emotionally draining detail. We are taught by those who have found refuge in the ideological constraints, concentrated themselves in high enough amounts of personal pride and vicious disdain for anything that lies outsides the traditions of their specific field. We are trained to hate neutrality and loathe those who refuse to subsume their selves under a single formula, see them as traitors to the cause. As if the human mind, ever metamorphosing in endless streams of fickle time and violent happenstance, constantly shifting in reaction to similar seething cauldrons of fate and fortune, is a block that once fitted can never go back. As if empathy is equivalent to proposal, as if understanding the viewpoints of others without being able to ignore their faults is a secret sign of defending said faults. As if any other reaction to capture bonding (born and bred and colonized and commercialized) beyond stoic subservience (be grateful you have been passed over) is not a screaming across the sky for survival, is not only heresy. It is evil.Where is the joy? Where is that feeling of acquiring something and loving it so much that one wishes to show it to others, help them understand that this thing they may have feared has so much beauty and really is not so frightening or impossible to comprehend? Where is the recognition of that conspiracy of the \u2018Other\u2019, subconsciously mandated as a survival technique (incomprehension leads to fear leads to anger leads to prejudice leads to incomprehension) and now subconsciously harnessed by \u2018Them\u2019, a recognition that does not stop and gaze wistfully over to the Zone of action? Ignorance is bliss is the true evil of neutrality, and those loaded words are used to good measure of their full range of context.---I\u2019m not going to lie to you. This book is hard. The only reason I got what I did out of it is due to the following personal characteristics that were acquired by pure chance:-Love for the German Language-Formulaic Education in Engineering (specializing in Polymers) Greatly Exceeding that of FE in English-Penchant for Iconoclasm (sociocultural, sexual, linguistic, you name it, I will break it and make it bleed for the purpose of my own understanding and comfort)-Reverential Devotion to Literature-Experience (for every rule I break, I break my own brain over books like these)That\u2019s my side of the equation. This is how I cheat. I can\u2019t cheat for you, but trust me, the test is worth everything.---EpilogueAnonymous: YOU CONDONE COPROPHILIA?Aubrey: I\u2019m sorry?Anonymous: I just finished your review of Gravity\u2019s Rainbow, and YOU CONDONE COPROPHILIA?

What I am saying, or at least trying to say, is that reading a DeLillo novel too fast (meaning: fast at all) would probably be about as satisfying as rapidly flipping through all the cable channels, but for hours and hours and hours on end. You wouldn't turn off the set and say to yourself \"man, what a great show!\", and unless you're just terribly weird, you probably wouldn't go around recommending it to people. It's always a special kind of gamble recommending a book to someone, and DeLillo is some sort of king of challenges in this regard. Because of all this, I am too skittish to bother with telling people to read him or buying his books for others. However, he was recommended to me, the copy of White Noise I first read was given to me by a friend, and I did absolutely love it. Thanks, Alan! I will not continue your legacy. You just got lucky.Let's say you do want to read a short book for a long time. Hey, how about this one? It has all the stuff a DeLillo fan looks for: tarpit sentences, gorgeously sprawling theatrical scenes of terror and isolation and pack dynamics, jarring juxtapositions than somehow make you feel sane and understood, otherworldly, stilted dialogue, disturbingly authentic moments of body-on-body in all their gross and glorious and sometimes banal, individuals' thoughts bleeding into one another sometimes mid-paragraph, fighting and fist-shaking and fusing into some greater but never clearly identified truth, the sifting and blurring effects of cultural identity and historic events on the self. You against the world, you in the world, you and other people, you in other people. Crawl across this book like a snail, and so much awful-awesome will stick to you.They all thought they were bungling and desolate and tormented but none of them ever wanted to do anything else but write and each believed that the only person who might possibly be worse off was another writer somewhere and when one of them mixed too many brandies and little violet pills or placed the nozzle of a revolver just behind the ear, the others felt both sorry and acknowledged.The book jacket description is sufficient as far as plot, I suppose. Events do most definitely transpire, but as background noise to the internal wars of the characters, who experience them like you would a landscape from a car. Beyond the larger rages of the world, DeLillo's characters have this tendency to find themselves in moments of spontaneous intimacy with strangers, which would seem insincere if they didn't sometimes happen. I don't mean spontaneous intimacy like fucking in the alleyway behind a club, but rather intimacy of conversational tone, spontaneous familiarity, natural rapport, settling into a routine with each other without much fuss. Can you hear it marching in? Yes, it's personal anecdote time.I met a Thai girl almost a decade ago who was blowing through town, and developed a shared attraction with this guy I knew, bit of a manwhore. They had their own little moment of spontaneous intimacy, like fucking in a bed after drinking at the bar, and then she left town. Of course, manwhore was transfixed with the notion of this beautiful, vivacious, exotic, adorably tiny, and (most importantly) temporary girl. She had other ideas. She showed up at his doorstep a week or two later with all her bags, having left her previously unspoken of, very traditional, very straight-laced, and very controlling husband two states or so away. The manwhore reacted just as you would imagine, and I ran into the girl (her name was Ta, for short) at a bar that night, sitting all alone, very intoxicated, very confused by manwhore's sudden change of heart regarding her, seemingly wholly unaware of both the total lack of social etiquette in her behavior, and her horribly optimistic misread of this fella and his intentions. Even despite my generally consuming cynicism, or maybe because of it, her melancholy naivete was just absolutely crushing to me. Oh, and she was hard up in that moment, having placed all her eggs in a basket that liked having as many holes as possible, if you know what I'm sayin'. I reluctantly told her she could stay with me for a night or maybe two, I guess. I went to class the next day, and came home to find every speck of my tiny apartment cleaned and organized, my kitchen full, and I mean FULL, of groceries, homemade Thai food set up on the counter, new sheets and pillows on my bed, and Ta there just grinning at me as I came in with my expression of both horror and amazement, as she's all \"Welcome home, Kri-seee!\" For maybe a month or maybe three, I have no fucking idea as time sort of suspends in these situations, she just...stayed. She slept in my bed and kicked me in her sleep, we sat foot to foot on the couch, her watching these terrible Thai pop star videos and compulsively pulling out her hair while I read or did homework, she shadowed me to class sometimes and made weird but strangely sincere observations about the art she saw on the projectors, I came home mid-day and even brought friends from school to marvel at the spectacle as she made everybody ridiculously lavish lunches and hopped around singing to herself like a little kid. We had our strange routine for a time, and though I generally require about 85-90% alone time and wanted to wring her neck on occasion because of this fact, it somehow just worked for us in that time, for that time. One day, she was just gone, leaving several hundred dollars behind for me that she had won playing blackjack at the Indian casino.Like I said, these things happen, even to little ole homebody Oklahoma me on occasion. They happen to DeLillo's characters a lot. A scenario is even created in this book similar to the one described above, with the exception that everyone's screwing. Which is maybe why I just rambled about it. The weird points of human connection in life are the commonplace for DeLillo creations, and no wars or holy uprisings or terrorist bombings can take them away from that place, though the events of the world at large are forever running in the background, the small scenes providing a commentary on those greater pictures, and vice versa. And that's what Don DeLillo is all about. Even his tiniest observations will leave you looping your eyes over passages, which can make his books an awful long time. Some of the most rewarding time you can spend with a book in your hand. That's not a recommendation to read this particular book or this particular author. I don't do that. But I love this novel and this author a whole, whole lot. Maybe you will, too."], ["\u201cThe cult of Mao was the cult of the book.\u201dA writer is always said to bring wisdom and knowledge to his readers, to give them guidance, clarity of mind by using stories and instances regardless of truth as exemplars. But can the writer do the opposite and inspire terror, chaos, and bewilderment? It is often said that a writer sacrifices himself for the better fortune of his readers. Writing should be a beloved practice to those who are enamored by words, by language, and sometimes by the ability of playing god and make-believe. That is not always the case. It is easily traceable in literary history that writers have the hardest time concentrating on their works. Indeed it is rather easy to write a few pages when inspiration hits you, but writing and rewriting hundreds even thousands of pages over a grueling stretch isn\u2019t an attractive plight. Writers readily suffer fatigue, languor, creative blocks, and would often put off their work for great lengths of time. But then his suffering is assuaged the minute he publishes his work and people are inspired by what he painfully poured out of himself. But what if instead of inspiration, his horrors take hold of his prose and flow through his readers? What if he instills fear and uneasiness into their minds? And what if the book takes the form of a chimera that terrorizes both creator and receptor? In Christopher Nolan\u2019s Inception he uses dreams to put in ideas into people\u2019s heads. But in Don DeLillo\u2019s Mao II, the obvious truth is revealed, in the real world, writing books take this function. \u201cWhat terrorists gain, novelists lose. The degree to which they influence mass consciousness is the extent of our decline as shapers of sensibility and thought. That danger they represent equals our own failure to be dangerous.\u201d In Mao II, Bill Gray, the world\u2019s most renowned novelist, an aging dinosaur and an illusive sonofabitch firmly believes that he was born too late. He was of the idea that writers used to be the scale of the world\u2019s moral balance and sometimes even the force the drives it off its axis. Books inspired fear, they served as catalysts of change. Most of the visionary books were banned; great writers were often murdered and burned on a stake. People in power didn\u2019t like ideas people were getting from what they read. The Bible inspired great religious frenzy and turned lots of heathens into believers of Jesus Christ. Similar function goes for Islam\u2019s Quran. And these works inspired a great many religious wars. The Greek Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle\u2019s works inspired an intellectual revolution. The Malleus Maleficarum caused the deaths of thousands of forward thinking women. Mein Kampf was an idea that killed millions of Jews. Marx and Engle\u2019s Manifesto started a movement so hated by the world. Oscar Wilde\u2019s flair caused uproar and probably got him killed. D.H. Lawrence\u2019s vulgarity made him a literary villain. Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Miserables gave the common people the feeling of power. Jose Rizal\u2019s novels inspired the Philippine revolution. Even Nabokov\u2019s Lolita gave rise to such a resounding cry of moral righteousness. But nowadays, definitely post 9-11, terrorists and acts of terror have taken hold over the populace and what was once a mass that was affected by literary ideas now moved to terror\u2019s rhythm of fear and self preservation. The Osama bin Ladens and the Saddam Husseins of the world are now more known than the Garcia-Marquez and the Toni Morrisons. Even modern writers have not escaped the fate of fear. Salman Rusdie\u2019s Satanic Verses shows how terrorism is encroached even to the influencers emeritus. A long time ago people read books and these chiefly inspired how they think, the choices they made. Nowadays people watch and listen to terror-dominated news and their mindset and life-choices are affected by what has happened. Books are now relegated as fantasy and escapism serving as a pastime rather than a critical tool of change, and it is no great wonder the biggest selling books are about vampires and masochistic sex. What was once a public that read and reacted on ideas and concepts now dwelled on reported events. The time of the thinking man is gone; the rule of the fear-addled reactionary homo-sapien is upon us. Is this the post-modern word we live in? \u201cHe is saying terror is the what we use to give our people their place in the world. What used to be achieved through great work, we gain through terror. Terror makes the new future possible. All men, one man. Men live in history as never before. He is saying we make and change the history minute by minute. History is not the book or the human memory. We do history in the morning and change it after lunch.\u201d\u201cMao believed in the process of thought reform. It is possible to make by changing the basic nature of the people.\u201dMao Zedong, the man who graces the novel\u2019s title was not just a revolutionary leader; he was also a brilliant writer. As a youth he wrote well-regarded poems and several philosophical treatises on the subject of war, democracy and so forth. But what really symbolized Mao, aside from his images, was his Little Red Book that the Chinese people clamored for. Formally called Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, this work was printed and sold by the millions because the populace wanted to learn and adapt the ideas of their leader. I am saying this because although Mao did commit many vile acts of terrorism, what propelled people to notice and revere him was not his actions but the idea he wanted to propagate. \u201cThere is a longing for Mao that will sweep the world\u2026 eloquent macho bullshit.\u201dThis novel of set pieces isn\u2019t as coherent as I\u2019d hoped it to be. It combines hazy, fragmented views on terror, on war, of the lone and of the mass, of writing and shaping and out of the disarray comes a piercing cry out of the rubble that should be heard in the shell-shocked world of today: fear me, fear the writer. DeLillo purposely fills the book with scenes that cause unease and he reminds the reader that an idea is still scarier than an act. That the mass can never be compelled by fear and terror unless it takes root in informed viewpoints that the individual must make on his own, and that when traced, everything comes back to literature. Thus when man realizes his errs, he shall see that terror does not come from explosions and bombs, but from letters and words."], ["\u201cThe future belongs to crowds.\u201dIf you\u2019ve tried DeLillo and didn\u2019t get on with him this probably isn\u2019t going to change your mind. All the familiar DeLillo hallmarks are present and correct \u2013 every character speaking in an identical voice, every character as intelligent and eloquent as the author; dramatic tension is hewn into the sentences rather than the plot; and it\u2019s primarily cerebral in its appeal as opposed to emotionally engaging. There are five players in Mao II. Bill is a famous reclusive writer. The more he disdains any public persona the more attention he receives \u2013 there\u2019s a poignant dramatisation of the Elena Ferrante situation here. You could say he\u2019s held hostage by his reluctance to assimilate himself to the demands of celebrity. He is stalked to his remote hideaway by a fanatical fan, Scott. Scott ingratiates himself and becomes his personal assistant. Scott eventually picks himself up a lover, a waif he finds lost in a local beat up town. Karen is running from a religious cult she joined as a nineteen year old, she is also running from her family. The theme of the individual attempting to flee crowd mentality is reinforced through Karen. Then there\u2019s Brita, a photographer, who is allowed to photograph Bill and taken to his hideaway in the dark, much as a journalist might be escorted to the burrow of a group of insurgents. Lastly there\u2019s the French poet who has been taken hostage by a terrorist group in Lebanon and is kept in a tiny room with a hood over his head. Bill has come to believe the writer has been usurped by the terrorist as the prime forger of world narrative. And that they have achieved this by means of replacing the word with the mass produced image as the collective focus of debate. When Bill flies to London to take part in a reading of the French poet\u2019s work the suggestion is made that he might be able to facilitate the release of the hostage if he meets with the terrorist group. As usual with DeLillo\u2019s books, Mao II was ahead of its time. This was written in 1990 when barely anyone had heard of Osama Bin Laden. Also, as is usually the case, DeLillo\u2019s sentence writing achieves a more thrilling transcendence than any other living writer I know. I don\u2019t think any novelist has made me think about and understand our modern world to the extent DeLillo has. He writes about the present as if with the eerie razor sharp lucidity of hindsight. What happens in his novels on a small scale invariably starts happening in the real world on a large scale years later."], ["\"The secret of me is that I'm only half here....\"Andy Warhol says this & perhaps because I'm a such a nonfan of his I was a super nonfan of this.The novel infuses you with images and DeLillo attempts to do something wholly Warholesque with his own brand of literature. More discerning minds can tell me what that something is, and/or what specific effect it produces. The novel is also about: the indifference of society personified by crowds, the act of writing as a doppelganger for terrorism, and about \"messianic returns\" to humanity. The ego of the writer is totally implanted here, and though super PRETENTIOUS, I guess I did fall in love with DeLillo's comment on new lit versus old: before, everything new was explored and challenged while the newer years carry less original ideas so the modern writer uses news of the apocalypse for inspiration. (Yup, true.)DeLillo has his motifs. The limousine (from \"Cosmopolis\") is employed once again in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo. His affinity for using only first names for all characters is damn whimsical. Mass hysteria stands in for individual paranoia and fear and the monster never EVER shows his actual face in a work by DeLillo.Plot? thin threads but mostly about a writer and his assistants and how he is kind of a puppet (like the heroes (?) from the aforementioned \"Cosmopolis\" and the professor of \"White Noise\") but tries to redeem his terrorist acts of creating on the page by saving another lost writer. Very strange. There must be some poetry in the fact of that one missing writer is found and nudged into reading publicly the work of a fellow displaced writer.Here, nothing stays long enough to make sense. Is that \"Warhol\"?"], ["The Novelist as Substitute Terrorist (Or the other way round?)I have a great deal of sympathy for DeLillo's protagonist, Bill Gray, alias Willard Skansey Jr. He has my fear of being over the hill. He, like me, talks to relative strangers more intimately than is warranted. I share his doubt that any of my accomplishments have even personal importance. And I really would prefer to spend my remaining days being ignored by the world.On the other hand, Bill puts me off viscerally. His clipped conversational banter packed with urbane wit, his hapless set-up of his own professional and existential demise, his absence of credible motives for any actions he takes, his weird idea that the rise of terrorism has reduced the moral power of writers of fiction, and his compulsion to do something about that - all of it is alien and contrived. I'm left cold and unmoved in any direction.There are many captivating phrases. This is DeLillo after all. But some appear to be nonsense: \"We understand how reality is invented. A person sits in a room and thinks a thought and it bleeds out into the world. Every thought is permitted. And there's no longer a spatial distinction between thinking and acting.\" Is this a philosophy? A new understanding of the world? Or just a novelist's novelistic hubris?Other of DeLillo's quips read like they came from Pseuds Corner in Private Eye Magazine: \"... when the Old God leaves the world, what happens to all the unexpended faith?... When the Old God goes, they pray to flies and bottle tops.\" He also very much likes to bite the hand that feeds him, particularly that of publishers: \"The secret force that drives the industry is the compulsion to make writers harmless.\" Indeed, that threat of the powerful writer must keep them up at night at Penguin.The narrator's snobbishness is obvious: \"They are a nation, he supposes, founded on the principle of easy belief. A unit fuelled by credulousness. They speak half a language, a set of ready-made terms and empty repetitions. All things, the sum of the knowable, everything true, it all comes down to a few simple formulas copied and memorised and passed on ... This is what people have wanted since consciousness became corrupt.\" Who is it, does one suppose, DeLillo is addressing? Not his readers surely. More likely the unread masses, at least those not having read DeLillo, including all those dead folk born after corruption but before the DeLillian Enlightenment .And of course, authors don't fair much better. \"If you've got the language of being smart, you'll never catch a cold or get a parking ticker or die,\" says his sarcastic protagonist who has a houseful of notes, drafts, proofs, corrections, and emendations of a book he refuses to finish for no clear reason. He's a lush, a lech, and an absent father who sleeps with his assistant's wacky Moonie girlfriend and thinks that having his photograph taken is equivalent to a notice of impending death. His apparent intention is to allow Lebanese terrorists to 'trade-up' on their literary captive Swiss poet by sacrificing himself. His life, as they say, is complicated. Mostly because his egotism appears unbounded.References to Mao, Arafat, and Khomeini abound. I can't understand why. Are these the terrorists who have undermined the importance of Western fiction? If they have, does this imply that authors are compelled to involve themselves in terrorist liaisons and media-manipulation? \"Great leaders regenerate their power by dropping out of sight and then staging messianic returns,\" notes one of the characters. And? Are great novelists included as great leaders? Someone involved with this novel apparently thinks such a pretentious conceit has merit. Good luck with that."], ["Another of the second tier of DeLillo's books, this one talks of writer's block and of the crazy marriage cult of Kim Jo Pak's Unification cult. Bizarre and full of action, it is well-written and a page-turner. It is however one to read after the masterpiece of Underworld."], ["What is the role of fiction writers in world peace? This might as well be the aching question that this book tried to answer. Or offered to answer. That, for me, is what made this book different from other books about novelists as the main protagonist. That, for me, is the reason why I really like this book.This is my 3rd Don DeLillo and he is still to disappoint. This does not have the in-your-face sadness of his Falling Man (3 days) because it is not about 9/11 but this is not as artsy as the book that made me automatically buy a book whenever I see his name on the cover, The Body Artist (4 stars). There is no turning back. I will have to read all those 6 other DeLillo books that I have in my tbr shelf.The story revolves around Bill Gray who is like Salinger, recluse and elusive. One day, he lets himself be photographed (like Salinger) it made him popular until he becomes involved as a spokesperson for a Swiss writer being held hostage in Beirut.For me, my take on the story is this: novelists create dreams and this make them like \"gods.\" Even if their works are not real, there are truths in them. Truths that are universal and timeless. That's why authors like Salinger or DeLillo (although he is not recluse really) are being read. With this impact on readers, they share a part in achieving something positive in this world. Because they speak to the hearts and minds of people, they are, in a way, maybe indirectly, responsible to common good like world peace.This is a great book. My only small complaint is that DeLillo is fond of non-linear narration with frequent shifts on settings, time and characters.

DeLillo excels at such portraits set to the page, crisply and potently capturing the atmosphere of this bizarre and fascinating spectacle, with its ordered ranks of veils and ties, the regimented structure and candle-row colors that delineated the transformation of an intimate ceremony of personal commitment into a crowded and raucous affirmation of cultish charisma. After such a starkly adrenal opening, DeLillo then blurs and abrades with his initial meet-and-greet between reclusive author Bill Gray and Brita, a journalist who is bound and bent upon photographing every living major writer\u2014and continuing through to the confusing ending in Beirut, which sees Brita apparently about to compound Bill's failure to spring a versifying hostage held by Lebanese terrorists. This is primarily a series of mobile and difficult dialogues\u2014delivered by characters who all sound like Don DeLillo\u2014centering upon the state of art, fiction, photography, and mass-phenomena in this, our modern age, when terrorism was on the verge of becoming the Next Big Thing\u2014compared to fictional portraits or visual representations, a far more potent and pyrotechnic means of effecting changes in societies, of steering political discourse, of grabbing the world's attention and focussing it upon problems that were previously ignored. Where are we at when the authorial pen has been displaced in immediacy and influence by the kalashnikov and high-explosives? When murderous theatre proves the ablest way to advance one's political agenda, to broadcast in\u2014and capture\u2014the medium of the real?Mao II was my introduction to Don DeLillo, read many, many years ago. I enjoyed it even while feeling it cooly kept me at a distance\u2014its text, to me, a murky river whose current moved quickly and revealed little upon the first glance. I would actually like to return to this someday, especially in this new millennium featuring the Global War on Terror and that most horrific and course-changing of days: September 11th, 2001. I was impressed with the style and trappings of Mao II the first time around, while never believing I had fully grasped what DeLillo wished to get across\u2014perhaps a second journey would leave me more appreciative of the author's prescience in gauging the future potentiality for Terror."], ["This is a Typical DeLillo - which is by no means bad. On the contrary.First, I'd like to say that DeLillo's writing style is as ornate and expressive as ever.This is more of a rambling discussion, a loose connection of thoughts on crowds, mass movements, the Unification Church, writers, New York, baseball, terrorism, and post-modernism. Sometimes DeLillo goes for multi-page conversations, and sometimes for little aphorisms which you can repeat to impress your friends and sound wise.Again, the usual caveat with DeLillo: it's not really a novel so much as it is a collection of elements with the most tenuous connection of plot. It may almost tempt you to call it 'dull' and give up, but then you're jerked awake by a turn of phrase or insight. His musings on crowds and mass movements are intensely fascinating. The Ayatollah and Mao and Reverend Moon scenes are probably the best in the book.So if you're a devotee or dewy-eyed admirer, go right ahead."]], "review_count": "373", "description": "\"One of the most intelligent, grimly funny voices to comment on life in present-day America\" (<i>The New York Times</i>), Don DeLillo presents an extraordinary new novel about words and images, novelists and terrorists, the mass mind and the arch-individualist. At the heart of the book is Bill Gray, a famous reclusive writer who escapes the failed novel he has been working on for many years and enters the world of political violence, a nightscape of Semtex explosives and hostages locked in basement rooms.

I can't help but noticing how often the word \"pretentious\" has been thrown around in the reviews for this book. What a bothersome word: pretentious. It's a lot like the word \"boring,\" in that they both seem to fool the user into thinking that they mean something objective, when in fact they're highly subjective. Nothing is inherently boring, just as nothing is inherently pretentious. On the contrary, these words say a lot more about the speaker than they do about the thing they're supposedly describing.What does it mean, then, when someone calls a book \"pretentious\"? Let's dissect it. What they really seem to be saying is this: \"I didn't find meaning in this book, therefore anyone who claims to have found meaning is not telling the truth.\" And this boils down to the following syllogism: \"I am an intelligent reader; therefore anyone who is also an intelligent reader will share my opinion of this book; anyone who doesn't share my opinion, therefore, isn't an intelligent reader.\" A valid inference, no doubt, but hardly sound. This is because the whole argument hinges on one unavoidable fact: that by using the word \"pretentious,\" one is implicitly assuming that they themselves are intelligent. And everyone knows that only dumb people think they're smart.So hate on Paul Auster all you want. Say that you found his plots predictable; say that you found his characters unsympathetic; say whatever the fuck you want. But don't call his writing\u2014or his fans\u2014\"pretentious.\" Because that's just being lazy. And beyond that, it only makes you sound pretentious.City of Glass: *****Speaking of coincidences: I have this loose policy that whenever I'm reading a book of fiction, I also read something non-fiction; and in this particular instance, \"City of Glass\" was counterbalanced by David Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.Now, it is not my aim to create a sort of synchronicity between any two books I have on the go at any certain time. In this case, my non-fiction choice was based solely on the fact that the book was immediately available.And yet, I was surprised by a number of similarities that arose between the two. First, both books explicitly mention the Tower of Babel (in fact, if you have a copy of the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition of the trilogy, they both even display artistic renderings of it). Both books also focus extensively on language\u2014in particular, its relation to \"reality.\" But perhaps most importantly, both explore the notion of systems (mathematical, artistic, etc.), as well as what it means to operate outside of said system.For Hofstadter, this means the ability to interpret a system in a way that isn't explicitly contained within that system, which is a crucial tool for any mathematician (or more specifically, any meta-mathematician). And it's a crucial tool for Paul Auster the writer too. In \"City of Glass,\" he creates a \"strange loop\" (Hofstadter's term) between the world captured by the narrative and the one inhabited by the reader, with no clear line between them: the boundaries between what's real and what's fiction are masterfully blurred.Reading the novel, you almost begin to suspect that you were meant to be a character, that Auster probably viewed our world as identical (or at least isomorphic) to the one inhabited by Quinn, Stillman, et. al. And if that's not cool enough: by the end of the novel, Auster turns the tables again, and you finish feeling like every symbol of the story has to be reinterpreted, like the entire piece has undergone a semantic shift.Brainy, deep, fun and highly recommended.Ghosts: *****Reviewing these stories without spoiling them is kind of like trying to defuse a bomb: one with a lot of colourful and potentially unnecessary trip-wires. So in order to minimize the risk, I'm going to refrain from talking about any of the specifics of \"Ghosts,\" and instead focus on my more general impressions of the novel.Here we are: I think it might be even better than \"City of Glass.\" No wait, that can't be right. Because \"City of Glass\" was pretty fucking amazing. Really, I don't know; I was blown away by both. Indeed, it's true that harboured the fear, from the opening few pages, that the second installment of Auster's trilogy would be perhaps a little too cutesy, with the colour-names and all (\"Blue, a student of Brown, has been hired by White to spy on Black...\"). But I should have by then been aware that Paul Auster does everything for a reason. Or perhaps more specifically, when he does something for no reason, it's always for a good reason.Anyways, what I'm excited for now is finding out whether or not \"The Locked Room\" keeps up the trend...The Locked Room: ***** (???)I forget exactly where, but I believe it's in one of his letters that Plato writes, \"your best ideas you don't write down\" (or something to that effect). What he means, I believe, is that truth has a tendency to avoid complete linguistic formalization, that it avoids ever being \"captured.\" This concept\u2014or a similar one\u2014was at the core of \"City of Glass.\" But with \"The Locked Room,\" Auster seems to be actually writing it, as opposed to just writing about it.This is because it's easy to see how things like the character of Fanshawe, his assorted sub-textual works, the \"locked room, etc. all map onto aspects of the novel itself. And on a more general level, this serves to comment on our notions of self-hood, language and perception(s) of reality. In this way, The New York Trilogy is a philosophy book disguised as a piece of literature. And yet that's not entirely accurate, because it's hard\u2014if not impossible\u2014to imagine how it's contents could be conveyed in any other form than they are here.As Auster himself admits, the story found in \"The Locked Room\" is merely a facet of a larger one, one that permeates the entire trilogy. With \"City of Glass,\" we were taken to the limits of language. \"The Locked Room\" performs a similar feat\u2014less obviously, but perhaps more significantly. Auster gives us facts and he gives us names. And from these pieces we construct entire characters: Fanshawe, the unnamed narrator, even a Peter Stillman. But what does this mean? Who is Fanshawe? We are made aware, for instance, of a stark disjunction between pre- and post-disappearance Fanshawe. But with what authority can these two men be said to be the same person? And is anyone ever really just one person?Whenever you read a novel\u2014although perhaps this one more so than most\u2014you are engaged in a gathering and compiling facts. You are, for all intents and purposes, a detective: picking up clues, discarding others as irrelevant. And from these, you ultimately construct a cohesive narrative, a story. If you disagree with this sentiment, just think to the Peter Stillman who appears near the end of the novel. Who can help but wonder whether or not this is in fact the same Peter Stillman as was contained within the pages of \"City of Glass\"? For we, as readers, cannot help but straying from the text, escaping from its finite world. We draw connections, create links. Never is the text a self-contained entity. Ever.And Auster, it appears, has a keen understanding of this. So the question he seems to be asking is, what is the relationship between fact and fiction? Between name and thing? And when you finish the novel (both \"The Locked Room\" and the trilogy as a whole), you come to realize that it (the book) is forcing you to ask the very same thing of itself."], ["\u03a3\u03b5

By this claim the reviewer expresses doubt, but the expression of these doubts is the immediate solution to the reviewer's predicament, making both the doubts and the claim kind of moot. I was thinking of starting off this review the same way, given that this book leaves you wondering about everything, but thinking about that as an option makes it also dishonest, because I would know where to start with this review. Luckily I found a way around it so ta-da, here we go, smooth sailing, no over-explanation there at all!This book is a particular kind of great. It's unique in my view, but that's not saying much because my basis for comparison is rather small, so let me elaborate. \"The New York Trilogy\" is comprised of three stories. This is not surprising. It makes sense. This is also the point where the \"sense\" stops. That big box of \"sense\" you're so comfortable in, all snug and cosy and warm? This book is a bucket of cold water poured all over that adorable situation, making you jump out of the box, into a beautiful realm of wild and wondrous thoughts. The book starts with the quirky idea of the first story's protagonist being called up by a person looking for \"Paul Auster\". Hmmm, where have I seen that name? Daniel Quinn, a writer, the guy who has picked up the phone, decides to pretend he is in fact Paul Auster, a private investigator. A rather cute idea which is only the beginning of the story, and of a trilogy that becomes a very intricate riddle, with questions of identity and purpose pervading it. The author, the characters, the reader are all embroiled in these stories of stake-outs, shadowing, minicious observations and carefully planned investigations and what starts out as a seemingly cute gimmick of having the author's name as part of the story turns into an adventure you yourself become part of. You as a reader become the investigator. You'll get clues, but without the guarantee you'll get all of them. You'll get answers, but you'll have to find more by yourself.Paul Auster in bed, reading Paul Auster's novel, \"The New York Trilogy\", in New York City, New York. It's a book by Paul Auster, for Paul Auster, about several Paul Austers, including himself, Paul Auster, author otherwise known for rather austere writings.This book is immensely readable: the prose employed makes this novel a page-turner, the plot is always intriguing enough to keep one on his toes (understatement of the year). But it's difficult. It's like a Rubic's cube, only without the guarantee that it's actually solvable. To some readers, this is frustrating. To me, the beauty of this book is that I couldn't solve its mystery, despite convincing myself I have identified some parts of answers and some threads that connect everything. Paul Auster created one of literature's most beautiful riddles. It's a bit of a magic trick and any kind of reveal \"given\" to you would ruin it, so I'm not going to scour the Internet for solutions. What I am going to do, is try and solve it upon a re-read, but frankly I think I'll be a bit disappointed if I can. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of the slight headache it gave me. This was probably a bit self-inflicted. I always want everything to fit. This book is like a puzzle box, but the pieces inside are from several different puzzles, none of them matching the picture on the box, and none of the puzzle-sets being complete. I tried stomping the pieces together, hence the headache. I'm planning to return to it and see if I can fill in the blanks somehow, this time without stomping on the pieces and without any headaches. I know I'll enjoy it all over again, but probably a bit differently, knowing what I think I know. This riddle-nature of the book is what makes it so unique: uniquely readable, uniquely challenging, uniquely re-readable, uniquely enjoyable. And very recommendable. All that having been said, I really don't know how to finish this review."], ["Ma quanto \u00e8 bello pedinare (e essere pedinati) da Paul Auster?"], ["Is this three novels-in-one or a single one?Ah, well:That's four Auster \"novels\" in a row for me... and, interestingly enough, they were all very much alike (Oracle Night, The Glass City, Ghosts, The Locked Room). It's becoming clear that Auster has adopted very interesting themes, such as the transitory nature of fiction and reality; the writer's world manifested in a literal form; & the double... He writes in free-flow and non sequiturs. Yeah, I will be the first one to admit that almost always his conclusions are not concrete (and they don't have to be) and will even venture to say that with the exclusion of \"Timbuktu\" his endings are all incredibly inelegant. But damn if he isn't readable! Even the writer's ego, a quality I deem somewhat lame when personified in literature doesn't bother me. Yeah, Auster is in love with New York, with the writer, & obviously with himself. But doesn't the saying go \"Write what you KNOW\"? And Auster, perhaps not really knowing how his novels will EVER end, does do something very admirable: He keeps the reader in a trance, submerging him/her in a world completely constructed from the marriage of the writer's everyday experience and his almost-visceral psyche."], ["I think this was my first encounter with Paul Auster, a man who I met through the cult of the 1001 books to read before you die list. Prior to that I was vaguely aware of Auster and his peculiar brand of love/loath inciting literature which had friends alternatively raging or swooning, but had never bothered my arse to go and see what all the fuss was about. Turns out I rather loved this - once I had progressed beyond the first forty pages. For the first forty pages I'd already rather rudely pigeon-holed the book as \"arty-wank\", thinking to myself, Oh dear this looks like it is entering into pretentious toss territory. When I say entering I mean approaching the door marked pretentious toss and busting its way in using a battering ram made out of glued together copies of The Body Artist by Don DeLillo, then stepping over the wreckage of the door and striding to the middle of the room to stand on the podium of arty-toss-bollocks while waving its arms over its head..... but nope, turns out it's all good. Excellent trilogy, a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format which made my tiny mind spin, but in a good way, like the literary equivalent of an MC Escher drawing. In a complete about turn I then had to remove the book from the arty-wank pigeon hole and give it a little hug. This was followed by me then going out to purchase pretty much all of Paul Auster's books. Can't think for the life of me why I've not bothered to review more of them on Goodreads either. This one is deserving of a place on the 1001 books to read before you die list - just don't let the first forty pages fool you."], ["219.\tThe New York Trilogy, Paul AusterThe New York Trilogy is a series of novels by Paul Auster. Originally published sequentially as City of Glass (1985), Ghosts (1986) and The Locked Room (1986), it has since been collected into a single volume.The first story, City of Glass, features a detective-fiction writer become private investigator who descends into madness as he becomes embroiled in a case. It explores layers of identity and reality, from Paul Auster the writer of the novel to the unnamed \"author\" who reports the events as reality to \"Paul Auster the writer\", a character in the story, to \"Paul Auster the detective\", who may or may not exist in the novel, to Peter Stillman the younger, to Peter Stillman the elder and, finally, to Daniel Quinn, protagonist. \"City of Glass\" has an intertextual relationship with Cervantes' Don Quixote. Not only does the protagonist Daniel Quinn share his initials with the knight, but when Quinn finds \"Paul Auster the writer,\" Auster is in the midst of writing an article about the authorship of Don Quixote. Auster calls his article an \"imaginative reading,\" and in it he examines possible identities of Cide Hamete Benengeli, the narrator of the Quixote.The second story, Ghosts, is about a private eye called Blue, trained by Brown, who is investigating a man named Black on Orange Street for a client named White. Blue writes written reports to White who in turn pays him for his work. Blue becomes frustrated and loses himself as he becomes immersed in the life of Black.The Locked Room is the story of a writer who lacks the creativity to produce fiction. Fanshawe, his childhood friend, has produced creative work, and when he disappears the writer publishes his work and replaces him in his family. The title is a reference to a \"locked room mystery\", a popular form of early detective fiction.\u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9 - \u067e\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631 (\u0627\u0641\u0642) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06a9: \u0633\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u062a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0646: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0650 \u0634\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u061b \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u062d\u061b \u0627\u062a\u0627\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u067e\u0644 \u0622\u0633\u062a\u0631\u061b\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u061b \u062e\u062c\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0647\u0627\u0646\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0641\u0642\u061b 1384\u061b \u062f\u0631 455 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643691578\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u062f\u0648\u0645 1386\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1387\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0634\u0634\u0645 1392\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"], ["Further update, June 19th 2012.In response to several thoughtful comments that take issue with the nastiness of my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that the comments in question are essentially correct. Please see my own response in comment #32 in the discussion. And thanks to those who called me on this, apologies for my earlier vitriolic responses. In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my reviews and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of \"City of Glass\", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was \"City of Glass\", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction. Who knows, maybe I will feel differently after I've read all three stories?"], ["So this is the New York trilogy I've heard so much about. I'm at a loss for what to say, and not in the good way. I feel incredibly underwhelmed.I can't even think of too many angry witticisms. It's very bland. High school students who were introduced to existentialism for the first time could produce better stuff. When the narrative switched back to an ordinary mystery story again, I became more interested, but the rest is just profoundly dull. Language has meaning, you say? And you make references to other texts? The author searches for meaning? Do tell. You must be the next Ludwig-friggin'-Wittgenstein. Ah well. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh. I'll try one of his later works and see what else he's done. For now, I'm not impressed."], ["Baudelaire cited by Paul Auster in City of Glass: \"Il me semble que je serais toujours bien l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je ne suis pas.\" In other words: It seems to me that I will always be happy in the place where I am not. Or, more bluntly: Wherever I am not is the place where I am myself. Or else, taking the bull by the horns: Anywhere out of the world. It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not....3.5 leaning towards 4... ah, my hate-love relationship with Paul Auster...I loved some of Auster's books, Brooklyn Follies, Book of Illusions.... but he always keeps me wondering. Like his 'Man in the Dark'. This NY Trilogy (City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room)... it's a crime noire novel... and it keeps you wondering what's going on. I read ShovelMoney1's review who says, 'a study on the watched and the watcher in a sort of claustrophobic ever decreasing circles format'. Good description. Auster's writing is rather pretentious at times, sort of bothers me, but it is also poetic, mysterious and that is where he draws me in....City of Glass was a difficult start for me, had trouble getting through, including the rather pretentious pages of theories... I read some reviews here of City of Glass which were rather aggressively negative. Putting it mildly. I even considered stopping after that first one, but decided to read on and then the book got to me.... although I'm still thinking how much I liked it and what the h*** does Auster mean with those three stories that seem to make a full circle... Read it again maybe? Mmmmmm.... maybe. For now, Auster did get into my head, yet again. 'In three variants on the classic detective story, Paul Auster makes the well-traversed terrain of New York city his own, as it becomes a strange, compelling landscape in which identities merge or fade and questions serve only to further obscure the truth.'I stayed on in the house for a few more days. My plan was to do nothing for as long as I could, to rest up. I was exhausted, and I need a chance to regroup before going back to Paris. A day or two went by. I walked through the fields, visited the woods, sat out in the sun reading French translations of American detective novels. It should have been the perfect cure: holing up in the middle of nowhere, letting my mind float free. But none of it really helped. The house wouldn't make room for me, and by the third day, I sensed that I was no longer alone, that I could never be alone in that place. Fanshawe was there, and no matter how hard I tried not to think of him, I couldn't escape. This was unexpected, galling. Now that I had stopped looking for him, he was more present to me than ever before. The whole process had been reversed.

I was not so enamored with his translations, but I don't think it had anything to do at all with the work Auster did on them. It was important for me to read these poems and I am more impressed with Auster than before. It has enabled a clearer understanding I would not have had otherwise. I don't know of many writers who successfully write poetry, fiction, and essays as well as Auster does. Hard to do all these well. Generally we need to stick with what works best, but Auster is proof that sometimes we just don't know. Glad he had the courage to try other things than poetry. We are all better for it. I really cannot tell you what any of his poems mean, but there is something about them that stays with you, which is good enough for me."], ["We dreamthat we do not dream. We wakein the hours of sleepand sleep through the silencethat stands over us. Summerkeeps its promiseby breaking it.- Dictum: After Great DistancesThere's a reason Paul Auster is known for his fiction and not his poetry. Like many writers before him, Auster started in poetry but abandoned the vocation after the success of his \nNew York Trilogy\n. Having read both, I would sooner recommend his fiction, particularly The New York Trilogy.Anyone curious about Auster's poetry may be interested to know that there are inklings of his fiction, certain tonal and thematic elements that foreshadow the subjects he would later explore in his novels. The prose poem \"White Spaces\" reads, at times, like the speech given by Peter Stillman in City of Glass:It comes from my voice. But that does not mean these words willever be what happens. It comes and goes. If I happen to bespeaking at this moment, it is only because I hope to find a wayof going along, and so begin to find a way of filling the silence withoutbreaking it.My favourite poems in the collection weren't written by Auster. They are poems by the French Surrealists (Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, Robert Desnos, etc.) translated by Auster. The reason being that Auster doesn't have a strong voice in poetry, and therefore does not impose upon the style of the writer he is translating.Overall recommendation: Skip the poetry and read the fiction."], ["Prima werk, maar had er op basis van Austers proza - dat gewoon goed tot heel goed is - toch wat meer verwacht.

That seems fitting for this complete collection of Paul Auster's published poetry, because Auster's subject is the difficulty of translating experience into words. For the last 35 years, Auster has written novels, nonfiction essays, and screenplays and directed a few films, but in the 1970s, he wrote poetry. This book collects all the poems, notes from his sketchbook, his late-'60s translations of French poets, and the 1979 piece, WHITE SPACES, that marked his transition from poetry to prose. That piece, a strange combination of the two mediums written after seeing a dance troupe rehearsal, seems, in its own quiet way, like the summation of Auster's obsessions. His poetry is specifically about the difficulty of describing experience, but can be generally applied to any artistic medium or maybe even any human transaction or interaction relying on language. Some key lines, for me: \"The world is in my head. My body is in the world.\" \"The eye does not will what enters it: it must always refuse to refuse.\" \"The world that walks inside me is a world beyond reach.\" \"The tongue is forever taking us away from where we are, and nowhere can we be at rest in the things we are given to see, for each word is an elsewhere, a thing that moves more quickly than the eye, even as this sparrow moves, veering into the air in which it has no home.\" \"The world is my idea. I am the world. The world is your idea. You are the world. My world and your world are not the same.\" \"... our perceptions are necessarily limited. Which means that the world has a limit, that it stops somewhere. But where it stops for me is not necessarily where it stops for you.\""], ["As a Auster artistic advocate I've read his ten (twelve)novels and his nonfiction The Invention of Solitude and The Red Notebook. As a novelist and poet myself, I felt an obligation to attempt Auster's poetry.Collected Poems spans a decade of poetry (1970-79)and a few translated French poems of his earlier work as a bonus. From the get-go I can say that his fluid novel and non fiction prose found contrasts with sometimes awkward, soul-searching poetic moments. Yet his mastery of language, intelligence and depth are found a every corner and hidden in the nooks and crannies of hazy inspirations and expirations.The poetic journey is steady and always requires your attention and your creativity, Interpretation is never easy and you feel that you are always missing something try as you may - a bit like life in fact. Unfortunately this may be a bit too alienating to most and even if there are indeniable insights and artistic prouesses, the lack of clear cohesion and inutive innovation make it hard to relate or correlate.As you read through you get used to the awkwardness, yet you do not find the key or the epiphany of some work that reveal themselves as you go. Rather you are melancholic and find \"Facing the Music\" not quite melodic. This cacophony cackles with brilliance, but is left mostly in the shady shadows. Only when we reach the \"White Spaces (1979)\" which is a cross between poetry and introspectic nonfiction to we see the great Auster emerge.An interesting exploration, but no clear findings.As for the French poetry it is neither here nor there, just gliding.Auster is a master, but here he is in becoming. Searching, swirling.Fun, far-fetched, but a bit cold and calculated like curling."], ["Bookseller: KarenAuster is my favorite novelist, so I was thrilled to read this comprehensive volume of his prose, musings, notes, and translations of philosopHy. As with most of his work, mystery and logic interplay with a stark yet remarkably lyrical style. He has a sharp and clear vision of topics, issues, and events with complex, myriad layers of emotion and meaning as if he were a \"puzzle master\" of the human experience. Auster plays with the theme of chance vs. fate--which pervades his later work--early in this volume, so it was fascinating to see the origins of his obsession--and the genesis of his singular style--unveiled in his early work. Note: Please read introduction first, as it covers key events in the author's life--and the soci-political climate of the 60's--that had a long term and significant impact on his work and the evolution of his career. Reading about his deep knowledge of philosophy also helped me re-examine my own fascination with his work. While many of his poems address haunting issues, images of vast emptiness, inner wards, and inexplicable \"disappearances,\" he also explores deep yearnings for--and questions about--love. If you haven't read his novels, you may want to start with the stunning New York Trilogy, a triptych of 3 novellas that are masterfully inter-related."], ["Deeply philosophical, I liked the later poems better than the earlier ones. All of them show a clear French influence, and though they are often intriguing, I found it hard to connect emotionally with Auster's poetry, in contrast to both his fiction and his memoirs. There's surreal imagery here, and a constant struggle to voice what Auster feels cannot truly be voiced. The end result was that I felt suspended in a dreamlike but frustrated state while reading these and afterwards, isolated and observant but bereft of any deep feeling of satisfaction or real connection. And that, perhaps, was the point of many of these poems: to get the reader to acknowledge his own world, limited and limiting and ultimately unsayable."], ["Magn\u00edfico.

You might even be making the very mistake that \u201cTCL49\u201d might be trying to caution us against.Pierce Inverarity\u2019s WillThe novel commences with Oedipa learning that she has been appointed Co-Executor of the Estate of California real estate mogul and ex-lover, Pierce Inverarity.An Executor is a person who inherits the assets and liabilities of a person (the Testator) on their death and has to distribute the net assets of their Estate (their \"Legacy\") to the Beneficiaries identified in the Testator\u2019s Will (their \u201cLast Will and Testament\u201d).Often, people only find out that they have been appointed an Executor when the Testator has died and their Will has been located.However, it is a good idea to let somebody know during your lifetime that you wish to appoint them as your Executor, because they might not wish to accept the burden after your death.It is implied in \u201cTCL49\u201d that Pierce has actually died (the legal letter says that he died \u201cback in the spring\u201d), but it does not automatically follow from learning about your appointment that the Testator has died.This is My Last Will and TestamentA Will is literally an expression of your intentions (your will) with respect to your property. You give instructions or directions to your Executor.It is often called a Testament, the etymology of which is related to the Ten Commandments or Testimony issued by God.In a very loose metaphorical way, the novel sets up Pierce\u2019s Will as the Will of God, something which Oedipa is and feels compelled to obey.There is a potential clue in her reaction to the legal letter:\"Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible.\"Whether or not Pierce might be symbolic of God, Oedipa\u2019s actions in the novel are dictated and driven by his Will.Pierce Inverarity\u2019s NamePierce\u2019s name is also pregnant with implication, if not necessarily definitive meaning.The noun \u201carity\u201d means the number of arguments a function or operation can take; in logic, it determines the number of inferences that may be deduced from a particular fact.\u201cVerarity\u201d is not a word in its own right, but it is quite close to \u201cveracity\u201d, which has lead some commentators to infer that it suggests a concern with the truth.When you add the prefix \u201cin-\u201c (as a negative) to it, the word could be concerned with the absence of truth.When you add the first name, Pierce, to the equation, some have suggested that it implies the piercing of the truth (or untruths).Alternatively, the prefix \u201cin-\u201d might mean \u201cinto\u201d which might imply the piercing or penetration of the truth.There are also suggestions that \u201cInver\u201d might be a pun on the word \u201dinfer\u201d or the process of inference.Sign of the TimesI haven\u2019t seen any references to the American philosopher Charles S. Peirce (different spelling) who made an enormous contribution to the field of semiotics (the study of signs and sign processes).If there is any link, then Pierce\u2019s full name might imply \u201cunreliable or untruthful signs\u201d.Charles S. Peirce also recognised that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits (as long ago as 1886).This concept is the foundation of \u201clogic gates\u201d and digital computers (of which, more later):http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate\u201dAll Manner of Revelations\u201dWhen Oedipa discovers her obligations as Executor, she is initially skeptical:\" \u2018\u2026aren't you even interested?\u2019\u2018In what?\u2019\u2018In what you might find out.\u2019 As things developed, she was to have all manner of revelations.Hardly about Pierce Inverarity, or herself; but about what remained yet had somehow, before this, stayed away.\"Originally Oedipa saw herself as a pensive Rapunzel-like figure, waiting for someone to ask her, in the sixties, to \u201clet down her hair\u201d.Pierce arrives, but is not quite what she is looking for. Despite a romantic holiday in Mexico, she remains in her tower:\"Such a captive maiden, having plenty of time to think, soon realizes that her tower, its height and architecture, are like her ego only incidental: that what really keeps her where she is is magic, anonymous and malignant, visited on her from outside and for no reason at all. \u201cHaving no apparatus except gut fear and female cunning to examine this formless magic, to understand how it works, how to measure its field strength, count its lines of force, she may fall back on superstition, or take up a useful hobby like embroidery, or go mad, or marry a disk jockey. \u201cIf the tower is everywhere and the knight of deliverance no proof against its magic, what else?\"The Tristero SystemOedipa\u2019s appointment as Executor is the beginning of a series of revelations (or, in the Biblical sense, Revelations) that \u201cend her encapsulation in her tower\u201d.The trigger for these revelations is Pierce\u2019s stamp collection:\"\u2026 his substitute often for her - thousands of little colored windows into deep vistas of space and time\u2026 She had never seen the fascination.\"The stamps turn out to be \u201cforgeries\u201d, postage stamps used not by the official postal service, but by an underground rival or illegitimate shadow called \u201cTristero\u201d.No sooner does Oedipa learn of the existence of Tristero, then she starts to find evidence that it still exists on the streets of California: its symbol is a muted post horn, adding a mute to the horn of its traditional private enterprise rival in nineteenth century Europe, Thurn and Taxis.Her quest is to learn the significance of Tristero and how much Pierce knew about it.\u201cW.A.S.T.E.\u201dTristero\u2019s modern American manifestation is \u201cW.A.S.T.E.\u201d, which we eventually learn stands for \u201cWe Await Silent Tristero's Empire\u201d.It delivers correspondence between various disaffected underground, alternative and countercultural groups, bohemians, hippies, anarchists, revolutionaries, non-conformists, protesters, students, geeks, artists, technologists and inventors, all of whom wish to communicate with each other without government knowledge or interference.The postal system confers privacy, confidentiality on their plots and plans.Its couriers wear black, the colour of anarchy.Yet, from the point of view of Tristero, it is not the content of the correspondence that matters, it is its delivery.It\u2019s almost as if these companies are early proof that the medium is more important than the message.All postal systems grew from early attempts to guarantee safe passage of diplomatic correspondence between different States and Rulers in Europe.Indeed, Tristero\u2019s rival, Thurn and Taxis, was an actual postal service and is still an extremely wealthy family in Germany.A World of SilenceSilence is important to any non-conformist or underground movement, not only from the point of secrecy, but in the sense that Dr. Winston O'Boogie (A.K.A. John Lennon) subsequently maintained that, \u201cA conspiracy of silence speaks louder than words\u201d.It is the desire for silence that unites the underground in opposition to the Government and the mainstream political culture:\"For here were God knew how many citizens, deliberately choosing not to communicate by U. S. Mail. \"It was not an act of treason, nor possibly even of defiance. But it was a calculated withdrawal, from the life of the Republic, from its machinery. \"Whatever else was being denied them out of hate, indifference to the power of their vote, loopholes, simple ignorance, this withdrawal was their own, un-publicized, private. \"Since they could not have withdrawn into a vacuum (could they?), there had to exist the separate, silent, unsuspected world.\"[Note the idiomatic but ambiguous use of the expression \u201cGod knows how many\u201d, as if God or Tristero or Pierce did actually know how many.]From Aloof Tower to UndergroundOedipa is a relatively middle class, middle aged woman, who married a used car salesman and DJ for a radio station called KCUF, after her affair with Pierce.Her quest drags her from her tower and exposes her to another side of life, just as life in America (well, Berkeley, San Francisco) was starting to get interesting (1966).She is a stranger in a strange land, having grown up and been educated during the conservative, Cold War 50\u2019s:\"...she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves, blandness and retreat among not only her fellow students but also most of the visible structure around and ahead of them, this having been a national reflex to certain pathologies in high places only death had had the power to cure, and this Berkeley was like no somnolent Siwash out of her own past at all, but more akin to those Far Eastern or Latin American universities you read about, those autonomous culture media where the most beloved of folklores may be brought into doubt, cataclysmic of dissents voiced, suicidal of commitments chosen, the sort that bring governments down.\"While Oedipa is ostensibly trying to get to the bottom of Tristero, she is actually going on a journey of self-discovery.The narrative forces her down from her tower of withdrawal to street-level engagement and then ultimately into the underground.Bit by bit, she ceases to define herself in terms of her husband or Pierce, but in terms of her own identity.Like the symbol of Tristero, she has been silenced, her horn has been muted, she has had to stand by her man and be secondary.Her adventure frees her from the chains of middle class conformity.It is a preparation for a new life of autonomy.Scientific MethodOedipa\u2019s methodology is that of a flawed scientist or detective.She uses logic to make sense of what she perceives.She constantly asks the question \u201cwhy?\u201dShe builds and applies logical systems where she processes information in a simplistic binary \"either-or\", \"zero or one\" fashion (pre-empting computers), according to whether it proves a point or disproves it.She applies the \u201cLaw of the Excluded Middle\u201d: \"Everything must either be or not be.\" (Or the Law of Noncontradiction: \"Nothing can both be and not be.\")She learns things and processes them as best she can.But she misses opportunities and fails to investigate clues she ought to. She is human. She is fallible.She reads old books with different typesetting and sees \u201cy\u2019s where i\u2019s should\u2019ve been\u201d.\u201cI can\u2019t read this,\u201d she says.So she learns the limits of logic. And she learns the appeal of nonconformity and freedom and communication.Despite the masculine nature of the metaphor, she removes the mute from her horn. The Crying of Lot 49The eponymous Crying of Lot 49 is the auction of the forged Tristero stamps that takes place in the last pages of the novel.Oedipa discovers that a major bidder (possibly associated with Tristero) has decided to attend the auction personally, rather than bid remotely \u201cby the book\u201d.The novel ends with the anticipation of Oedipa and the reader discovering the identity of the bidder for the stamps.Is it Tristero? Is it even Pierce?Pynchon deprives us of this revelation.This has frustrated many readers. However, it suggests that this was not the most important revelation that was happening in the novel.The real revelation is Oedipa\u2019s discovery of herself. She sees \u201cI\u201d where previously she has seen only \u201cwhy\u201d.At the same time, she discovers America and its diversity, which is far greater than the white bread community who are content with the U.S. Mail:\"She had dedicated herself, weeks ago, to making sense of what Inverarity had left behind, never suspecting that the legacy was America.\"Ultimately, it is Pierce\u2019s and Pynchon\u2019s will that the novel and her journey end this way."], ["My first excursion into the Pynchonesque\u2026and it left me disorientated, introspective and utterly confused about how exactly I feel about it. I\u2019m taking the cowards way out and giving it three stars even though that makes me feel like I\u2019m punting the responsibility football and doing my best imitation of an ostrich when trouble walks by. I am going to have to re-read this. My assumption is that I began this book taking Pynchon a little too lightly. I decided to start my exploration of Pynchon here because it's widely considered his most \u201caccessible\u201d work. I figured even as addled as my brain is with wine sediment and Milk Duds, my big boy education would serve as an adequate navigator on this little journey. Well, around page 21, I started getting that \u201cI\u2019m lost, have you seen my momma\u201d feeling and there's not a single character in this story trustworthy enough to ask directions on how to get back to the plot. This much I think I know:Oedipa Mass (get used to monikers like that as every character\u2019s name is a play on words) is a clever, self-motivated middle-aged housewife from California who isn\u2019t above shagging the occasional stranger not her husband (hell it\u2019s the 60\u2019s). Oedipa\u2019s ex-shag partner, Pierce Inverarity, dies uber-rich and leaves her as co-executor of his estate. Inverarity is a practical joker extraordinaire and so the idea that everything may not be as it seems is teed up immediately. However, Oedipa is the kind of woman who loves a mystery and she feels compelled to play the part that Inverarity has created for her. \nIf it was really Pierce's attempt to leave an organized something behind after his own annihilation, then it was part of her duty, wasn't it, to bestow life on what had persisted, to try to be what Driblette was, the dark machine in the centre of the planetarium, to bring the estate into pulsing stelliferous Meaning, all in a soaring dome around her.\n Those first 20 pages were cake and I was feeling very much in control.Then page 21\u2026\u2026..through the rest of the novel (about 180 pages) send Oedipa (and the reader) on a fragmented, surreal, allusion-soaked, reality-bent/warped/twisted sojourn that felt a bit like a David Lynch/David Mamet collaboration where nothing and no one is anywhere close to what they seem. Dense, compact, multi-layered prose and some memorable oddball characters make the confusion plenty entertaining, but grasping the central core of the piece was rather elusive (at least for me). The framing, edgework of the story is as historical mystery centered on an alleged vast conspiracy involving a secret, underground postal carrier network known as Trystero. The calling card/icon of this shadowy organization is:\nWhich is a mockery of the horn symbolizing the real life postal carrier known as Thurn and Taxis. Eventually, I gathered that the major theme being explored by Pynchon is the untrustworthiness of communication and that it\u2019s impossible to verify information because the source is always distorted from the standpoint of the observer. Thus communication, when filtered through the lens of the recipient, often brings more confusion than enlightenment and more questions than answers. \u201cThough she knew even less about radios than about Southern Californians, there were to both outward patterns a hieroglyphic sense of concealed meaning, of an intent to communicate.\u201d At least I think that is what Pynchon was getting at in this book. My problem was that I didn\u2019t clue into that until late into the story and by that time I was simply riding the crest of the enjoyable language and mini-scenes into the finish line. Having now read the book, I feel like if I were to go back and read it again knowing what I now know, I will be able to get far more out of it. I guess I might also realize that I am reading too much into it and the emperor really has no clothes. For now, I will give Pynchon the benefit of the doubt. Based on his reputation, he has certainly earned it. Even given my less than perfect understanding of the nuances moving through the narrative, there is much to enjoy. There are some wonderful scenes and character interactions that I loved For example, the The Courier\u2019s Tragedy is a play that Oedipa sees that actually touches on the themes of the wider novel. I thought it was fascinating. There is also some magnificent passages that I could read simply to enjoy the language. \n Everybody who says the same words is the same person if the spectra are the same only they happen differently in time, you dig? But the time is arbitrary. You pick your zero point anywhere you want, that way you can shuffle each person's time line sideways till they all coincide. Then you'd have this big, God, maybe a couple hundred million chorus saying 'rich, chocolaty goodness' together, and it would all be the same voice.\n Language like that is always a pleasure to read. However, without the glue of understanding all that Pynchon was attempting to say, my enjoyment was somewhat muted. That\u2019s just me. I enjoyed the experience of reading this and, as I mentioned to a GR friend the other day, I have thought better of this book during the days since I finished this than I did while I was actually reading it. That tells me that the book affected me and seeped into my brain more than I was able to consciously detect. Maybe that\u2019s how Pynchon works, I\u2019m not sure. However, it is a question I plan to investigate by visiting his other works as well as returning to this one. 3.0. Recommended (though a bit confused)."], ["The kind of book that makes people hate books. Literally one of, if not, the worst story I've ever read. A classic English majors only book, aka people like talking about this book and that they \"get it\" make you feel like their intellectual inferior.

I do \"get it\" I got an A on the paper I wrote on this book but what I \"get\" more is that there is nothing to \"get.\" It's the act of \"getting it\" and being part of that special little crew that does that makes people enjoy this book.

I\u2019ve been reading a lot of books lately which are not easily classifiable, and The Crying of Lot 49 definitely fits that mold. For me, it is a wild ride through layers of conspiracy, alternative history (mostly in the form of an \u2018underground\u2019 postal system), some heavy-duty neurosis and 60s LA suburbia. When you have all that, it\u2019s just a waste of time to talk about whether or not there\u2019s a real plot. And it\u2019s so funny! V is another one of Pynchon\u2019s masterpieces, but The Crying of Lot 49 (written decades before its time in 1966) is both much shorter and more accessible. I don\u2019t usually include quotes in my reviews, but I\u2019ll end with a favorite passage from this book which speaks to whether you should believe in other version(s) of reality: \u201cI came,\" she said, \"hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy.\" Cherish it!\" cried Hilarious, fiercely. \"What else do any of you have?

She's searching for answers because she thinks there's a conspiracy in the male (sic).4. Dr. Halarius (sic) a doctor (sic) running away from Israelites but there's no Israelites; running after him because he was a jew nazi (umm... scratches head...)5.

Save for my paltry royalty checks and the occasional bit of fan mail here and there (fans, you know who you are), that's about all I get most days, but this still doesn't stop me from checking the box two, three, or even four times until something shows up. On the odd day there's no mail before suppertime, I'm usually left somewhat disconcerted. What, no catalogs? No supermarket flyers? Not even anything for that chick who lived here three tenants ago? I start to worry that the postman fell ill, or had an accident somewhere along the way.That's how reliable the mail is.Sure, we've all had mail arrive late, if ever at all. Things get lost from time to time, but whatever our complaints against the various couriers, what we forget in those moments of frustration is that 99.99% of the mail addressed to us in our lifetime does eventually make its way into our hands, and usually right on time!It's simply astounding. Sometimes I wonder whether UPS, FedEx, and the United States Postal Service have all colluded to pioneer some new teleportation technology, warping pallets of packages and correspondence from coast to coast, leisurely loading their bags and trucks for their local rounds while the rest of us dupes check their phony tracking numbers.That's probably even further fetched than the conspiracy postulated by this book, but not by much. Either way, the mail remains quite astonishing nonetheless.Think about it. If people couldn't send things by mail, they'd have to make every delivery in person. Only the very well connected could ever succeed in harnessing a vast network of others in such a grand endeavor, and I guess that explains why our national/international delivery systems can trace their roots back to the messengers employed by empires of old. Royal European delivery services eventually came to be rivaled by private outfits, subsequently squashed by postal reform in this country, only to return sub rosa in a campaign of guerilla mailings in 1966. Here in 2013, the government service is presently taking its turn on the ropes, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms.This isn't a morality play between big business and big government couriers, people. This is the very heart and soul of communication -- ugly, futile, and absolutely necessary."], ["I really want to like Thomas Pynchon. I love the whole brilliant but reclusive author act, and all the cool kids at the library seem to think he\u2019s the cat\u2019s ass. But I\u2019m starting to think that he and I are never going to be friends. I tried to read Gravity\u2019s Rainbow twice and wound up curled up in the fetal position , crying while sucking my thumb. Supposedly, this is his most accessible book. It was easier to read than GR, but easier to understand? Well\u2026\u2026.Oedipa Maas unexpectedly finds herself as the executor to a wealthy former lover\u2019s estate. While trying to deal with that, she begins meeting odd people and seeing symbols that lead her to a bizarre conspiracy theory about a centuries old society called the Trystero that is mostly known for running an underground postal system. But the more evidence she finds about the Trystero existing makes Oedipa increasingly paranoid about whether she\u2019s the victim of an elaborate hoax or if she\u2019s losing her own sanity.This is one of those books that I enjoyed while reading, but knew that I was missing a whole layer of meaning. I loved the idea of a rogue postal service and how Pynchon played with it as the idea of an urban myth or conspiracy theory.

Like anyone else who knows a thing or two about political participation and social capital, this book rings hollow and insincere at certain points.Briefly, Putnam rests far too much of his argument on the decline of traditional, conventional \"community organizations\" of a previous era (like The Lion's Club, the Elks or the Masons). He pays scant attention to how divisive, racist, sexist, and homophobic many of these organizations were and how they all demanded a degree of conformity. Furthermore, he manages to write off the importance of both social movements and support-based groups in a single, short chapter without acknowledging the way that social movements allow new flexible forms of participation or how support-based groups may allow a greater degree of \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" social capital. If you take an AA meeting or a meeting for single parents, of course the people in these groups have a single thing in common but they are just as likely to have many things not in common, such as the neighbourhood they live in, the type of job they have, and racial background.Further to this, his means of measurement are simply not adequate. Using the GSS to track club involvement is disingenuous, for example, because they ask \"Were you a member of this type of club?\" The answer is yes or no, and does not allow individuals to count the multiple kinds of clubs they belong to of a single kind (such as belonging to two environmental clubs).There is certainly something going in American - CONVENTIONAL forms of political participation and civic participation are declining, but there are many emerging forms of participation which Putnam writes off or ignores altogether. He acknowledges that we need to find new ways to participate that that fit our current era as the old kinds of community organization may not work, but at the same time he ignores, writes off, or undervalues the ways in which people are already participating in new and innovative ways - such as support groups, continuing social movements, community festivals, pick-up sports leagues, short-lived issue based groups, more flexible forms of political participation, and the multiple kinds of participation that are made possible by the internet and related forms of technology.Still, there is a great deal of valuable information in this book and a number of keen insights but Putnam's needs to open his mind up to new, innovative, and unconventional forms of participation and networks in order to make a more convincing argument."], ["God this book is painstaking. (Read: painful.) It's good, it's thorough, and I read all five hundred pages or whatever. But the writing style induces anguish. It's so full of qualifications like: \"But this correlation doesn't imply causality\" or \"Even when we hold race, class, gender, education, and imcome constant...\"I'll save you hours of your life and give you the summary: Throughout the twentieth century, more and more Americans were participating in clubs, having dinner parties, going to church, volunteering, working on political campaigns--until the 1970s. Then, this steady increase in partipation became a sharp drop, and civic life continues to decline. Various things could have caused the decline: women entering the work force, racial integration, the internet, longer commutes, busier work schedules. Really, though, the evidence points to two main things that caused this decline: television and generational differences (the baby boomers were less likely to volunteer, Gen X even moreso, and so on). This is a shame, because people who are involved in civic life (even something as small as playing cards or hosting dinner parties) are more likely to vote, to volunteer, to have friends, to create safe neighborhoods, to make more money, etc, etc. This book might just finally get my ass in gear to do the volunteering I've been talking about."], ["Robert Putnam's books was several books in one. The first section (about the first 4 chapters) drew me in with a synopsis of the decline of community in America. The second section, through chapter 15, nearly put me to sleep. :) Thankfully, however, I kept reading because from chapter 16 until the end of the book was so good, that I give it 5 stars despite the slogging in the middle. Putnam's five keys for social capital was worth the entire book. Here is my takeaways:Putnam list five specific areas where the trust and understanding inured by social capital helps translate aspirations into realities:1. Social capital allows citizens to resolve collective problems more easily through improved teamwork.2. Social capital greases the wheels that allow communities to advance smoothly through improved trust.3. Social capital helps widen the awareness of fellow citizens that their fates are intertwined through improved understanding.4. Social capital serves as conduits for the flow of helpful information and resources to accomplish community and individual goals.5. Social capital improves individual lives through psychological and biological processes. In fact, numerous studies suggest lives that are rich in social capital cope with trauma and illnesses significantly more effectively.Despite social capital\u2019s overwhelming advantages, Putnam acknowledges its decline, writing, \u201cAmericans have had a growing sense at some visceral level of disintegrating social bonds.\u201d Furthermore, he writes, \u201cMore than 80% of Americans said there should be more emphasis on community, even if it puts more demands on individuals.\u201d In sum, social capital isn\u2019t just the fuel for Social Power \u2013 a necessary check on State Power \u2013 but it also enhances individual lives through the sense of belonging engendered within communities. Strikingly, then, the decline of social capital, not only attacks society\u2019s freedoms, but also attacks an individual\u2019s well-being. Simply put, America cannot remain free without a revival of Social Power through building social capital in voluntary communities. With so much at stake, why aren\u2019t more people focused on restoring voluntary communities throughout America and the West?"], ["The classic that triggered the movement to study and document the collapse of \"social capital\" - obligatory and reciprocal social relationships that build through more regular human interaction with neighbors as well as in groups like bowling leagues (hence the metaphor in the title) and civic groups. By the end of the last decade, arguments for strategies and interventions that would augment \"social capital\" in both individual and communities were vogue in grant applications, showing how quickly Putnam's ideas became institutionalized.I've used an excerpt of this in my Intro. SOC class for a decade now and it's helpful for students to understand the context for the increasing alienation and dysfunction they feel in their own lives, especially when supplemented with the data that over a quarter of U.S. adults can name not a single friend and social isolation is a huge problem (and increasingly pointed to as a cause, not a consequence, of substance abuse and mental health problems.) There is also data from \"gated communities\", the phenomena separating the \"haves\" from the \"have nots\" around the world, that while residents naturally list security as a top attraction, \"knowing your neighbors\" was another top-listed reason, then many apparently drew a blank when later in the survey were asked to list neighbors they knew by first name. Only a small number listed even one. (This was a sociology study of gated community residents in Houston, TX, that was one of the original cities that started gated/locked communities. Of course, those Houstonites knew that their neighbors weren't brown or black skin, generally, so we know what is important about our neighbors in gated communities - they are wealthy and white!)Putnam is a good Liberal and no radical, but I can't help think that he didn't simply document what Marx predicted long ago, that capitalism would lead to alienation of self from others as well as from ourselves."], ["I'm not sure I could give full justice to this book in a hastily written review, so I'm not going to try. Robert Putnam's seminal treatise on social capital is jam-packed with statistics and information to back up his claims that social capital has been on a serious decline since the 1960s, much to the detriment of American society. He delineates a difference between two types of social capital--bonding (strong ties to a small inner circle of people, like family) and bridging (weak ties to a diverse and sprawling array of people)--and the struggle to balance between the two, even while both are declining. He explains the history of social capital and the decline, the possible reasons contributing to the decline, reasons why the decline of social capital is bad for society and suggestions for things that can be done to slow the decline. Everything he says is extensively researched and cited. Every time I thought I had come up with a counterargument or a detail he had missed, he addressed it a few pages or chapters later. The only problem with the book is that it was written in 2000. A surprising number of things have changed in the last eight years, including but not limited to: 9/11, Katrina, George Bush, Facebook/Myspace, broader expansion of use of the internet, 2008 Democratic Primaries, Iraq War, rise of the \"green\" movement, cheaper air travel, etc. In the last section of the book, he challenges society to make a series of changes by 2010, changes that sound somewhat impossible to achieve in so short a time. But, after just these eight years, it seems that much of what he prescribed is on its way to coming true, and I am very curious as to what he would have to say about it. Unfortunately, I think his research has moved on to other topics (diversity...). In any case, this is a very important book about the way members of our society interact (or don't interact) with each other and what that means."], ["Social capital is the grease that keeps society moving, but over the past 30 years it has decreased. Bowling Alone is the influential book that gathered the data behind this trend and put social capital on the radar of the nation.Social networks give rise to generalized reciprocity and trust. This is social capital. Reciprocity and trust are most useful when applied generally and not just those who have helped you in the past. Social capital allows society operate smoothly. People rely on social connections for friendships, romantic relationships, job referrals, and community and political organization. Social capital is correlated with individual happiness and with community goods such as lower crime rates.For all the good that it causes, social capital is, like most tools, not unambiguously good. Gangs and the KKK are held together by social capital just as the PTA and Habitat volunteers are. Being gay in a close knit conservative Christian community can ruin lives. The rarely realized ideal is a society with large amounts of social capital and a large tolerance for difference, but the tensions between these tendencies are hard to reconcile.Bowling Alone analyzes empirical data to show that social capital had been declining for 30 years (the book is copyright 2000, data from earlier). Putnam considers political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace connections, altruism, volunteering, and philanthropy, and perceptions of reciprocity, honesty, and trust. All measures have shown declines, from mild to dramatic. Some new trends seem to defy the decline (e.g., internet communities), but Putnam makes a compelling case that social capital is generally declining.Consider volunteering as an example. In the US, we volunteer about twice as much as in other developed nations. Volunteering may be formal (through an organization such as United Way) or informal (house sitting for a neighbor). Over half of Americans volunteer when informal volunteering is counted. Volunteering is correlated with higher levels of philanthropic giving.Education predicts volunteer activity; college graduates are twice as likely to volunteer. Parents volunteer the most because of their involvement with activities related to their children (e.g., school, sports teams). Community size, wealth, and family status are other predictors of volunteer activity. Americans who entertain at home are also more likely to volunteer than those who do not.Community involvement is the most important predictor of volunteer activity. Data from 1996 shows that 73% of members of secular organizations and 55% of members of religious organizations volunteer. Only 19% of individuals not involved in organizations volunteer. Members of religious organizations tend to volunteer mostly for their church. Organizations provide volunteer opportunities for their members and act as recruitment pools.Over the past 30 years, volunteer activity has not dropped across the board. Formal volunteering has decreased, but informal volunteering is more common. More people outside of organizations are volunteering, but they do not form long term relationships. There is a troubling generational decline with respect to volunteer activity. The \"long civic generation\", the generation before the Boomers, has volunteered more at every stage of life than the Boomers and Generation X is worse (although there have been indications that the Millenials may be reversing this slightly).What is behind the declines in volunteering and other types of participation? Given the difficulty of analyzing social trends, Putnam's explanations are guesses. Up to 10% of the decline in these measures can be attributed to time and money pressures on families, up to another 10% can be explained by suburban sprawl and long commutes, and another 25% can be explained by electronic media, especially television. By far, the largest contributor generational succession. The Boomers and Generation X replace the long civic generation in numbers, but their percentage participation is comparatively abysmal. This may explain up to half of the decline in participation. Why this is occurring is an open question.Overall, Bowling Alone was a fascinating and informative book. The quantitative information makes it a valid and credible resource. The publication of Bowling Alone prompted debate over the conclusions Putnam drew, but makes it clear that there are trends to consider, and whether they are considered good, bad, or neutral, they are worth examining."], ["read for my social democracy seminar. it seems really logical now, but when the book was written in 1995, and it was really, really revolutionary. his main thesis is that americans are not volunteering in the same ways in before - we are not joining community organizations anymore. young people are still volunteering, but mostly individually. (his title comes from the fact that people don't join bowling leagues anymore.) i would recommend reading the first half, skimming the statistics, and reading the conclusion. it's genius for what it is, and i wish more people would read it. it was so ground-breaking."], ["This is one of those books that I suspect of being cited (and argued against) far more often than it's read. In my head, I had it classed vaguely as pop social science. Turns out, I was very wrong. Bowling Alone may be the most academic book I've read since leaving college, and at times I felt like I was being beaten to the ground by statistical clubs coming at me from every direction. But despite the leaden density and occasional painful-in-retrospect predictions about our technological future, this is an important book, one that's challenged many of my assumptions and given me a new framework in which to consider everyday events.And no, I don't just like it because it, like me, is critical of cars, critical of televisions, and willing to blame the Baby Boomers for planting the seeds of so many of our current social ills. But I admit those things don't hurt."], ["Putnam's research on this phenomenon is valuable, but because of his egalitarian convictions he obscures a core cause of it (multiculturalism and non-White immigration) and refuses to draw the obvious conclusion or make the necessary policy recommendations."], ["I found this book fascinating, and couldn't stop talking about it while I was reading it and for several months afterward. While I found the approach to \"social capital\" somewhat akin to commoditizing friendships and civic interaction, I found so much richness in Putnam's thoughtful analysis of multiple diverse data sources, with plenty of charts and graphs to enjoy!Putnam's premise is that our stores of social capital in the U.S. have been making a drastic plummeting curve (in visual terms) since the 60s. As I understand it, by social capital he is referring to the social connections that make a cohesive community, or on a larger scale, a nation. These can include informal measures such as playing cards, bowling leagues or having friends over for dinner, or formal measures such as PTA enrollment, church attendance, and voting. He presents chapters and chapters of evidence to support his observation, and attempts to explore a few possible explanations for this phenomenon. I appreciate that he doesn't pretend to have the answer, and doesn't present one possibility as the culprit. I also appreciate that he takes a look at the \"dark side\" of social capital--homogeneity and exclusivity. This book was published in 200, so I would love to read an updated look at this topic.Here are a few examples from the book:\"During the fist two-thirds of the century Americans took a more and more active role in the social and political life of their communities--in churches and union halls, in bowling alleys and clubrooms, around committee tables and card tables and dinner tables. Year by year we gave more generously to charity, we pitched in more often on community projects, and (insofar as we can still find reliable evidence) we behaved in an increasingly trustworthy way toward one another. Then, mysteriously and more or less simultaneously, we began to do all those things less often.We are still more civically engaged than citizens in many other countries, but compared with our own recent past, we are less connected. We remain interested and critical spectators of the public scene. We kibitz, but we don't play, We maintain a facade of formal affiliation, but we rarely show up. We have invented new ways of expressing our demands that demand less of us. We are less likely to turn out for collective deliberation--whether in the voting booth or the meeting hall--and when we do, we find that discouragingly few of our friends and neighbors have shown up. We are less generous with our money and (with the important exception of senior citizens) with our time, and we are less likely to give strangers the benefit of the doubt. They, of course, return the favor.\"(183)\"Compared with the citizens of most other countries, Americans have always lived a nomadic existence. Nearly one in five of us move each year and, having done so, are likely to pick up and move again. More than two in five of us expect to move in the next five years. As a result, compared with other peoples, Americans have become accustomed to pitching camp quickly and making friends easily. From our frontier and immigrant past we have learned to plunge into new community institutions when we move.Nevertheless, for people as for plants, frequent repotting disrupts root systems.\"(204)\"The car and the commute...are demonstrably bad for community life. In round numbers the evidence suggests that each additional ten minutes in daily commuting time cuts involvement in community affairs by 10 percent...Strikingly, increased commuting time among the residents of a community lowers average levels of civic involvement even among noncommuters...In other words, this appears to be a classic \"synergistic effect,\" in which the consequences of individual actions spill beyond the individuals in question. In the language of economists, commuting has negative externalities.\"(213)\"Electronic technology allows us to consume this hand-tailored entertainment in private, even utterly alone...As the poet T.S. Eliot observed early in the television age, \"It is a medium of entertainment which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, and yet remain lonesome.\" The artifice of canned laughter reflected both the enduring fact that mirth is enhanced by companionship and the novel fact that companionship could now be simulated electronically.\"(217)\"Child psychologists speak of a fairly primitive stage of social development called \"parallel play\"--two kids in a sandbox, each playing with a toy but not really interacting with each other. In healthy development children outgrow parallel play. But the public spectacles of television leave us at that arrested stage of development, rarely moving beyond parallel attentiveness to the same external stimulus.\"(244)\"With evidence from a single point in time, we cannot distinguish between life cycle and generational effects, but if we follow a given cohort over the years, we can more readily distinguish the two. And the two effects have dramatically different social consequences. Life cycle effects mean that individuals change, but society as a whole does not. Generational effects mean that society changes, even though individuals do not.So before we can tell whether the ubiquitous age-related differences in civic engagement are truly generational, and thus producing social change, we need to determine whether these differences are attributable to the normal life cycle. With comparable evidence across several decades, we can follow each cohort as its members move through various stages of life. If successive cohorts generally retrace the same ups and downs as they age, we can be reasonably sure that we are observing a life cycle pattern. If not, it is more likely that age-related differences are generational in origin.\"(248)\"Social scientists have long been concerned about \"dilemmas\" of collective action. Such dilemmas are ubiquitous, and their dynamics are straightforward. People often might all be better off if they cooperate, with each doing her share. But each individual benefits more by shirking her responsibility, hoping that others will do the work for her. Moreover, even if she is wrong and the others shirk, too, she is still better off than if she had been the only sucker. Obviously if every individual thinks that the others will do the work, nobody will end up taking part, and all will be left worse off than if all had contributed.\"(288)\"It turns out that in states where citizens view other people as basically honest, tax compliance is higher than in low-social-capital states...Similarly, surveys have found that individual taxpayers who believe that others are dishonest or are distrustful of government are more likely themselves to cheat. My willingness to pay my share depends crucially on my perception that others are doing the same. In effect, in a community rich in social capital, government is 'we,' not 'they.'\"(347)"]], "review_count": "4", "description": "In pursuit of fairness at any cost, we have created a society paralyzed by legal fear: Doctors are paranoid and principals powerless.

Many of them are stranger-than-fiction episodes (which Paul Auster obviously has a penchant for) and make for a good bedtime read. There were a handful of stories that left an impression deep enough to make me want to jot down the story synopsis, but apparently not deep enough for me to remember when I failed to actually write them down :p Except for one. There was this story, towards the very end of the book, about a woman in her 60s who who purposely downshifted her lifestyle and became a homeless. She sold her house and all her possessions, invested the money in some fund from which she receives a few hundred dollars a month (she makes it clear that she's not on welfare), moved to another state where it's warmer, rented a spot in someone's backyard where she pitched a tent, and she spends her days reading at the library, watching dress rehearsals at the local theater for free, goes to gallery openings where she can both enjoy art and free appetizers. She doesn't explain what led her decision and what kind of life she's led before (except she does have a daughter who she talks to occasionally on the phone), but she comes across as an intelligent, decent and responsible American citizen. She ends her piece by noting she does have anxiety and fear about what'd happen if she got sick, about the imminent winter season, about the future. Her closing sentence is \"Wish me luck.\"Ever since I heard this story, she's stuck in the back of my mind, and every so often, I send her my best wishes and hope that she is doing well.On a side note, purchasing this audiobook on iTunes made me realize how iPod app is very audiobook-unfriendly. Lack of chapter divisions and bookmark functionality make it difficult to re-listen to stories that you liked or even to find the spot where you left after re-launching the app. It annoyed me enough to swear I'd never buy an audiobook on iTunes and to go sign up on Audible.com.

He is stuck in Artic ice, and although I have read whole books about how terrible this is - he sums it up in one beautiful paragraph. The book doesn't need editing.

Great stuff on the \"Lady Juliana\"."], ["This is a charming little narrative of an ordinary seaman who twice rounded the globe. Of particular interest to me was his voyage on the female convict ship the Lady Juliana. His brief biographies of some of the women are corroborated by other sources. Nicol really illustrates the genuine fear sailors lived in of being press-ganged. His adventures span from the American Revolution to the Napoleonic wars. It is a narrative and life worthy of a movie. It reads simply and with pathos. Nicol's description of sailing on a Portuguese vessel is particularly vivid. The tales of religious superstition of the sailors under the spell of a 'back priest' was truly compelling, especially as the sailors left their post during a storm to pray and have holy water sprinkled on them almost at the cost of their vessel foundering! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a sailor's life in the 1700s to 1800s. It's connection to Australia's colonial history is really incidental rather than central."], ["I loved this book simply because it gives a rare insight into the life of an ordinary person in the late eighteenth century.Nicol was a Scottish seaman who spent his adult life in the merchant navy and latterly as a \"pressed man\" in the British Royal Navy.He speaks eloquently of his voyages from whaling off Greenland to meeting the natives of the Sandwich Islands (The Hawiian Islands) just days after Captain Cook was murdred there.He also gives first-hand accounts of three levels on depravity in man's inhumaity to man - pressed men in the Royal Navy (esentially men forced to serve on war ships for indeterminate periods), the transportation of convicts from British jails to Port Jackson (modern day Sydney Australia) to the lowest of the low, the slaves in the West Indies."], ["This wonderful book is up there with Joshua Slocum's great saga \"Sailing Alone Around the World\". The two men lived during the same period of history and it's tantalising to think that their paths may well have crossed. When he was a very old man, John Nicol was discovered picking up lumps of coal to keep from freezing, by a publisher who encouraged him to write his memoirs. He writes in his own voice about his many voyages and events that we're more familiar reading about in history books. Recommended for anyone who is interested in history and the people who lived it."], ["Found this little biography in London in a museum gift shop, and couldn't put it down--a real-life adventure at sea, complete with romance, Napoleonic-era battles, and all the ingredients of a great movie. Loved the epilogue about how the author was 'discovered' by the biographer, as a poor & destitute old man gathering coals in Edinburgh, and then sales of the book made him rich!"], ["A history of a comman man that just \"happened\" to sail around the world 6 times and live to tell about it.my favorite part is where he tells the story of the sailor who took a wife so fat they had to hoist her on board the ship with the cargo pulleys."]], "review_count": "1", "description": null, "author": "John Nicol"}, "Moon Palace": {"average_rating": "3.99", "review": [["This is a book about gettin' nekkid.I discovered Paul Auster through the 1001 books list and then went on a big PA binge. I suppose I should have been more restrained because very soon all the PA plots and machinations and convoluted po-mo madness was churning in my brain. I'd given myself PAP. Yes, that well know literary syndrome, Paul Auster Poisoning. This was my third consecutive read and I believe it can be directly attributed to the onset of a severe case of PAP. But I did enjoy this book (therefore equating PAP to eating too much cotton candy but still feeling compelled to go on eating more despite what various parts of your body are telling you). Moon Palace is weighty with symbolism and duality and as usual there is a synchronisty between a lot of his stories. But so are many of his books. Hence the PAP.Protagonists Fogg , Effing and Barber all try at some point to reduce their lives to the most distilled essence possible. A bit like putting yourself through a life juicer in order to be left with only the purest extract. Fogg does this by relinquishing all of his possessions and becoming homeless, Effing by renouncing his past and creating a new one for himself and then later by distributing his wealth and Barber does a similar thing by relinquishing his home. Maybe its a form of unburdening as well as reduction.All of the people in this book were seeking something and in each of their stories they seem to believe that by peeling off all the outer trappings of possession and wealth will they expose the core of themselves to world. They will be naked. See, I told you this was a book about being nekkid. Apologies if you were expecting a more titilating variety of nekkidity. Ultimately making themselves as vulnerable as possible leads to their undoing either physically or emotionally. All in all a very satisfying novel, but let this be a warning to you all. Paul Auster should only be taken in small doses and be sure to let one plot settle before you gorge yourself on another."], ["Moon Palace, Paul Auster \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e

this in the summer but i was going out all the time and i was working and i was having so much fun (SUMMER I NEED YOU, PLZ COME BACK) so reading was not in my plans at all. I picked it up about a week ago and i must admit that i kind of fell in love with Auster's writing and Auster's story.  The way he uses the first person narrative is so well done that i started thinking all over again about narration techniques. Authors who are genuinly talented and use the first person narrative are a bliss. I loved everything that he gave in this one.  Marco Stanley Fogg. This character split me in half. Or even more pieces. I liked him in the beggining, then disliked him, then liked him again, then disliked him again. In the end i would say that i feel sorry for him but also i don't. I know i am not making any sense but that's how i feel about him. All the characters had depth, all of them seemed real, both with their sins and their virtues. The story was interesting, the stories within the story were interesting, all of it was beautifully written and given to us. I won't say anyhting more. I loved this.

Paul Auster has a way with words. The coincidences he appeals to however are way too much (view spoiler)[and in the end everyone dies or is somehow lost for no real purpose in the plot. (hide spoiler)]. The main character goes through despair, a state of balance, happiness and then he loses everything, but he finds out the key to his past. I didn't really understand the point of this book: was it that everything in life is transient, was it that life is full of coincidences, was it that in the end you lose everything and you have to deal with it one way or another? I am not sure. So, here's an example of a well-written book about a really far-fetched series of coincidences. Intriguing. Good, but not so good..."], ["While this book starts well, it soon goes downhill. The central character in the beginning is Marco Stanley Fogg. He drew my attention. What happens to him gives the reader a lot to think about. He is an orphan and has no relatives. He is totally alone, or so he thinks. Until..... Well, I am not going to tell you. And he is broke. When? 1969. Where? Brooklyn. I liked the writing. I liked the philosophical thoughts, his thoughts about writing, about travel, about how people interact and our need for connection with other human beings. All of this I found interesting! Then he meets Kitty. I liked her too. However, the further you proceed the further the focus shifts from Marco to others and the weaker the story becomes. Mostly the book follows an elderly man, Effing. He is 84 in 1969. But who is Effing? First their stories are woven together, but then the Effing personality takes over. His story? Well it is crazy, as far as I am concerned. His story goes on and on, and on and on. It\u2018s too long, goes off on all different tangents, none of which were either credible or interesting. One example, to be specific, are (view spoiler)[the pages and pages and more pages about a book written by Effing\u2019s son. (hide spoiler)] Yes, there is a connection between Effing and Marco, but that connection is in no way credible. At least two thirds of the entire book left me totally unengaged. Little to think about. How is it possible to be engaged in a story that is beyond belief? In addition, this part of the book turns into a movie script. The narration by Joe Barrett is absolutely excellent. I enjoyed Timbuktu very much, but Moon Palace is unwieldy."], ["\u062a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0642\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0631

Everyone pretends omniscience in the classroom, but god forbid you spout off like an intellectual outside of it. And then you have the subculture of people making an effort to read Pynchon in public, and the other subcultures that amuse themselves at their expense. The verdict seems to be know it all, but please, spare us from your efforts to prove it.I'd sell my soul to write like this at the age of six and twenty. There, I admitted to lack of know-how when it comes to the realm of Pynchon. Of course, the reference to souls might not be worth much coming from someone with no memory of being religious in any sense, but I'd like to think the Catholic upbringing accredits the statement somewhat. My horse may be hitched to atheism, but I can still appreciate good theological diatribes with healthy roots in philosophy and literature.Which is what I'm getting at here. Roots. Easily graspable statements with esoteric legs to stand on. A sense of context that spans the contemporary as easily as the ancient, and ties the two together in the delightfully tangible sense. Ivory computers, porcelain circuitry, old materials caking the eternal Street from 1955's Norfolk to 1919's Malta and beyond. To say the word 'automaton' and have the images of golems and cyborgs seamlessly interweave on the succeeding pages. This isn't your banal tactic of cultural references and knowledge dropping at every turn. I suppose I should give credit to Neal Stephenson for setting up an apparatus of tin foil and pipe cleaner, to better display Pynchon's idol of ebony and titanium. The desire to imitate that deceptive depth of story is understandable. Not everyone can write in the style of the yo-yo, apex to apex, apocheir to apocheir, without the bottom ponderously dropping out or the string severing at the zenith or the snagging speed making the ride sickening to the stomach.And again, six and twenty! 1963! In the US! Did you know that this book passes the Bechdel Test? I wouldn't have believed it either, least not without reading it for myself. Or believed without experiencing for myself how conscious the story is of life and its seeming coincidences, long lines of 'plot' drifting back and forth from immediate relevance to useless trivia. It never forsakes the surface details for the underlying meaning, and vice versa, and there's even spots of real humor and true beauty to be found. It's a rare talent that belies Pynchon's youth, to describe the passions that drive the intricate clockwork of the small days, and contextualize them in the themes that have, do, and will span for millenia. And to switch from one to the other without any noticeable jerks or shuddering! It makes one question the validity of the categories of knowledge that we function in, conventional discourse that so many gain use of by sacrificing the essence of their critical thinking. Puzzle pieces guaranteeing a pretty picture, inherently forsaking its right to a blank canvas.\n\"Events seem to be ordered into an ominous logic.\" It repeated itself automatically and Stencil improved on it each time, placing emphasis on different words--\"events seem\"; \"seem to be ordered\"; \"ominous logic\"--pronouncing them differently, changing the \"tone of voice\" from sepulchral to jaunty, round and round and round. Events seem to be ordered into an ominous logic.\nSo, knowledge? Pynchon has it, and shows it in endless waves of connective tissues. I don't claim to understand all of it. But I have to thank him for my new-found way of thinking about this reading business of mine, my yo-yoing along the V shaped tracks of books like his, picking up bits and pieces with every passing over the same old stomping grounds. There's a surface of tin cans and plastic rubbish in those lands, and a wind whistling of ages past that sounds all the clearer the longer you walk. You can walk forward, and you can walk back, but to tread the same way twice is an impossibility, for better or for worse."], ["How Hard Can It Possibly Be?\"V\" isn't so much a difficult novel to read - it is after all just words, most of which are familiar - as one in which it is sometimes hard to understand what is going on and why. What does it mean? Does it have to mean anything? How does it all connect?Ironically, if not intentionally, the inability to determine what and why, as well as who, is part of its design. Pynchon mightn't want to answer all the questions he or life asks.However, that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of food for thought in the novel.Pynchon actually tells us a lot all of the time. Like \"Ulysses\", there are lots of hints and clues and allusions, and it's easy to miss them, if you're not paying attention to the flow of the novel and taking it all in. It's definitely a work that benefits from multiple readings.Characters Both Sacred and Profane\"V\" starts with one of two protagonists, the schlemiel Benny Profane, on Christmas Eve, 1955. On the anniversary of the sacred day upon which a Virgin, Mary, gave birth to Christ (and thus started what would become Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant), Profane is wearing black levis, a suede jacket, sneakers and a big cowboy hat, a sort of bohemian uniform at the time.He drops into the Sailors' Arms, which welcomes sailors from the tempestuous sea onto solid ground. For them, it's a dream come true, where the barmaids \"all love to screw\" and \"remind you that every day is Christmas Eve\".This tavern is a haven and safe harbour. The big-breasted women here provide comfort and succour to men, something we can easily get used to and take for granted.A Form Guide to StencilSixty pages later, Pynchon introduces us to the second protagonist, Herbert Stencil, a man who refers to himself in the third person, which allows him to create a repertoire of bad faith or inauthentic identities (or Sartrean \"impersonations\"). He has no one solid persona, but somehow the ability to think of himself as and be not just the third person, but a first, a second, a fourth and a fifth permits him to function reasonably adequately (if not always normally) for a male, and so the multiple personalities \"keep Stencil in his place\".When we meet him, however, his \"place\" is not static, it's dynamic. He is on a single-minded quest to find evidence of a woman named V. who he believes once knew his deceased father:\"As spread thighs are to the libertine, flights of migratory birds to the ornithologist, the working part of his tool bit to the production machinist, so was the letter V to young Stencil. \"He would dream perhaps once a week that it had all been a dream, and that now he\u2019d awakened to discover the pursuit of V. was merely a scholarly quest after all, an adventure of the mind, in the tradition of The Golden Bough or The White Goddess.\"With these V-shaped analogies and the allusion to these non-fiction works (is \"V.\" itself just such a scholarly quest?), Pynchon gives us some insights into the myth and mystery and significance of \"V\".The next paragraph gives us even more clues as to the nature of the pursuit or quest in general:\"But soon enough he\u2019d wake up the second, real time, to make again the tiresome discovery that it hadn\u2019t really ever stopped being the same simple-minded, literal pursuit; V. ambiguously a beast of venery, chased like the hart, hind or hare, chased like an obsolete, or bizarre, or forbidden form of sexual delight. \"And clownish Stencil capering along behind her, bells ajingle, waving a wooden, toy oxgoad. For no one\u2019s amusement but his own.\"In Pynchon's next novel, \"The Crying of Lot 49\", a woman, Oedipa Maas, would be the subject in and of the quest. She would be the one doing the detective work. Here, a male is the subject and a woman is the object of the quest or pursuit.While both Oedipa and Stencil take their quests seriously, they meet with mixed success (perhaps a hallmark of a post-modern fiction). However, Pynchon seems to venerate Oedipa more highly. For all his earnestness, profundity and third person pretension, Stencil is a clown or a fool to match Profane's picaresque schlemiel.\"A Beast of Venery\"We all know the word \"venereal\", but how often do we see its root, \"venery\" (which means sexual indulgence or the pursuit of or hunt for sexual activity)?The quest for man, if not necessarily for Stencil, is a quest for sexual pleasure, for sexual delight, for the sexual conquest of woman.Stencil is looking for one woman. However, because she is of his father's generation and vintage, you have to ask whether in reality he is trying (potentially on behalf of all men) to understand the mystery of sexual attraction, the mystery of womanhood and the place of women in society and, if only from a male perspective, the role of woman in a man's life. The Birth of VenusFrom an etymological perspective, the word \"venery\" derives from the Latin \"veneris\", which in turn derives from the Roman god of love and sex, Venus, who in turn was modelled on the Greek god, Aphrodite.The connotation of pursuit is thought to come from the resemblance of the word to the Latin \"venari\", which means to hunt.Not coincidentally, the Botticelli painting \"The Birth of Venus\" features in the novel.According to Robert Graves, Venus was also adapted from the pagan sea-goddess, Marian, who was often disguised as a merry-maid or mermaid. Suffice it to say, this Venus rose from the sea, hence the shell in the painting.If we go back further in time, we meet another goddess Astarte, whom the Egyptians worshipped as a goddess of war and tenacity, while the Semites worshipped her as a goddess of love and fertility. The Greeks would later adapt Astarte as the basis of Aphrodite (on the way to the Latin Venus). It is also linked to the goddesses and names Astoreth, Ishtar and Esther.Esther is the name of a character in the novel, (partly Jewish, she gets a nose job in an attempt by her plastic surgeon who wishes to make her look more Irish), while a model of Astarte is the figurehead of the xebec or sailing ship upon which Stencil's father Sidney died in the Mediterranean off Malta in 1919. In a way, Sidney's death might be a return to the embrace of Venus (after all, she was a V) and the great unknown of the ocean?Opposing ProtagonistsProfane and Stencil inevitably meet each other over the course of the novel and collaborate in Stencil's quest as it moves from Manhattan to Malta.They approach life and womanhood in contrasting ways.Here's a summary of Profane:Aimless, directionless, concerned with the present, existential, free-style, random, improvisatory, profane, superficial, more interested in the surface, physical, decadent, irrational.And Stencil:Motivated, purposeful, concerned with the past, in pursuit of understanding and meaning, structured, organised, profound, more interested in depth, metaphysical, civilised, rational.Despite their differences, they join together in Stencil's quest. What they share, obviously, is their manhood, the fact that they are men in a patriarchal society. Whatever their differences as men, they are on the inside, whereas women, in contrast, are on the outside, subjugated, unable to exercise political power or social influence, whatever other means of persuasion they might have at their disposal.\"Not Who, But What\"Stencil's quest starts when he inherits a journal in which his father wrote the following cryptic note:\"There is more behind and inside V. than any of us had suspected. Not who, but what: what is she. God grant that I may never be called upon to write the answer, either here or in any official report.\"There is a suggestion that Young Stencil is trying to find his own identity in V. He was raised motherless, having been born in 1901, which we are also told was the year \"Victoria\" died.Stencil, speaking in the third person, says:\"You'll ask next if he believes her to be his mother. The question is ridiculous.\"But does it mean the answer is ridiculous? Does it mean we shouldn't ask the question? Are Stencil and Pynchon simply steering us away from the obvious or the possible? Is Pynchon suggesting that fiction (at least post-modern fiction) need not be obliged to offer up answers, that not every quest leads to its Holy Grail?I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that there's not just one V, but potentially many. Or at least, Young Stencil finds clues as to the existence of many candidates.Does it make any difference though? Does it matter who this particular woman, this V., is? Does the identity of any individual V. matter, when it is the \"what\", the abstraction of woman that Stencil might be seeking? Is he, like us, simply trying to understand womanhood in all of its complexity? Animation and AgitationWhatever the answer, Stencil's quest animates and energises him. Beforehand, he had been inanimate:\"His random movements before the war had given way to a great single movement from inertness to - if not vitality, then at least activity. Work, the chase...it was V. he hunted...\"Finding her: what then? Only that what love there was to Stencil had become directed entirely inward, toward this acquired sense of animateness...to sustain it he had to hunt V.; but if he should find her, where else would there be to go but back into half-consciousness? He tried not to think, therefore, about any end to the search. Approach and avoid.\"Sidney, on the other hand, was a spy and interrogator for the British Foreign Office whose function was to perpetuate the British Empire. He regarded V. as a threat to order. He viewed her as an agent of chaos who, in her different manifestations, always arrived at a time when the world was in a state of siege. She had an unerring ability to appear when the patriarchal world of Western Imperialism was under threat, whether by civil war, rebellion or revolution.In a way, V. represents an undivided, less phallocentrically structured world that unites the stability of land and the fluidity of the ocean, as well as Europe and Asia, West and East, Woman and Man.At a more generalised level, V might represent the relationship between the Animate and the Inanimate, between Life and Death, between Eros and Thanatos.The Woman QuestionIt's interesting that neither Stencil really wants to find a definitive answer to their particular woman question. They are males, and they can't see beyond an era during which men are firmly ensconced in the saddle of power and influence.There is no preparedness to share power or to improve relationships between the sexes.The nature of womanhood is therefore a question that remains unsolved at the end of the novel. Women remain a mystery to men, perhaps because they (men) don't try hard enough or don't really want to understand. They are unable to change their own perspective, so that they might listen and learn. They are content to live with the allure of mystery.In a way, what hope would there be for relationships if all of the mystery was obliterated?As Profane says towards the end of the novel:\"Offhand I'd say I haven't learned a goddamn thing.\"In a way, the unresolved concerns of the novel, from a male point of view, reflect Freud's plight:\"The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?\"What is to be Done?Both protagonists are selfish in their own masculine way. Profane seems to be oblivious to the issue of what women might want. Young Stencil is ambivalent. However, at least Pynchon is posing a question, which I hope he did not view as ridiculous.Ultimately, while it's arguable that \"V\" is a pro-feminist novel, I think Pynchon's view was that, as at the time of writing in 1963, there was no solution to the relationship question in view. There was, quite simply, more to be done. Perhaps the underlying truth is that, unless and until man understands the place of woman in the world, he will never understand his place next to woman.Some perspective and hope might come from McClintic Sphere, the jazz musician in the novel. His counsel, almost zen or beat, is to \"keep cool, but care.\" Don't worry too hard about it, just do it. But try to do it with love, not just lust and desire.Of course, the Women's Liberation Movement was only then starting to gather force. However, for all the good it has achieved since then, I think there still remains much to be done.Maybe at the level of couples it can be done, if we keep cool, but care.VERSE:Esther Got a Nose JobAfter years of childhood misery,Red-headed Esther got a nose job.One day the doctor removed her humpAnd returned it to her in a bottle.He thought it was such a great success,He gave her another hump for free.Pig's StoryTask force offGibraltarMoving forwardEn route To MaltaOn tar-colouredMediterraneanWaters underStars bloomingFat and sultry.The sort of nightWhen there's noTorpedoesOn the radarAnd Pig tellsUs all a storyAbout how he was Never caughtBehind the green doorThe night DoloresHeld an orgy.Nothing if Not ProfaneThey met mid-functionAt the Rusty Spoon.Although she's nowhereNear his age or size,He dreamed that he mightFind himself one nightAt the conjunctionOf her inner thighs.Voila, Vera Meroving![After and Mostly in the Words of Pynchon]Twin tendrils of sunlightIlluminated a crimson stainIn the courtyard of the Baroque plantation villa.A window swung openOn this fantastic dayTo reveal a striking woman In her forties, and otherwise, Barely clad, in a negligee,The hues of which werePeacock greens and blues,The fabric transparent,But not especially obscene.One Kurt Mondaugen,A crouching tiger, hid behindWrought iron curlicues, Astonished by his desireTo see and not be seen.If he waited long enough,A movement of the sun,This woman or the breeze,It might reveal to him,A voyeur, yes, it might rewardHis impatient gaze, his stare,With a glimpse of nipple,Her navel or some pubic hair.For Want of Godolphin[After and Mostly in the Words of Pynchon]Vera wanted GodolphinFor reasons he Could only guess.Her desire arose Out of nostalgia For the sensuous,Her appetiteKnew nothing at allOf nerves or heat,Or flesh or sweat,Or last night\u2019s caress,But was instead beholden Entirely to barren,Touchless memory.

The results are a mix of the same frustrations I had with the first 150 pages of Gravity\u2019s Rainbow (dropped thereafter), and a newfound appreciation for the most famous maximilist\u2019s skill for writing sentences of incredible inventiveness, rhythm, and frenetic lunacy.

It's that all-or-nothing, balls-to-the-wall debut effort that can either send a fledgling writer plummeting to dream-shattering depths with an effort that falls flat for any number of reasons or it can be the inaugural celebration all starry-eyed young scribes dare to hope for, that which heralds a staggering new talent to a canon populated by the many great wordslingers who've scribbled their way to well-deserved immortality. (For argument's sake, we'll work under the assumption that those flimsy flavor-of-the-month bestsellers that are so in vogue for their seemingly eternal 15 minutes will, in time, be forgotten and written off as yet another regrettable mistake born of groupthink's lapse in judgment while these truly remarkable feats of literature persist through the ages.)If one is to write what one knows, how daunting must it be to know so much about such a wide range of complicated topics -- minute historical details of a time one either never experienced or was simply too young to fully digest, regardless of youthful precociousness; engineering equations requiring mathematical acrobatics and a more than adequate grasp on physics; an insider's take on the naval experience; an innate understanding of how to perfectly mix high-minded concepts and lowbrow humor with a dash of poetic lyric -- and attempt to whittle it all down into a tome that won't crush potential readers under the weight of both the volume itself and the awe-inspiring ideas roiling within?The little we do know about literature's most elusive enigma points to pieces of Pynchon being flung along the narrative's parade route like confetti, adding flashes of biographical color to his intricately structured and beautifully written first novel that pits the animate against the inanimate and the internal self against the external veneer (and has the best-ever bonus of an Ayn Rand stand-in reduced to baby-talk in the presence of a pwecious widdle kittums-cat?). Aside from what can only be thinly veiled allusions to his Cornell days with Richard Fari\u00f1a and their cult of Warlock -- regarding the Generation of '37: \"And we did like to use Elizabethan phrases in our speech\"; \"A farewell celebration for Maratt on the eve of his marriage\"; \"Dnubietna leapt up on the table, upsetting glasses, knocking the bottle to the floor, screaming \"Go to, caitiff!\" It became the cant phrase for our \"set\": go to.\"; \"The pre-war University years were probably as happy as he described, and the conservation as \"good.\"\", to say nothing of the nod to a novel called Existential Sheriff -- the internal conflicts of the writer seem to be scattered throughout V. like a breadcrumb trail back to the source himself.Because Pynchon has be one conflicted dude. To be a notoriously private man juggling such derision for the spotlight with the compulsion to write for unseen but rabid fans, to churn out maddeningly, densely obscure works that are nevertheless guaranteed to meet both critical and commercial success (and increase sales of Excedrin in the following months), to posses such finely tuned right and left brains that he can be considered nothing less than an engineer-poet in his own right, to walk such a fine line between historical fictions and fictional histories -- is it any wonder that a man so in touch with dueling perspectives would build his first novel on the foundation of This \nv.\n That?"], ["\u201cSay a man is no good for anything but jazzing around.

Some set them loose in the streets, but most flushed them down the toilets.

Events seem to ordered into an ominous logic. He found paper and pencil and began to write the sentence in varying hands and type faces.\"As wartime paranoia, obsessiveness, elusiveness, and ambiguity all seem to be trademark characteristics of Thomas Pynchon's more epic narratives, it's easy enough for the reader to constantly stumble upon these intentionally scattered, meta-clues. Because his novels cover such a broad realm of subjects, while proposing a very unique, and humorous philosophy of history, the connections and transitions of V.'s hodgepodge of vignettes concerning a rich tapestry of characters struggling with both World Wars becomes more and more apparent as the \"story\" reaches its conclusion. Overall, this passage seems to function as an accurate metaphor for what it feels like to read V..With his eagerly anticipated seventh novel coming out in August of this year, V. now stands as one of his more accessible works, not to mention a fascinating example of his writing to look back upon in retrospect. Benny Profane is the archetypal Pynchonian schlemihl; an endearing protagonist, merely trying to get by as the rest of the world struggles obsessively with finding existential meaning in a universe full of closed systems. Tyrone Slothrop of Gravity's Rainbow would later act as a more carefully constructed version of this character. While it's true that not all of Pynchon's protagonists are slackers simply looking for a good time, they still function as tour guides who offer a more or less objective view of the events taking place. Even Herbert Stencil who exists as sort of an opposite of Profane, still shares a set of common characteristics, namely, humility or humanity. Call it what you will.We follow Profane after just getting out of the navy, living in New York. He falls in with a crowd of bohemians and drifters referred to as the Whole Sick Crew. This group resembles the social crowd in the Recognitions as well as characters belonging to any standard party scene in a beat novel (albeit far more tolerable, and acting as intentional parodies). Profane loafs around, finds a job hunting alligators in the sewers of New York. After shooting Stencil in the ass on one of his jobs more characters enter the picture, and we are introduced to Stencil's obsessive quest to find the elusive V., a sort of character that his father before him had been fascinated with. From there the narrative drifts back and forth between historical episodes set during the tail end of the 19th century, and the first half of the 20th. Pynchon's sympathies have always been directed at the marginalized, poor, oppressed, idealistic, liberal, etc. Even when he sketches portraits of his capitalist, fascist, hateful villains, he still manages to show their early development from wide-eyed, idealistic dreamer to avaricious monster, while avoiding a sort of idealistic bias because he presents the reader with the inherent weakness and hypocrisy of his liberal heroes just as well. Gaddis did the same thing with Wyatt Gwyon and Edward Bast, albeit both met more morbid, Faustian ends. V. functions as a metaphor for the late twentieth century, synthetic dehumanization, which has now become one of the more blatant examples of postmodern theorizing, but in 1961 this all must have read as more of a prescient idea. Several episodes in the book, as ambiguous as they are, sort of portray \"her\" as an unattainable object of desire. The fourth chapter entitled \"In Which Esther Gets a Nose Job\" is the earliest introduction to this theme. Naturally, Shoenmaker the man who performs this operation, later to become her insensitive lover is the first sort of villain to appear. Robots modeled after humans appear later on. Profane has a particularly profound and hilarious conversation with one of them. Pynchon utilizes this theme as a way of revealing how human beings desire this sort of mechanical, empty ontology, as a way of escaping their own horrific human condition. Once again, this is why Profane's character is so very important. He exemplifies the human spirit. In his lackadaisical approach to life, he achieves what is of the utmost importance to Pynchon. The ability to merely exist, and deal, regardless of whatever sort of astronomical terror will abound. Another reason why his own unique brand of historical fiction functions so well. What's more horrifying than the first half of the twentieth century?"], ["Thomas Pynchon... twenty six years old... first novel... twenty six... first novel... twenty six?Reads like The Adventures of Tintin on hallucinogens. Full of great comic scenes mixed with political espionage and paranoia amidst philosophical comments on the nature of politics, religion, death, time, sexuality and war. V. is undeniably complex and I can admit that there were moments of mind numbing confusion, but the book is so beautifully written that you just go for the ride. It's a haunting and frequently hilarious postmodern satire.V., to me, represents enlightenment, or finality. The quest itself is a long journey, hence the time and globe spanning nature of the story. The book itself is like a series of interconnecting short stories that sweeps through the majestic settings of New York, Paris, Malta, Egypt, Africa and Alexandria. The nature of V seems nurturing, motherly and caring in times of stress and suffering. Pynchon is operating on a metaphysical plain, where particles and matter can be seen and felt and the world is different from our own 20/20 vision. V is eventually seen, felt and experienced for those who are willing to take the necessary steps. Too many times are we fed little slices of fear from the characters who contemplate the nature of dying, growing old, separation from mans ignorance. These men in search of V are, in some way, in search of an ego death, to cure their fears in the face of God, a maternal presence of spirit, a being of upmost enlightenment.Obviously, there is so much more packed into this near 500 page novel, but that's what I got out of it first time around. Political theory is examined extensively through different countries and characters. Sexuality and youth seems prevalent within The Whole Sick Crew. There are some comments on the Christian Church and Christianity in general. Freudian psychology, science and mathematics pop up and colonialism is touched on as well.Or you could be a schlemihl and take Benny Profane's approach: \"I haven't learned a godammn thing.\""], ["Reading Thomas Pynchon's first novel is like plunging head first into a room with very little light. As the novel progresses, Pynchon regulates that light sometimes letting the reader see very clearly, narratively speaking, and other times enveloping the reader into near darkness.The two main characters are discharged Naval officer Benny Profane the self-described \"schlemiel\" and Stencil, the hunter of the elusive woman/idea known only as V. Though not exact opposites, their destinies do not intersect until the last part of the book. Profane's story is the more traditional narrative of the two as he passively wanders into alligator hunting, bar brawls, and an enigmatic security job. Profane with his friends known as \"The Whole Sick Crew\" could be Pynchon's alter ego and could be also an amalgamation of Naval and literary figures.The breadth of Pynchon's encyclopedic knowledge comes through with the emergence of Stencil as he wanders through time and multiple identities taking up his father's mission to find V. V wanders time and space (presumably though- its never clear) showing up in 19th century British Egypt, as a rat in a New York City sewer, and (in a very difficult chapter) as a \"bad preist\" mangled by children in the ruins of World War II. Pynchon's strokes are most broad in sub-stories regarding a German colony in South Africa and later in another chapter surrounding an impaled ballerina that entrances V.The connections are not often clear but the indictments of colonialism and war ring true. V is a challenging must-read postwar American whirlwind that remains consistent in its aggressively cubist tone."], ["It\u2019s a long distance from 1963 to 2009. The prior, V.\u2019s pub date. The later, when I thought maybe I had found perhaps the Pynchon key in Inherent Vice. I unlocked a bunch of great stuff with that key. Fantastic stuff. Stuff I dug. Stuff I got lost in. Against the Day. The newest thing. That one from the early \u201890s. I\u2019m still waiting to see if it fits Mason & Dixon. Gravity\u2019s Rainbow is next, but I\u2019ve already done 2/3 of that one and know I don\u2019t need no damn key for it. That key doesn\u2019t fit V..Well, at least it didn\u2019t key it open in the kind of immediate manner a million+ candle Klieg might have brightened it up. In other words, to my only slight disappointment, it\u2019s still the same damn novel it was back when I first tried my hand at it ages and ages ago with the mere assistance of Sam Adams. I don\u2019t think Sam Adams or any of his kin are helpful in the reading of V.. And probably not helpful for reading other Pynchon either. But that might just be my thing about disavowing any pretense about drugs of various sorts making entertainment products better. Drugs are entertaining enough on their own without the supplement of other artistic genres. But speaking of drugs of various sorts, what one should point out is that the distance between 1963 and 2009 is a length of 46 years. That\u2019s a pretty damn old Scotch. And I\u2019ve never been able to afford one. These later vintage\u2019d Pynchons have treated me very very well. And GR is being sweated with a great deal of anticipation by me. But this V. thing would require a third pass through to get itself cracked (or key\u2019d, depending on our metaphor here) by Yours Truly. And it doesn\u2019t need to be cracked by My Truly. You\u2019ll do just fine with it. I liked lots of stuff it in though. To be sure. There\u2019s a lot of that stuff that pops onto a wave length I\u2019ve tuned myself to and I really like it and there\u2019s other stuff where you know the sentences don\u2019t really follow from themselves so much the way I prefer my sentences to follow themselves. And they really don\u2019t need to. I really liked the way sentences followed themselves in Against the Day.On thing I really like about Pynchon, and a thing I noticed first when reading his 2006 novel, or maybe it was his 2009 novel, is that when you\u2019re reading along and you get this recollection of something that happened a while ago and you start paging backward to find that thing that happened a while ago and you realize that what happened a while ago happened only three pages back not thirty pages back like you had anticipated because that\u2019s how long back things like that usually happen in other novels you read. I had that experience with V. and really kind of appreciated it.I guess so the reason maybe why I\u2019m hemming and hawing is that I sort of failed to do that part where the reader picks up his part of the task and sews the whole damn thing into a unity. And I know that with someone like a Pynchon that unity is designed to be frustrated, but dammit! there\u2019s still a unity even within that fracturing. So the episodic stuff of course is de rigour these days and I dig it; making a novel out of a collection of short stories. Which is emphatically not what V. is. So with a bit of a synchronic approach I have no doubt that I\u2019d be able to zip this thing into a proper novelistic unity were I to read it a fourth and fifth time. (I really can\u2019t believe that in this post-structuralist age folks still think novels need to be written and read diachronically!) That\u2019s not the thing. The thing is, the thing that sort of bugged me or kicked me out or left me cold or didn\u2019t work for me was the way the sentences didn\u2019t exactly follow themselves. And thank the gods they didn\u2019t! because in 1961 The Novel needed some shaking up. And I\u2019m glad Pynchon shook it up. And I\u2019m glad he continued to write novels because I think he\u2019s written some of the Best Novels Ever. This is just not quite one of them. Maybe. Still and all, it\u2019s Pynchon so lots of good people will read it. Some will love it. Some will move on with great Begeisterung back to GR and M&D.

Even though we had all seen changes to her appearance recently. So beautiful, in fact, she could still get acting jobs without too much trouble. I could see this all ending soon because she was so morose that her mood permeated the whole movie set. She had become so lost, so indifferent to everything.

I couldn\u2019t afford to know Maria anymore. It was too debilitating, too disheartening, and inspired too many ugly thoughts of resentment. I wanted her melancholy to be left to song.

I no longer believe that.\"- Joan Didion, Play It As It Lays (Warning: This book is not to be read if suicidal, heavily medicated, driving, pregnant, or if you ever dream of walking out, alone, into the Nevada desert and not coming back. This book is pure existential peril. I remember when I was four being specifically afraid of our church's bathroom. I remember thinking the church was hallowed ground. Protected by some benign force. Nothing could get me in the church. I was safe. But I'd sit alone, in a stall, in the bathroom, and look at the white tile, white grout, and see the dark drain on the floor. I'd imagine all the terror that existed under the Church. The snakes that were waiting to crawl through the drain. The devil waiting to pull me into the unsanctified, unhallowed, shit-filled sewers. Yeah, this book made me think of that empty feeling, that feeling that even in safe places there were gaps, snakes, sewers, and darkness. This book also reminds me a bit of a combination of The Great Gatsby (but told by Daisy in California in the 1960s) and Less Than Zero (but told by Blair and Julian's parents). Actually, hell, the book could be F. Scott and Zelda in the 1960s. Anyway, I get a weird F. Scott and Bret Easton Ellis vibe, with perhaps just a little of Cormac McCarthy's cold Western, existential dread thrown in for flavor. It is one of those novels that is near perfect and also a razor blade under your tongue. It is dangerous and sharp and makes you nervous to find out what is next. There are snakes and cracks everywhere. Plants die. Memory fades. Nothing matters. Well, O.K. Joan Didion's prose matters. It matters a hell of a lot. Joan Didion's prose just might be one reason to keep living. To keep fighting. To keep turning the damn page and rolling the damn dice."], ["All right, let's discuss...It has been a month since I read this little ditty, and in that one month's time, it has managed to lose a star. Because honestly, I can't give a book 5 stars just because I couldn't put it down, just because it was a \"quick read.\" If that was the standard, every Jodi Picoult book I've ever read would be given 5 stars. When it comes down to it, while I did thoroughly enjoy this book, it isn't one that's going to stay with me through the ages. It isn't one I'm going to recommend to you or you or you. Although I'm sure you'd enjoy it. Or not. One of my GR friends told me that this book is a favorite of The National front man/songwriter Matt Berninger (I haven't been able to find corroboration of this on the interwebs, but I'll take your word for it). Loving The National like I do, I figured I'd give it a shot. I guess in retrospect this book feels a little self-indulgent to me. It's a story of a poor sad little actress with nothing but a lot of money and a lot of time on her hands. Ever met a beautiful girl with dead eyes and an expressionless face who doesn't care about anything or anyone? Well that's Maria Wyeth for you. Her world is a bleak one that you really shouldn't visit for very long, because she's the kind of girl who will suck the life right out of you. Unless you're a nihilist.

Poi entra in scena il narratore e la storia procede fino alla fine affidata alla sua voce, salvo qualche raro intermezzo in prima persona nel quale ritorna il punto di vista di Maria.Capitoli e capitoletti, salti avanti e indietro nel tempo, omissioni secondo il precetto hemingwayano dell\u2019iceberg, uno stile che unisce distanza e calore, sospensione e immersione, impalpabilit\u00e0 e profondit\u00e0, precisione ed evanescenza, uno stile che riesce nell\u2019impresa di essere, nella stessa pagina, gelido e struggente, sublime e durissimo.E allora la banalit\u00e0 della storia di Maria \u00e8 solo apparente: Maria \u00e8 un\u2019eroina che non dimenticher\u00f2 e ho gi\u00e0 voglia di ritrovare e leggere di nuovo, ancora.Didion rinuncia al contrasto tra bene e male: penetra l\u2019essenza intima dei personaggi, ognuno agisce seguendo delle motivazioni che sono in fondo comprensibili, ognuno \u00e8 l\u2019eroe della sua storia, non li rinchiude con il suo giudizio, hanno tutti un\u2019anima e sono capaci di redenzione, li racconta dalla \u2018giusta distanza\u2019, cos\u00ec lontano e cos\u00ec vicino, non li condanna e non li abbandona mai.Vita vissuta nel dolore e trascorsa nella sofferenza \u2013 un buco nero che risucchia e un vuoto enorme che consuma, nella costante attesa che arrivi quell\u2019amore di cui \u00e8 stata privata gi\u00e0 dall\u2019infanzia \u2013 trentuno anni, che sono tredici, ma anche gi\u00e0 cento \u2013 un\u2019esistenza sbagliata, un\u2019anima in fuga, una solitudine che circonda\u2026Maria piange molto, guida la sua Corvette per autostrade che portano nel deserto - pi\u00f9 che vivere, trascorre il tempo - parla poco e quando parla non dice nulla sul motivo delle sue lacrime - vorrebbe ma non pu\u00f2, vorrebbe crescere sua figlia che invece vive in una clinica per gravi malattie, vorrebbe tenere il figlio che ha in grembo ma deve perderlo, vorrebbe restare con Carter ma sa che \u00e8 inutile\u2026Lieve sospesa tenera delicata dura glaciale Maria, ti svegli al mattino con gli occhi gonfi e pesanti e ti chiedi se hai pianto nel sonno, vorresti prendere la vita come viene e stare al gioco ma proprio non ce la fai, non ti riesce, Maria, sei arrivata l\u00e0 dove nulla esiste e non hai pi\u00f9 voglia di giocare\u2026Grandissima, immensa Joan."], ["Joan Didion once said that writing is a hostile act. An imposition of the writer's sensibility on the reader's most private space.Play It As It Lays, published in 1970, slaps down at your soul's kitchen table and announces itself, not loudly, but in a voice that crawls under your skin, not really caring whether or not you want to see anyone, and lights a cigarette. In between noxious exhales, it tells you some version of the truth. Maria Wyeth's story, told in shifting first and close third person, is a 20th century existential tragedy, a sort of American The Stranger, in which Maria is Meursault and Los Angeles, Algiers; a psychiatric hospital stands in for a prison; there is a Nevada desert instead of a North African beach.At thirty-one, Maria is an actress of fading relevance with an impending divorce and a beloved four-year-old daughter in a care facility for the developmentally disabled (oh, my heart stuttered at the term 'retarded' used throughout the book). No one at the institution combs Kate's hair and the sad tangles Maria tries to smooth out during her visits are somehow emblematic of the chaos in her own life. The chaos isn't a busy one. It isn't an overflow of demands. It is the chaos of nothingness. \u201cBy the end of the week she was thinking constantly about where her body stopped and the air began, about the exact point in space and time that was the difference between Maria and other.\u201d Maria has become paralyzed by life, by the emptiness of her career and her relationships, where friends exchange each other as lovers as often as they exchange yesterday's soiled underwear for today's clean pair. She has had her insides scraped clean of a child conceived not in love, but in desperate boredom, and that act\u2014the back alley abortion so terribly, graphically evoked here, remember, this is the late 1960s\u2014is the ultimate creation of empty chaos. Maria finds solace traveling the freeways that criss-cross this City of Angels. Cruising the nothingness of the tarmac is the only time she feels safe and in control. Yes, this is a wrenching read. But so brilliant. The multiple points-of-view are deftly handled, the lightest touch bringing in this character or that. Didion's writing, with its echoes of Hemingway and McCullers, is spare and unflinching. The chapters are short and white space is left on the page, reflecting the white space in Maria's life that she tries to fill with alcohol, sex, acting, driving.Few novels have taken me so deeply inside one character, injecting me into her bloodstream, so that I breathe with her, see through her eyes. I love Maria, I hate her, I want to protect her, I want her out of my life. Time has done nothing to diminish the power of Maria's story, yet Play It As It Lays is a fascinating time capsule of feminist literature. Highly recommended."], ["Gambling, domestic violence, sexual abuse, drugs, alcohol, promiscuity, insanity, depression, snakes, suicide. These are all elements of Play It As It Lays, and much, much more. This is stark, wide-eyed, slap in the face prose that grabs the reader and holds you from beginning to end. It's not a pleasant read, no way. Watching Maria Wyeth's life unfold is like watching the proverbial train wreck that you can't look away from. Set in the 1960's, it's about Hollywood and the movie industry; it's about Las Vegas and gambling; but mostly it's about the life of a not so famous actress who is lost in the darkest corners of these places, and in the darkest corners of life. Joan Didion is at her best here, the writing is superb and it's definitely worthy of being called a modern classic. 4.5 stars."], ["Anyone still wondering why Dave Chappelle would walk out on a $50 million TV deal with Comedy Central to go into semi-retirement hasn't read Play It As It Lays by Joan Didion. All the answers are here.There is such a thing as a novel missing me at whatever point I'm at in my life. But there's also the kismet of a novel careening into me at the moment I'm crossing the same intersection the author is driving through. A month ago, I was reading an oral history of the '80s movie Masters of the Universe and in addition to insight on Dolph Lundgren or how a toy company destroys a successful product line, this comment from Chelsea Field, who played Teela in the movie, about co-star Courtney Cox stuck in my memory.\"Luck always plays a big role in everything. Being in the right place at the right time. Getting the right script for the right show. I\u2019ll tell you something funny. This must have been a little bit after Masters. And Courtney--she and I stayed in touch--she lived in Hollywood and I lived over in Burbank. So sometimes if I had an interview over in Hollywood or Beverly Hills, I\u2019d stop by her place and we\u2019d read lines together. I\u2019d go by her house and have a cup of tea before I hit my audition. And if it was a scene where I had to muster up tears or something she\u2019d just be looking at me like, \u201cOh my god, how do you do that? How do you do that, Chelsea?' And I\u2019d look at her and I\u2019d be like, 'you go to class. You\u2019re welcome to come to mine. Would you like to go with me?' And literally this was her answer: 'Oh no, I just have to get lucky once.' And I\u2019d be like, 'what? No, come to class.' And she\u2019d be like 'No, really, I just need to get lucky once.' That was her philosophy.\"Bully for Courtney Cox and Friends, but if life is a lucky bet, what happens to those who realize they don't have the energy to keep playing the game?Joan Didion's 1970 novella Play It As It Lays doesn't try to expose the dark side of life in the fast lane with salacious melodrama or thinly veiled celebrities acting out soap opera; she let Jacqueline Susann do that. Didion implodes that live fast/die young lifestyle into a numbing entropy. The novel is centered on and sometimes narrated by a woman telling her story from a place where mental health professionals present her with inkblots and her visitors have to sign in.My name is Maria Wyeth. That is pronounced Mar-eye-ah, to get it straight at the outset. Some people here call me \"Mrs. Lang,\" but I never did. Age: thirty-one. Married. Divorced. One daughter, age four. (I talk about Kate to no one here. In the place where Kate is they put electrodes on her head and needles in her spine and try to figure out what went wrong.)Maria was born and raised in Nevada, the only child of a gambling father with great expectations and big dreams in zinc mines, cattle ranches, ski resorts or motels he bought or won but that never paid off big. Maria grew up in a town her father owned called Silver Wells (pop: 28) with her mother and her father's business partner. Graduating from high school in Tonopah with her mother's looks and her father's spirit, Maria moves to New York for acting lessons. In the beginning, Maria's gamble pays off in ways her parents could only have dreamed of. A successful modeling career segues into the lead role in a movie called Angel Beach, in which Maria played a girl raped by a motorcycle gang. The movie is a big hit. Next comes marriage to her director, an up-and-coming talent named Carter Lang, and a multitude of glamorous acquaintances, most of them toxic, including her husband's producer BZ and BZ's wife, Helene. With a disabled daughter she cannot care for and an estranged husband away on location, Maria spends much of her time driving the freeways of Los Angeles in her Corvette. When she feels like talking, she's contradicted. She tells her agent she wants to work, he tells her she doesn't. She tells her husband she wants to give marriage another try, he tells her she doesn't act like it. Opportunities come and go. Life begins to pass Maria by while she stands watching it like a film extra.Play It As It Lays is the first book I've read where nearly every sentence could be the first sentence of the book.-- So they suggested that I set down the facts, and the facts are these.-- What happened was this: I looked all right (I'm not telling you I was blessed or cursed, I'm telling a fact, I know it from all the pictures) and somebody photographed me and before long I was getting $100 an hour from the agencies and $50 from the magazines which in those days was not bad and I knew a lot of Southerners and faggots and rich boys and that was how I spent my days and nights.-- In the first hot month of the fall after the summer she left Carter (the summer Carter left her, the summer Carter stopped living in the house in Beverly Hills), Maria drove the freeway.-- \"Tell me who you've seen,\" she said.-- At four that afternoon, after a day spent looking at the telephone and lighting cigarettes and putting the cigarettes out and getting glasses of water and looking at the telephone again, Maria dialed the number.One of the pleasures in any novel is discovering an author who has possession of a skeleton key that unlocks secrets. John Steinbeck has that ability for me. So does Elmore Leonard, in more subtle and sly ways. Joan Didion, the political journalist, author, screenwriter and wife of late novelist John Gregory Dunne, taps into that reservoir of hidden currents here. Didion wasn't reporting anything new; Maria Wyeth's meltdown was preceded by many starlets of the '20s, '30s and '40s but since the publication of the novel, has recurred over and over again -- for men as well as women - on the level of a Biblical parable. Because Play It As It Lays doesn't conform to a linear progression of cause and effect -- Maria refuses to address why the things that have happened to her happened to her -- Didion is free to roam where she pleases and strike where she pleases, jumping in at different stages in Maria's life or telling episodes from different perspectives. The novel is minimal, thrilling, brutally honest, abnormally perceptive and breathlessly good. Anyone still wondering why Dave Chappelle would walk out on a $50 million TV deal with Comedy Central to go into semi-retirement, or what's going on in Hollywood, can get the short answer in this clip from Chappelle's visit to Inside the Actor's Studio in November 2008.

I say the first minute because upon seeing Michael look up at the camera with yellow eyes and fangs she threw her hands up, screamed at the top of her lungs, ran from the room, into her room, ran back into the room (still screaming), out of the room, back in and buried her head into the safety of my comforting lap (still screaming). Now I realize this is most people's reaction to seeing Micheal's post '90s decomposing flesh face but for the little princess it was a little traumatizing. Since the \"day o' horror\" I have had to create a new \"pretty\" story every night \"to get THAT face\" out of her head. I've created my own little fantasy stories, catered to the princess, filled with violet unicorns, fairy wings, rainbows and on one interesting night a humpback whale, mermaid and her own underwater kingdom. These tales of bubble-gum and rainbows brought me to this book. Sometimes when life is filled with demonic faces that haunt your night you need the pretty stories to even it out. OR in adult-land when life is filled with beige and blah you need this book. It was achingly empty and dark. The depravity of the characters brought out feelings and emotions within me that I needed to feel. It was rich with the feelings that make you feel alive just by your own juxtaposition to the toxic characters. Reading this was akin to reading an Adrienne Rich poem. I really liked it.  \"I know what \"nothing\" means, and keep on playing.\""], ["This book is simply brilliant. The fatalism of it's heroine, Maria Wyeth, is absolutely heart-wrenching as she slowly grows more and more tired of life. Didion is a surgeon, each sentence like a scalpel cutting away a cancerous tumor. No one can match her for brutal honesty. While it's a very quick read at just over 200 pages, it deals a swift but heavy blow."], ["So that she would not have to stop for food she kept a hard-boiled egg on the passenger seat of the Corvette.

Some people ask. I never ask.Well surprisingly enough Joan Didion. And these words set in motion the inevitable direction that this book is going to take.When Didion wrote this book, she was thirty-five and had moved a few years before with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, to Los Angeles where they were to spend twenty years working in the film industry;The review on the back cover portrays quite succinctly the atmosphere of the setting of this book:A ruthless dissection of American life in the late 1960s, \u201cPlay It as It Lays\u201d captures the mood of an entire generation, the emptiness and ennui of contemporary society reflected in spare prose that both blisters and haunts the reader.This was the period when the pill for contraceptive purposes had been in place for nearly a decade.

Wyeth is a thirty-one year old, somewhat failed actress, married to, and then divorced from Carter, a film director. She is indeed cool at times in trying to keep her emotions in check but nevertheless she fails miserably.When the book begins, she is in some kind of psychiatric hospital and prior to this her friends had been so concerned for her safety, that when an intolerable situation occurred she inevitably turned up there. I found her entire lifestyle terrifying. Speed on the freeway was of major importance to her \u2013 she drove to places like someone demented, like a bat out of hell; it seemed that she had to keep the adrenaline flowing. Then her mood could unaccountably turn to another extreme with the realisation that life was futile and meant nothing. She cried a lot and on one occasion bled a lot. That was a mesmerising part of this book. Sex came and went and was all rather meaningless. The relationship with her husband Carter ended in divorce and I\u2019m unsure who left whom but their situation was dire. Constant attempts at reconciliation failed as there was such hatred it was impossible to overcome.There\u2019s a rather strange relationship between Maria, Carter and BZ (bisexual movie producer, BZ -an abbreviation for benzodiazepines, sedative drugs) and his wife Helena. I was unsure what was really going on there. Maria\u2019s childhood was rather unusual. Her father had been a gambler, winning a town \u2013 Silver Wells - that began with twenty-eight individuals but was soon zero. As he had gambled away his Reno house, he recalled that he owned a town and so they lived there.Kate, Maria\u2019s four year old daughter is in a clinic with an imprecise disorder. Carter was responsible for her being there and Maria is trying to get her out. She plays only for Kate.My feelings towards Maria and BZ changed dramatically from confusion and coldness to a sudden sense of place in regard to admiration for their identical views on existence on this earth. It could be seen that they had this kind of symbiotic relationship:\u201cI never expected you to fall back on style as an argument.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not arguing.\u201d\u201cI know that.

Nevertheless this has certainly put me on track to read more of Didion\u2019s works, both fiction and non-fiction.

The Names is set up, brilliantly, like a thriller. An American in Athens with a shadowy job, a risk analyst for a company that insures multinational companies against the hazards of political upheaval, and part of an international subculture of equally shadowy executive figures benefiting from middle eastern turmoil hears about the existence of a death cult in the region of Greece where his separated wife and son are temporarily living. She is a volunteer at an archaeological dig. The opening hundred pages of The Names is dazzling, especially there\u2019s some of the best travel writing you\u2019ll find anywhere in literature. Everyone in the novel is about to fly somewhere else. Teheran, India, Beirut, Cairo, Cyprus, Turkey, Kuwait, Pakistan, Jordan, Zaire. Places that aren\u2019t safe, places where there\u2019s money to be made. There\u2019s the sense most of these people are parasites. They are people who pride themselves on their sophistication. \"This is where I want to be. History. It\u2019s in the air. Events are linking all these countries. What do we talk about over dinner, all of us? Politics basically. That\u2019s what it comes down to. Money and politics. And that\u2019s my job.\" And yet, ironically, the novel begins to backslide more and more towards the primitive. It drops any aspiration towards plot and becomes more and more esoteric. It becomes a novel about language. About the roots of language and the darkness language seeks to edge us away from. A narrative about narrative itself. And almost everything narrated is second-hand, a distillation of the original experience. We learn about people and things twice, \u201cthe second time in memory and language\u201d. If you\u2019ve tried DeLillo before and haven\u2019t warmed to him then probably you won\u2019t like this much either. Reasons? Firstly all the characters talk in the same voice and are all without exception, a child included, more eloquent and intelligent than anyone we\u2019re generally likely to meet. They are all at one with the general cadence and fabric of the text itself. Secondly, DeLillo is very much an impressionist; he\u2019s not a realist. And this is among his most impressionist novels. Libra and White Noise are probably as close as he gets to realism. And thirdly DeLillo is one of the all time great stylists; he can write sentences which take your breath away; but he doesn't really do storytelling in any accepted form. And this is even more true of The Names than most of his other books. It\u2019s astonishing this novel was published in 1986 because it predicts much that has happened in the Middle East so far this century. The death cult can even be seen as an eerie forerunner of ISIS- not Islamic or political in nature but backward looking, primitive and punitive in its simplistic dichotomies, its adherence to misrepresented ancient texts. I can\u2019t say I understood exactly what The Names was getting at. As a novel it remains a bit of a blur in my mind. But the writing at times is absolutely stellar."], ["Designated DriverHave you ever got the impression that, when an author started a book, they had no idea where it would go or how it would end?That they would just slide into the front seat and let the book take over?This is not such a book.Instead, I got the impression that DeLillo was so firmly ensconced in the driver\u2019s seat here that he wouldn\u2019t have got out if a crew of firemen arrived to rescue him from his burning vehicle.It was win or die, so he had to pull out all stops.When he started, he had the finish line in sight, and when he arrived at the finish line, he made sure that he had come full circle back to where he had started.Seventh Heaven\u201cThe Names\u201d was DeLillo\u2019s seventh novel.His previous works had enjoyed modest critical success, but hadn\u2019t really made any commercial impact.This book is generally regarded as the one that launched his career.Originally published in 1982, I first read it in 1987, when it was repackaged after the relative success of his next novel, \u201cWhite Noise\u201d.It is still the DeLillo book by which I judge all others, but it\u2019s also the one that I recommend as an entry point for anyone who hasn\u2019t read him yet.While it deals with later concerns like cults, terrorism, modernity, security and the plight of America in the world, it does so in a more overtly humanist manner.These issues are the backdrop for the very personal frailties and stories of the protagonists. First Among ProtagonistsThe narrator is an American, James Axton, who is based in Athens at the beginning of the 1980\u2019s.Someone who is quite capable of writing fiction and screenplays, he makes a living writing reports and memos about the economic, social and political situation in the Middle East for the North East Group, a corporation that issues insurance policies against the risk of terrorist activities.He has to identify and assess the risk of terrorist activity, which brings him and his employer to the attention of the CIA.At heart, he is a lonely sad expatriate, a man living apart.He isn\u2019t writing the works he is capable of.He is estranged from his wife and nine year old son, his native America and the Greek society around him.He survives in a world of similarly jaded expatriates who have made Athens a European base for business sorties into the Middle East.Like his own, the other expatriate marriages are stressed and vulnerable to adulterous affairs.This is very much a late twentieth century European version of \u201cThe Quiet American\u201d.The Poor Norseman and the Acropolis At the beginning, James defines himself in relation to the Acropolis.He is overawed and daunted by this renowned, exalted building perched on a somber rock and surrounded by tourists.He rationalises that he prefers to wander in a modern city, even though it might be imperfect and blaring compared with the beauty, dignity, order and proportion of the Acropolis.He personalises it as a monument to doomed expectations, as if its existence will confront him with his own inadequacy and the madness of the society around him.Like his peers, James constructs an elaborate sense of self-importance around him that he uses to conceal his loneliness and unhappiness.He is not the stuff of a typical fictional American hero, yet bit by bit he pulls down the construct around him and by the end seems to have seized control of his life.In order to do so, he has to learn from the tumultuous people and events around him.The Women in His Life\u201cThe Names\u201d is not a sexually explicit novel, but it does bounce around in a slyly erotic manner.Over the course of the novel, James negotiates comfort from many of the women in his community, whether married or not.Of the women he flirts with, some appear to be good long term friends, some appear to be content with a Platonic attraction and one, Janet Ruffing, a banker\u2019s wife and freelance belly dancer, he imposes himself on so insistently that I can\u2019t think of any better word for it than rape.It is strange that this last relationship almost goes unremarked upon. If it had occurred in a Romansbildung of a much younger character, perhaps his conduct would have been excusable in the name of fiction.However, it is almost as if this rape is intended to symbolize a growing capacity to assert himself within his overall getting of wisdom.This, for me, is the one major, but inexplicable, failure of tone and sensitivity in the novel.Owen Brademas, Epigraphic Detective Perhaps the most important mentor for James is his wife, Kathryn\u2019s, employer, an archeologist and epigrapher.In the twilight of his professional life, he is fascinated by language and its origins in marks, inscriptions, symbols, characters, letters and alphabets.He examines how these systems developed, almost as attempts to make a mark or impression on life, then as a method of recording details of grain, livestock, possessions and wealth.So language wasn\u2019t just concerned with communication within a tribe, but was a major tool, a lingua franca, designed to facilitate trade and commerce between tribes.The Significance of LanguageTo enable communication, alphabets and words had to have commonly accepted meanings and significance.A sign must have a signifier and a signified.An image must have a connection that is commonly recognised.This recognition passes from person to person, but also from generation to generation.Images and words convey the memories of one generation to another generation.Language keeps alive memories and experiences and wisdom.Therefore, language became an important repository for social and cultural meaning.The Language of PowerLanguage has always been more than a vehicle for individual or personal expression.Like the Acropolis, language is a social construct that has its own beauty, dignity, order and proportion.Unlike the Acropolis, it is a vehicle for a dynamic relationship between people.Just as language connects people and things or people and other people, it defines, manages and controls the relationship between the two.It allows people to discover the world and, having done so, it allows them to relate to it.However, inevitably, the relationship involves elements of power, control and persuasion.Thus, it is the fundamental mechanism through which politics operates.Which means that it can be abused.Within mass society, language becomes an instrument of oppression.The Language of ReligionThis abuse extends beyond the civil sphere.Starting with the crucible of the Middle East, there is inevitably a role for language within spirituality and religion.It connects people and God. However, it also defines Good and Evil, and defines our relationship with them.We cannot engage with Good and Evil, except though the vehicle of language.It shapes and moulds our responses to moral issues, especially in emotional terms.Owen tells Kathryn:\"Masses of people scare me. Religion. People driven by the same powerful emotion. All that reverence, awe and dread.\"And, as if by explanation, he states:\"I\u2019m a boy from the prairie.\"Like James in awe of the Acropolis, he believes he has a simple worldview. He\u2019s self-contained and not given to surrendering his independence to the powers that be.He believes that you can lose your individuality in a crowd:\"Was it a grace to be there, to lose oneself in the mortal crowd, surrendering, giving oneself over to mass awe, to disappearance in others?\" Later on, Frank Volterra, a filmmaker who is captivated by and interested in filming Owen\u2019s story, says:\"It is religion that carries a language. The river of language is God.\"Language is a facility granted to us by God.By the same token, language is a container that holds and transmits that reverence, awe and dread.So, ultimately, language has positive and negative aspects.And \u201cThe Names\u201d is DeLillo\u2019s chosen vehicle for exploring them.Reducing Language to WritingSpoken language is just sounds. In order to speak or communicate, we must make a noise:\"I liked the noise, the need to talk loud, to lean into people\u2019s faces and enunciate.\"Yet, too much noise, too little order, too much randomness, and the noise becomes a cacophony of incomprehension.Language must be \u201csubdued and codified\u201d (again, the concept uses the language of power and control).DeLillo first uses this term when he reveals that Owen has been thinking of the English archaeologist Rawlinson, who wanted to copy and analyse the inscriptions on the Behistun Rock, which contained three separate languages, Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian.This enterprise allows him to work at the level of meta-language.Until the stone is deciphered, until the code is broken, it is just a riddle.Rawlinson must apply intelligence to the task, in order to discover the intelligence within or at least on the surface of the rock.He cannot establish a connection with the past, he cannot create a community, until he has managed to decipher the code.Ironically, DeLillo ensures that all the time Owen is being watched by an intelligence community of one description or another, whether it is James or the CIA or the local security forces.\"All the noise and babble and spit of three spoken languages had been subdued and codified, broken down to these wedge-shaped marks. With his grids and lists the decipherer searches out relationships, parallel structures. What are the sign frequencies, the phonetic values? He wants a design that will make this array of characters speak to him.\"An Array of CharactersEarlier, Owen mentions that the word \u201ccharacter\u201d comes from a Greek word, which means \u201cto brand or to sharpen\u201d or in the case of the noun \u201can engraving or branding instrument\u201d.In English, he points out that the same word is used not just for a mark or symbol (like a letter in the alphabet), but a person in a story.You could extrapolate that those original marks or symbols might actually have represented real people.Interestingly, the same English word is used to describe the quality or characteristics of a person, their \u201ccharacter\u201d and the \u201cmark\u201d they will make on the world.So language is a tool that enables us to tell stories, to create our own worlds and to populate them with people.In more advanced societies, story-telling takes the form of novels and film.Just as Rawlinson and Owen are trying to decipher riddles, the challenge for an author like DeLillo is to create \u201ca design that will make this array of characters speak to him\u201d.Frank Volterra follows in Owen\u2019s footsteps, trying to make a film that will capture and describe the story.Fiction and film are designed to make a lasting impression, they are the wedge-shaped marks scratched out by this generation that future generations will examine to learn about us and themselves.Naming NamesAt the simplest level, the concept of the \u201cNames\u201d is that language consists of giving \u201cnames\u201d to things or images or signs. But we need codes to understand the allocation of a name to a sign.Many of these codes were carved in stone, intended to last a thousand years.Just as these codes, when broken, reveal their meaning, we also learn that many of the inscriptions were codifications or codes of law and usage that were intended to regulate and manage trade and commerce.They supply guidance, directions and commandments as to how things should and must be done.Originally, they were primarily intended to work for the benefit of merchants and consumers.However, language took on a life of its own as a tool of power and control.You could even speculate that language is the power and control and that people are the vehicle it uses to achieve its purpose.The risk in all codes and laws is that they become too prescriptive and inflexible.They can ossify or, ironically given their origin, turn to stone.So there comes a point when the code attracts not awe, but resistance.A Cult Defying LanguageIn DeLillo\u2019s hands, the resistance comes from a cult of fundamentalists.They see language as an instrument of oppression and they begin to attack it by killing people.Obviously, most people are the carriers of language, so if you murder someone you destroy their capacity to use language.Yet, this seems so arbitrary. It makes an enemy of everyone.Owen sets out to find \u201ca pattern, order, some sort of unifying light\u201d to explain their conduct.Owen and James discover that all of the victims are old and infirm, (almost) ready to die, some having lost their memory and therefore their connection with the past, themselves and those around them.Kathryn even speculates that the cult is sacrificing these people to God as a plea for divine intercession in a world that they believe has gone wrong.Perhaps, they are a doomsday cult trying to forestall doomsday?Occult PracticesOwen questions it, because he has met them and doubts whether they worship a divine being:\"They weren\u2019t a god-haunted people.\"They are interested in \u201cletters, written symbols, fixed in sequence\u201d.He suspects that they want to return to a simpler world, where symbols are purely derived from nature, where letters are mere pictographs representing only \u201ceveryday objects, animals, parts of the body\u201d.Frank learns that they oppose the order of language, the way it has become both law and order:\"The alphabet is male and female. If you know the correct order of letters, you make a world, you make creation. This is why they will hide the order. If you will know the combinations, you make all life and death.\"Take Your Name and PlaceJames learns that the cult chooses victims whose initials match the first letter of each word in a place-name.\"The letters match...Name. Place-name.\"They are placing people in the real world. Then killing them.The act of murder silences the victim. Owen learns from a former cult member:\"When we came into the Mani [peninsula], we knew we would stay. What is here? This is the strength of the Mani. It does not suggest things to us. No gods, no history. The rest of the Peloponnese is full of associations. The Deep Mani, no. Only what is here. The rocks, the towers. A dead silence. A place where it is possible for men to stop making history. We are inventing a way out.\"A Cult with No NamesThe cult appears to be a genuine cult with no name. They will not reveal it to anyone.Ironically, James finds one incidence of where they have created their own marking.It\u2019s a rock inscribed with the words \u201cTa Onomata\u201d, which he suspects might be the name of the cult.\"Do you know what it means? \u201cThe Names\u201d.\"They define themselves by the name of their enemy.By marking the name of the enemy on pottery and smashing it, they will bring about their enemy\u2019s death. And perhaps their own.\"You...want to hurt your enemy, it is in history to destroy his name\u2026the same harm [as if] you cut his throat.\" The Politics of Empire DeLillo treats language as a symbol of a process that subdues and codifies people.It can also have a special place in the subjugation of peoples, the politics of empire:\"We can say of the Persians that they were enlightened conquerors\u2026they preserved the language of the subjugated people. Is this the scientific face of imperialism? The humane face? Subdue and codify?\"In the contemporary world, DeLillo\u2019s subjects include \u201cmoney, politics and force\u201d, the topics of James\u2019 reports and memos.\"For a long time, [Greek] politics have been determined by the interest of great powers. Now it is just the Americans who determine.\"Americans \u201clearn comparative religion, economics of the Third World, the politics of oil, the politics of race and hunger\u201d.They have learned that \u201cpower works best when it doesn\u2019t distinguish friends from enemies.\u201dLike language, this imperial approach is destined to attract resistance, in the form of terrorism.\u201cThe Names\u201d was written at the time of the Iran hostage crisis in 1980.Terrorism has become more powerful and refined since then, but there is much in DeLillo\u2019s novel that preempts both real world politics and the concerns of his future novels. Even James realises that, \"If America is the world\u2019s living myth, then the CIA is America\u2019s myth.\"Ultimately, \"The final enemy is government.\"The Coded Matters of IntimacyIf the novel was just concerned with global politics, it would be enough.However, DeLillo extends his gaze to personal and family relationships.James is no hero, but he does embark on a hero\u2019s journey, learning from others and his own discoveries.It\u2019s a collective effort that reconnects him to his family.When we first meet him, he is alienated, although nowadays we would probably diagnose him as depressed.Deep down he seems like quite a charmer, but he is a \u201creluctant adulterer\u201d who has \u201can eye for his friends\u2019 wives and his wife\u2019s friends\u201d, just two of \u201c27 Depravities\u201d he lists about himself.He has failed to pay attention, failed to concentrate, failed to focus, failed to treat his family seriously, he has lost the words needed to make a family life happen.Ultimately, as he learns about language, he rediscovers the language of love.But first he must acknowledge that he has made a mistake.Kathryn\u2019s \u201cevery dissatisfaction, mild complaint, bitter grievance\u201d was right, although it is amusing that he can only see this retrospectively.He can only acknowledge that Kathryn was \u201cretroactively correct\u201d (i.e., \u201cshe is right now, but I was right at the time.\u201d I must try this out on my wife, F.M. Sushi, next time I apologise).Memorising the FutureThis retroactivity involves memory.Once again, James is influenced by Owen, who believes that memory is: \"... the faculty of absolution. Men developed memories to ease their disquiet over things they did as men. The deep past is the only innocence and therefore necessary to retain.\"It is a reminder that we have been good and that we can be good again.Language is the beginning of doing good:\"This is what love comes down to, things that happen and what we say about them.\"It\u2019s not enough to be awestruck by the wonders of the world, because we will sometimes encounter what his nine-year old son, Tap, describes as something \u201cworse than a retched nightmare. It was the nightmare of real things, the fallen wonder of the world.\u201dJames finds Tap\u2019s mangled words exhilarating: \"He made me see them new again, made me see how they worked, what they really were. They were ancient things, secret\", [but most importantly] \"reshapable\".We have to add some love, some light, some colour of our own.Acropoliptic VisionWhen James finally conquers his fear of the Acropolis, this is what he has come to realise.There are crowds, tourists, families, none of them alone, making a noise, all speaking their own language, \"one language after another, rich, harsh, mysterious, strong\". \"This is what we bring to the temple, not prayer or chant or slaughtered rams. Our offering is language.\"Ultimately, this is DeLillo's offering to us: language that is rich, harsh, mysterious, strong."], ["An intelligent, mature and often quite complexing work from DeLillo who I am a fan, this is set mostly in Greece which centres on an American risk analyst staying in Athens who is slowly drawn to the workings of a mysterious 'language cult' who are obsessed with ancient alphabets and seem to be behind a number of unexplained murders. While described as an exotic thriller it's so much more than that, and tends to sway away from any conventional plot to focus more on deep and precise character studies where issues of politics, cultural differences, loyalty, mythology, history and religion are bought into question. The observation throughout is of a very high standard but this tends to be both it's strength and weakness as there are many long winded conversations rich in detail which seem to go on forever and can get slightly frustrating leaving a feeling of just where everything is going. There is an eerie menace hanging in the air at times which I give credit for and on the whole he creates a strangely perplexing work that is intriguing rather than exciting. Many will be turned off as it requires time and patience and does leave more questions than answers. but I found it slowly absorbing and very well written."], ["Vaulting into eternity ... well perhaps not that highPushing the logic of hippiedom to its extreme, The Names suggests an end point - a nihilistic cult whose reason for being is to murder people whose initials correspond to the names of their locations. Bizarre, senseless, and intentionally without benefit to anyone. Helter Skelter played out in the regions that produced Western civilization, Greece and the Middle East. This cult fascinates James, a member the international financial gang whose roles are just about as rational as those of the cultists; and Frank, a film-maker, who wants to exploit as much irrationality as he can; and Owen, an academic who is unaccountably swept into the spiritual maelstrom of the Indian branch of the cult. Who can blame any of them? Their lives are an empty wandering without any conscious intention. Only the bizarre and senseless seems to make any sense. They obsessively move toward the cult but with nothing as directive as desire. The cult is a kind of tar baby, an inert web, that traps the protagonists for no point whatsoever.Everyone sounds the same in The Names, men, women, children, adults, bankers and archaeologists. Without 'he saids, she saids' it is often difficult to follow conversations. And since DeLillo doesn't do reflective internal dialogue except to confuse, it's also difficult to decipher motivations. Why do couples stay together, or not? Why do the men persist in their questionable businesses and resist returning to America? What attracts his characters to the distributed cult? DeLillo's not saying.Then there are the literary non-sequiturs. \"It never happens until it happens again. Then it never happened.\" Does this phrase have meaning? \"There was something artless and trusting in the place despite the street meanders, the narrow turns and ravens.\" I should think artlessness was implied by such a scene, which has no obvious connection to trust or distrust. Or \"In this century, the writer has carried on a conversation with madness. We might almost say of the twentieth century writer that he aspires to madness.\" This would certainly qualify for the Pseuds Corner section of Private Eye.My problem is that I think I share much of DeLillo's experience of the world and his gripes about corporate life, American interference in the world and the casual destructiveness of global finance. But I can't place myself anywhere in his writing. I get lost, as if I've become one of his rootless, bored, superficial characters who is \"vaulting into eternity.\" I suppose this is his intention. If so I'm left with the question 'Why?'."], ["\u201cI move past the scaffolding and walk down the steps, hearing one language after another, rich, harsh, mysterious, strong.

Our offering is language.\u201d \u2015 Don DeLillo, The NamesFor 4/5 of this book Don DeLillo was surfing in Mao II, White Noise, Underworld, and Libra territory. I was jamming. Words. Names. Cults. Terrorism. It was fantastic. But there was 1/5 (yup, math works) of this book right before the last few pages where DeLillo just let go of the narrative kite. It was like I was meditating and almost ready to escape the wheel with this book Don, and at the very end your chanting just put me to sleep. Still, 4/5 of this book rocked. And maybe it was me and not you Don. Maybe. I'll review tomorrow some more. Maybe I'll even re-read the last 60+ pages. See if I can detect God or meaning in those words. Maybe I'm just tired. Maybe I'm not thinking right. Tomorrow, I'll look at this again with fresh eyes.[Post Rest] I'm still not ready to make it five stars. It doesn't quite belong to the same orbit as those DeLillo novels listed above. HOWEVER, there was something visceral about this novel that grabbed me (and yes lost me for a bit). I remember going to high school in Turkey in the late 80s. Hell, Kurdish Marxist terrorists inadvertently saved my life (long, but true story). DeLillo's novel is an archeology or words, a history of terror, a hunt for God and the economics of understanding. It is at times a frustrating prose poem and at times glorious burp in a cave. It gives serious echoes of MAO II. It is infinitely quotable. It whirls like a dusty dervish on the sacred Name of God, reducing memory and history to the initials of the Great unknown."], ["Don DeLillo gets major points for style. Seriously, he's one of the all-time greatest American prose stylists; his knack for catching the rhythms of (educated, disaffected) speech is uncanny, as is his always-apt use of the interrogative-with-no-question-mark, which I've not seen effectively used in most writing but hear in speech every day. And he always picks good themes, if you want to call them that: technology, language, consumerism, intellectualism, violence, etc.So why is it that he so rarely manages to write a compelling novel? I loved White Noise, but was very let down by The Body Artist and later Cosmopolis. And now this. The plot drags, or there is no plot, or the plot is ambiguous, or it's ambiguous whether or not there's a plot. Resolutions are promised, promises broken.But then, why the four stars? Well, I would say this was notably better than the other two I mentioned, if only because it's set in Greece, but also I think because it was written BEFORE White Noise and his other really good stuff, though I couldn't exactly say why that helps. As I said before, the prose style is near-perfect, which is nice. And the novel does raise some interesting questions, although I won't mention them here. Ultimately it comes down to this:\"A man finishing a peach tossed the pit into the sidecar of a motorcycle as it turned the corner where he happened to be standing. The timing was perfect, the toss deceptively casual. What rounded out the simple beauty of the thing was the fact that he did not look around to see who noticed.\"There's a lot of that. If you like it, you'll probably like The Names. If not, skip it."], ["I can't figure out what to write about this book. This review does have a soundtrack though, it's a Leonard Cohen song, listen to it here. With the exception of The Players, I feel like I'm through with what I think of as the 'early Delillo'. Next up is White Noise, which I feel is vastly overrated but which I'm going to give another try, and then there is Libra, a departure from what I normally think of Delillo but a pretty awesome historical novel and then his novel about a Pynchon-like author, Mao II which leads to his novel that probably begs comparison to Pynchon just for it's sheer size, Underworld. So, being done with the 'early' period and moving into his 'major' period (after Underworld I think there is another period, but I'm not sure how to classify it yet), I think it's safe to say that his early novels (with the exception of Ratner's Star, and maybe The Players (since I haven't read it yet)) are pretty damn satisfying. A definite highlight of American Literature written roughly during my lifetime. I don't really know what to write about this particular book. On the sentence level is is stunning. Delillo writes sentences and dialogue like John Woo filmed violence (in his Hong Kong films, ignore that American shit). Overly stylized and very artificial but so beautiful that the lack of realism is an afterthought to the enjoyment. On the bigger level, I'm not sure if this novel is successful. I never quite got what Delillo was doing in the novel, I could make out the various themes, but I'm not sure exactly where he was going sometimes with their development. But, even if the total narrative wasn't entirely successful (to me) or if I thought he could have done more with some of the threads, and maybe been more explicit about other things in the novel, on the whole I really enjoyed it. Each page was great, it's just sometimes thinking about how all the pages went together that I would start to scratch my head and wonder if I really was getting what I was supposed to get. The song I linked to above really doesn't have anything to do with this particular novel of Delillo's but it started to play on my Spotify thing tonight and I was struck by how similar it was to many of the reoccurring themes that pop-up in Delillo's books. New York. The Desert. The longing for place. It's not a direct, oh my god this is just like Delillo novels, but more like wow, I never noticed this before but this song sort of catches the feeling I get from quite a few of these novels. DFW update? I didn't get any feeling of there being connections between Infinite Jest and this book. Maybe there were some loose thematic connections, but they are all things that are fairly common Delillo things and nothing in particular stood out in this book. Maybe my theory is starting to run out of steam, but I think there are some interesting connections between the first few Delillo novels and DFW. Maybe sometime later this year I'll commit myself to giving Infinite Jest a third read and try to incorporate some of them into how I approach the book (the first time would have been not knowing what to expect, the second time was knowing what to expect and being given the obvious (to me it wasn't because I'm stupid) Hamlet parallels by Karen, and this third time will of course be read through the lens of the great big awful thing that would happen, and with whatever other bits and pieces I'm brining to the novel that I didn't have last time. I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to read it over again yet though, I still can't quite deal with the great big awful thing).Blah, sorry this wasn't much of a review. Should I review a bit? Ok, this is sort of turning the American expatriate novel on it's head. Instead of some artistic bohemians we get economic 'hitmen' sorts living in Greece and traveling through African and MIddle East countries in the late 1970's in the interest of banks, insurance and oil companies while violence and terrorism are on the rise. While Beirut and Tehran become hotspots with hostages and killing in the streets a mysterious cult is going about Greece, the Mideast and India killing ritualistically killing old men with hammers. Language, alphabets, corporate communications, ruins, a nine year old novelist and violence make up this novel, that (to me) is a great example of a novel where the parts are greater than the whole."], ["This man's got all sorts of work to celebrate.

More moving, though wildly different, is the phone conversation between the protagonist James, committed to Athens because of his cutting-edge work in \"corporate risk-assessment,\" & his former wife, the evening she commits to divorce & to taking their preteen son to live with her in Seattle.

It swims the Greek Aegean rather than the Neapolitan Tyrhennian, & more significantly, it never fails to suss out the close allegiances between affection & murder, love & madness, transcendence & depravity.

They talk about your country in a way that makes you uncomfortable with a perspective not really foreign or out of place but is that of a victim. You steer the conversation towards language and culture and let the woman's narration seem like a phantasmagoria. Death doesn't shake you but the context around it does. Her yell about context and words slam you in the worst way, making you stumble your words. The conversations are chunky and clunky, embarrassing and scaring you in a way you didn't think was possible. You take the next flight back to a country you've been trying call your home and strike up a conversation with a fellow frequent flyer. Death, like context, needs words.Words change with time. Words change with culture. Over the years, culture permeates the language and changes its flavor. Contexts add color. The names however kind of both mutate and manage to stay the same."]], "review_count": "189", "description": "Set against the backdrop of a lush and exotic Greece, <b>The Names</b> is considered the book which began to drive \"sharply upward the size of his readership\" (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>). Among the cast of DeLillo's bizarre yet fully realized characters in <b>The Names</b> are Kathryn, the narrator's estranged wife; their son, the six-year-old novelist; Owen, the scientist; and the neurotic narrator obsessed with his own neuroses. A thriller, a mystery, and still a moving examination of family, loss, and the amorphous and magical potential of language itself, <b>The Names</b> stands with any of DeLillo's more recent and highly acclaimed works. <br /><br />\"<b>The Names</b> not only accurately reflects a portion of our contemporary world but, more importantly, creates an original world of its own.\"--<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo sifts experience through simultaneous grids of science and poetry, analysis and clear sight, to make a high-wire prose that is voluptuously stark.\"--<i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i><br /><br />\"DeLillo verbally examines every state of consciousness from eroticism to tourism, from the idea of America as conceived by the rest of the world to the idea of the rest of the world as conceived by America, from mysticism to fanaticism.\"--<i>New York Times</i>", "author": "Don DeLillo"}, "My Inventions": {"average_rating": "4.02", "review": [["Great book about one of the greatest inventors of all time. Sadly this book is \"too\" small and he just gives us a very brief glimpse of his inventions and ideas. I did not know many things about him before reading this book like: Tesla was involved in wireless research, Marconi actually stole the Radio idea from Tesla. I always related Tesla with alternating current and did not know that he was into wireless as well.I also liked that his main intention for inventing something was not to get applause or make money. He did all the hard work only for the betterment of the society. I admire him for his ideas to unite the world using wireless, using aerial machines as he calls them that revolve around the Earth.\"Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races... There is in fact but one race, of many colors.\"He was way ahead of his time and people did not encourage many of his brilliant ideas, which is really sad. They thought his ideas were too unpractical(he even mentions that people laughed at his ideas). But we now see those ideas were realistic since many of them have been implemented in real life.Even though he was a scientist, he strongly believed in God!I watched a movie sometime back about Tesla - \"The Secret of Nikola Tesla(Tajna Nikole Tesla)\". This movie went into the details about his life. I did not know about his involvement with Niagara project until I watched this video. Edison thought he was the \"father of electricity\" and couldn't tolerate another man coming up with a better form of electricity (Alternating current by Tesla). He never cared for money and he gave all his money to Westinghouse without thinking twice.Do watch it if you are interested in learning more about this man's inventions.Check this link for more details about his work:  Oatmeal's article about Tesla"], ["What a bizarre little book. Tesla has always seemed to me someone who existed in a space between our world and another unfathomable place, brought here by a glitch in dimensions or something. This loose memoir confirms my suspicions :). And not only because of passages like this: \"I had a brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree; one of those rare phenomena of mentality which biological investigation has failed to explain. His premature death left my earth parents disconsolate.\" No, it's also how differently he thought about inventing and engineering than everyone else. It's not particularly well-written in the standard sense (and my copy, at least, was ATROCIOUSLY edited). But that's not really what it's about anyway. It's about getting the chance to spend time with a quirky genius."], ["\"Dana\u0161nji znanstvenici misle duboko, a ne jasno.

He first caught my attention (of course as an engineer I had studied about the IS unit of the strength of a magnetic field named after him) in Nolan\u2019s movie \u201cthe prestige\u201d in which he was pictured as a kind of magician who could easily duplicate a cat or magically light wireless lamps. I wanted to know more about him and now reading his autobiography I find him as a naturally talented genius with a bit of vanity but otherwise brilliant.In the book, he mostly talked about himself, his family and friends and generally more human topics than scientific ones. He manifested his early sparkles of innovation and described his incentives and aims. He also told us about some of his magnificent inventions in details. He had ideas about future, as well and predicted a good deal of occurrences meticulously.He predicted a great scientific advance in which some of his inventions will be the basis: The Tesla Transformer, The Magnifying Transmitter, The Tesla Wireless System, The Terrestrial Stationary Waves which will result in many things he predicted amongst which are internet, wireless phones, GPS and many other phenomena so usual for us. He described his works too far ahead of time and thought that the world wasn\u2019t ready for them.He is the most important and effective inventor of the 20th century. He was also new-fashioned in many ways as he was anti-racist, vegetarian and \u2026\u201cPeace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization, because few indeed, will admit the reality that God made man in His image in which case all earth men are alike.

Christ is but one person, yet he is of all people, so why do some people think themselves better than some other people?\u201d"], ["Tesla'n\u0131n kendi dilinden epey teknik de olsa icatlar\u0131n\u0131 dinlemek g\u00fczel.

Tesla was famous for inventing alternating current (AC), which is used in every house and electric motor today. He was a famous scientist of his time, and supposedly there was some rift with him and Edison. It appears actually that Tesla sold his patents and the company that bought them sued everyone else, causing his name to be associated with the suits, even though he wasn't really involved. Tesla is also known for being a little too eccentric later in his career, trying to invent things that were impossible like wireless power.I found this book a really good read, because Tesla is a character, and not a bad writer! He tells a lot of stories of his childhood, which were a very interesting glimpse into a great mind.One part I liked was when Tesla was expounding on his personal philosophy of health, or 'focusing on himself'. He was frequently ill and overworked, and had to spend a lot of time working on his health. At one point he says of coffee and tea \"These delicious beverages superexcite and gradually exhaust the fine fibers of the brain. They also interfere seriously with arterial circulation and should be enjoyed all the more sparingly as their deleterious effects are slow and imperceptible.\" He then goes on to say \"The truth about this is that we need stimulants to do our best work under present living conditions, and that we must exercise moderation and control our appetites and inclinations in every direction.\" I think this is my new philosophy.Tesla was also a believer that he who works harder will be successful. As someone who is starting a company (Goodreads), I'm starting to have a big appreciation for those who can believe in an idea against all odds, when everyone else believes it can't be done. It takes a special kind of person - one driven by passion in their ideas. Tesla's work schedule from college is also inspiring - he would work in the lab from 10am until 5am the next day. I've often heard lots of genius's haven't needed much sleep - I wish I could do that!"], ["This has been very, very interesting. A book written by an undisputed genius in his very own words.I must say this book was a surprise. I was expecting lots of technical detail, but instead the book was filled with lots of interesting stories and insightful social comment. Some of the stories were even hilarious, causing me to laugh out loud a number of times.The book also gives some insight into what it's like to be a genius, and some of the abilities such a person possesses. For instance, drawing on a blackboard bored Nikola because he could draw things in his mind that were as real to him as if they were written down in the physical world. Indeed, later in life he used this ability to design a number of his inventions, and once constructed in the real world they worked the very first time since he had already tested them out - in his mind!Tesla also suffered from frail health most of his life, having several near death experiences. After one of these, he chronologically recalled in full detail his entire life from the time he was a baby in his mother's arms up to his present over a period of years - as if he was reliving everything.There are a number of social observations towards the end of the book that are still relevant to our time. Written during the Prohibition (1920-1933), Tesla foresaw a time when entire cities would be destroyed in an instant, and our only hope for peace was a global communication and transport system.My only disappointment in the man is that he was quite a determinist, to such an extent that he would have made B.F. Skinner proud. Still, for someone who single-handed invented our entire AC power grid and succeeded in promoting it over the objections of Edison, he was a genius of the sort that the world seldom sees."],

Like anyone else who knows a thing or two about political participation and social capital, this book rings hollow and insincere at certain points.Briefly, Putnam rests far too much of his argument on the decline of traditional, conventional \"community organizations\" of a previous era (like The Lion's Club, the Elks or the Masons). He pays scant attention to how divisive, racist, sexist, and homophobic many of these organizations were and how they all demanded a degree of conformity. Furthermore, he manages to write off the importance of both social movements and support-based groups in a single, short chapter without acknowledging the way that social movements allow new flexible forms of participation or how support-based groups may allow a greater degree of \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" social capital. If you take an AA meeting or a meeting for single parents, of course the people in these groups have a single thing in common but they are just as likely to have many things not in common, such as the neighbourhood they live in, the type of job they have, and racial background.Further to this, his means of measurement are simply not adequate. Using the GSS to track club involvement is disingenuous, for example, because they ask \"Were you a member of this type of club?\" The answer is yes or no, and does not allow individuals to count the multiple kinds of clubs they belong to of a single kind (such as belonging to two environmental clubs).There is certainly something going in American - CONVENTIONAL forms of political participation and civic participation are declining, but there are many emerging forms of participation which Putnam writes off or ignores altogether. He acknowledges that we need to find new ways to participate that that fit our current era as the old kinds of community organization may not work, but at the same time he ignores, writes off, or undervalues the ways in which people are already participating in new and innovative ways - such as support groups, continuing social movements, community festivals, pick-up sports leagues, short-lived issue based groups, more flexible forms of political participation, and the multiple kinds of participation that are made possible by the internet and related forms of technology.Still, there is a great deal of valuable information in this book and a number of keen insights but Putnam's needs to open his mind up to new, innovative, and unconventional forms of participation and networks in order to make a more convincing argument."], ["God this book is painstaking. (Read: painful.) It's good, it's thorough, and I read all five hundred pages or whatever. But the writing style induces anguish. It's so full of qualifications like: \"But this correlation doesn't imply causality\" or \"Even when we hold race, class, gender, education, and imcome constant...\"I'll save you hours of your life and give you the summary: Throughout the twentieth century, more and more Americans were participating in clubs, having dinner parties, going to church, volunteering, working on political campaigns--until the 1970s. Then, this steady increase in partipation became a sharp drop, and civic life continues to decline. Various things could have caused the decline: women entering the work force, racial integration, the internet, longer commutes, busier work schedules. Really, though, the evidence points to two main things that caused this decline: television and generational differences (the baby boomers were less likely to volunteer, Gen X even moreso, and so on). This is a shame, because people who are involved in civic life (even something as small as playing cards or hosting dinner parties) are more likely to vote, to volunteer, to have friends, to create safe neighborhoods, to make more money, etc, etc. This book might just finally get my ass in gear to do the volunteering I've been talking about."], ["Robert Putnam's books was several books in one. The first section (about the first 4 chapters) drew me in with a synopsis of the decline of community in America. The second section, through chapter 15, nearly put me to sleep. :) Thankfully, however, I kept reading because from chapter 16 until the end of the book was so good, that I give it 5 stars despite the slogging in the middle. Putnam's five keys for social capital was worth the entire book. Here is my takeaways:Putnam list five specific areas where the trust and understanding inured by social capital helps translate aspirations into realities:1. Social capital allows citizens to resolve collective problems more easily through improved teamwork.2. Social capital greases the wheels that allow communities to advance smoothly through improved trust.3. Social capital helps widen the awareness of fellow citizens that their fates are intertwined through improved understanding.4. Social capital serves as conduits for the flow of helpful information and resources to accomplish community and individual goals.5. Social capital improves individual lives through psychological and biological processes. In fact, numerous studies suggest lives that are rich in social capital cope with trauma and illnesses significantly more effectively.Despite social capital\u2019s overwhelming advantages, Putnam acknowledges its decline, writing, \u201cAmericans have had a growing sense at some visceral level of disintegrating social bonds.\u201d Furthermore, he writes, \u201cMore than 80% of Americans said there should be more emphasis on community, even if it puts more demands on individuals.\u201d In sum, social capital isn\u2019t just the fuel for Social Power \u2013 a necessary check on State Power \u2013 but it also enhances individual lives through the sense of belonging engendered within communities. Strikingly, then, the decline of social capital, not only attacks society\u2019s freedoms, but also attacks an individual\u2019s well-being. Simply put, America cannot remain free without a revival of Social Power through building social capital in voluntary communities. With so much at stake, why aren\u2019t more people focused on restoring voluntary communities throughout America and the West?"], ["The classic that triggered the movement to study and document the collapse of \"social capital\" - obligatory and reciprocal social relationships that build through more regular human interaction with neighbors as well as in groups like bowling leagues (hence the metaphor in the title) and civic groups. By the end of the last decade, arguments for strategies and interventions that would augment \"social capital\" in both individual and communities were vogue in grant applications, showing how quickly Putnam's ideas became institutionalized.I've used an excerpt of this in my Intro. SOC class for a decade now and it's helpful for students to understand the context for the increasing alienation and dysfunction they feel in their own lives, especially when supplemented with the data that over a quarter of U.S. adults can name not a single friend and social isolation is a huge problem (and increasingly pointed to as a cause, not a consequence, of substance abuse and mental health problems.) There is also data from \"gated communities\", the phenomena separating the \"haves\" from the \"have nots\" around the world, that while residents naturally list security as a top attraction, \"knowing your neighbors\" was another top-listed reason, then many apparently drew a blank when later in the survey were asked to list neighbors they knew by first name. Only a small number listed even one. (This was a sociology study of gated community residents in Houston, TX, that was one of the original cities that started gated/locked communities. Of course, those Houstonites knew that their neighbors weren't brown or black skin, generally, so we know what is important about our neighbors in gated communities - they are wealthy and white!)Putnam is a good Liberal and no radical, but I can't help think that he didn't simply document what Marx predicted long ago, that capitalism would lead to alienation of self from others as well as from ourselves."], ["I'm not sure I could give full justice to this book in a hastily written review, so I'm not going to try. Robert Putnam's seminal treatise on social capital is jam-packed with statistics and information to back up his claims that social capital has been on a serious decline since the 1960s, much to the detriment of American society. He delineates a difference between two types of social capital--bonding (strong ties to a small inner circle of people, like family) and bridging (weak ties to a diverse and sprawling array of people)--and the struggle to balance between the two, even while both are declining. He explains the history of social capital and the decline, the possible reasons contributing to the decline, reasons why the decline of social capital is bad for society and suggestions for things that can be done to slow the decline. Everything he says is extensively researched and cited. Every time I thought I had come up with a counterargument or a detail he had missed, he addressed it a few pages or chapters later. The only problem with the book is that it was written in 2000. A surprising number of things have changed in the last eight years, including but not limited to: 9/11, Katrina, George Bush, Facebook/Myspace, broader expansion of use of the internet, 2008 Democratic Primaries, Iraq War, rise of the \"green\" movement, cheaper air travel, etc. In the last section of the book, he challenges society to make a series of changes by 2010, changes that sound somewhat impossible to achieve in so short a time. But, after just these eight years, it seems that much of what he prescribed is on its way to coming true, and I am very curious as to what he would have to say about it. Unfortunately, I think his research has moved on to other topics (diversity...). In any case, this is a very important book about the way members of our society interact (or don't interact) with each other and what that means."], ["Social capital is the grease that keeps society moving, but over the past 30 years it has decreased. Bowling Alone is the influential book that gathered the data behind this trend and put social capital on the radar of the nation.Social networks give rise to generalized reciprocity and trust. This is social capital. Reciprocity and trust are most useful when applied generally and not just those who have helped you in the past. Social capital allows society operate smoothly. People rely on social connections for friendships, romantic relationships, job referrals, and community and political organization. Social capital is correlated with individual happiness and with community goods such as lower crime rates.For all the good that it causes, social capital is, like most tools, not unambiguously good. Gangs and the KKK are held together by social capital just as the PTA and Habitat volunteers are. Being gay in a close knit conservative Christian community can ruin lives. The rarely realized ideal is a society with large amounts of social capital and a large tolerance for difference, but the tensions between these tendencies are hard to reconcile.Bowling Alone analyzes empirical data to show that social capital had been declining for 30 years (the book is copyright 2000, data from earlier). Putnam considers political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace connections, altruism, volunteering, and philanthropy, and perceptions of reciprocity, honesty, and trust. All measures have shown declines, from mild to dramatic. Some new trends seem to defy the decline (e.g., internet communities), but Putnam makes a compelling case that social capital is generally declining.Consider volunteering as an example. In the US, we volunteer about twice as much as in other developed nations. Volunteering may be formal (through an organization such as United Way) or informal (house sitting for a neighbor). Over half of Americans volunteer when informal volunteering is counted. Volunteering is correlated with higher levels of philanthropic giving.Education predicts volunteer activity; college graduates are twice as likely to volunteer. Parents volunteer the most because of their involvement with activities related to their children (e.g., school, sports teams). Community size, wealth, and family status are other predictors of volunteer activity. Americans who entertain at home are also more likely to volunteer than those who do not.Community involvement is the most important predictor of volunteer activity. Data from 1996 shows that 73% of members of secular organizations and 55% of members of religious organizations volunteer. Only 19% of individuals not involved in organizations volunteer. Members of religious organizations tend to volunteer mostly for their church. Organizations provide volunteer opportunities for their members and act as recruitment pools.Over the past 30 years, volunteer activity has not dropped across the board. Formal volunteering has decreased, but informal volunteering is more common. More people outside of organizations are volunteering, but they do not form long term relationships. There is a troubling generational decline with respect to volunteer activity. The \"long civic generation\", the generation before the Boomers, has volunteered more at every stage of life than the Boomers and Generation X is worse (although there have been indications that the Millenials may be reversing this slightly).What is behind the declines in volunteering and other types of participation? Given the difficulty of analyzing social trends, Putnam's explanations are guesses. Up to 10% of the decline in these measures can be attributed to time and money pressures on families, up to another 10% can be explained by suburban sprawl and long commutes, and another 25% can be explained by electronic media, especially television. By far, the largest contributor generational succession. The Boomers and Generation X replace the long civic generation in numbers, but their percentage participation is comparatively abysmal. This may explain up to half of the decline in participation. Why this is occurring is an open question.Overall, Bowling Alone was a fascinating and informative book. The quantitative information makes it a valid and credible resource. The publication of Bowling Alone prompted debate over the conclusions Putnam drew, but makes it clear that there are trends to consider, and whether they are considered good, bad, or neutral, they are worth examining."], ["read for my social democracy seminar. it seems really logical now, but when the book was written in 1995, and it was really, really revolutionary. his main thesis is that americans are not volunteering in the same ways in before - we are not joining community organizations anymore. young people are still volunteering, but mostly individually. (his title comes from the fact that people don't join bowling leagues anymore.) i would recommend reading the first half, skimming the statistics, and reading the conclusion. it's genius for what it is, and i wish more people would read it. it was so ground-breaking."], ["This is one of those books that I suspect of being cited (and argued against) far more often than it's read. In my head, I had it classed vaguely as pop social science. Turns out, I was very wrong. Bowling Alone may be the most academic book I've read since leaving college, and at times I felt like I was being beaten to the ground by statistical clubs coming at me from every direction. But despite the leaden density and occasional painful-in-retrospect predictions about our technological future, this is an important book, one that's challenged many of my assumptions and given me a new framework in which to consider everyday events.And no, I don't just like it because it, like me, is critical of cars, critical of televisions, and willing to blame the Baby Boomers for planting the seeds of so many of our current social ills. But I admit those things don't hurt."], ["Putnam's research on this phenomenon is valuable, but because of his egalitarian convictions he obscures a core cause of it (multiculturalism and non-White immigration) and refuses to draw the obvious conclusion or make the necessary policy recommendations."], ["I found this book fascinating, and couldn't stop talking about it while I was reading it and for several months afterward. While I found the approach to \"social capital\" somewhat akin to commoditizing friendships and civic interaction, I found so much richness in Putnam's thoughtful analysis of multiple diverse data sources, with plenty of charts and graphs to enjoy!Putnam's premise is that our stores of social capital in the U.S. have been making a drastic plummeting curve (in visual terms) since the 60s. As I understand it, by social capital he is referring to the social connections that make a cohesive community, or on a larger scale, a nation. These can include informal measures such as playing cards, bowling leagues or having friends over for dinner, or formal measures such as PTA enrollment, church attendance, and voting. He presents chapters and chapters of evidence to support his observation, and attempts to explore a few possible explanations for this phenomenon. I appreciate that he doesn't pretend to have the answer, and doesn't present one possibility as the culprit. I also appreciate that he takes a look at the \"dark side\" of social capital--homogeneity and exclusivity. This book was published in 200, so I would love to read an updated look at this topic.Here are a few examples from the book:\"During the fist two-thirds of the century Americans took a more and more active role in the social and political life of their communities--in churches and union halls, in bowling alleys and clubrooms, around committee tables and card tables and dinner tables. Year by year we gave more generously to charity, we pitched in more often on community projects, and (insofar as we can still find reliable evidence) we behaved in an increasingly trustworthy way toward one another. Then, mysteriously and more or less simultaneously, we began to do all those things less often.We are still more civically engaged than citizens in many other countries, but compared with our own recent past, we are less connected. We remain interested and critical spectators of the public scene. We kibitz, but we don't play, We maintain a facade of formal affiliation, but we rarely show up. We have invented new ways of expressing our demands that demand less of us. We are less likely to turn out for collective deliberation--whether in the voting booth or the meeting hall--and when we do, we find that discouragingly few of our friends and neighbors have shown up. We are less generous with our money and (with the important exception of senior citizens) with our time, and we are less likely to give strangers the benefit of the doubt. They, of course, return the favor.\"(183)\"Compared with the citizens of most other countries, Americans have always lived a nomadic existence. Nearly one in five of us move each year and, having done so, are likely to pick up and move again. More than two in five of us expect to move in the next five years. As a result, compared with other peoples, Americans have become accustomed to pitching camp quickly and making friends easily. From our frontier and immigrant past we have learned to plunge into new community institutions when we move.Nevertheless, for people as for plants, frequent repotting disrupts root systems.\"(204)\"The car and the commute...are demonstrably bad for community life. In round numbers the evidence suggests that each additional ten minutes in daily commuting time cuts involvement in community affairs by 10 percent...Strikingly, increased commuting time among the residents of a community lowers average levels of civic involvement even among noncommuters...In other words, this appears to be a classic \"synergistic effect,\" in which the consequences of individual actions spill beyond the individuals in question. In the language of economists, commuting has negative externalities.\"(213)\"Electronic technology allows us to consume this hand-tailored entertainment in private, even utterly alone...As the poet T.S. Eliot observed early in the television age, \"It is a medium of entertainment which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, and yet remain lonesome.\" The artifice of canned laughter reflected both the enduring fact that mirth is enhanced by companionship and the novel fact that companionship could now be simulated electronically.\"(217)\"Child psychologists speak of a fairly primitive stage of social development called \"parallel play\"--two kids in a sandbox, each playing with a toy but not really interacting with each other. In healthy development children outgrow parallel play. But the public spectacles of television leave us at that arrested stage of development, rarely moving beyond parallel attentiveness to the same external stimulus.\"(244)\"With evidence from a single point in time, we cannot distinguish between life cycle and generational effects, but if we follow a given cohort over the years, we can more readily distinguish the two. And the two effects have dramatically different social consequences. Life cycle effects mean that individuals change, but society as a whole does not. Generational effects mean that society changes, even though individuals do not.So before we can tell whether the ubiquitous age-related differences in civic engagement are truly generational, and thus producing social change, we need to determine whether these differences are attributable to the normal life cycle. With comparable evidence across several decades, we can follow each cohort as its members move through various stages of life. If successive cohorts generally retrace the same ups and downs as they age, we can be reasonably sure that we are observing a life cycle pattern. If not, it is more likely that age-related differences are generational in origin.\"(248)\"Social scientists have long been concerned about \"dilemmas\" of collective action. Such dilemmas are ubiquitous, and their dynamics are straightforward. People often might all be better off if they cooperate, with each doing her share. But each individual benefits more by shirking her responsibility, hoping that others will do the work for her. Moreover, even if she is wrong and the others shirk, too, she is still better off than if she had been the only sucker. Obviously if every individual thinks that the others will do the work, nobody will end up taking part, and all will be left worse off than if all had contributed.\"(288)\"It turns out that in states where citizens view other people as basically honest, tax compliance is higher than in low-social-capital states...Similarly, surveys have found that individual taxpayers who believe that others are dishonest or are distrustful of government are more likely themselves to cheat. My willingness to pay my share depends crucially on my perception that others are doing the same.

I began in summer 2016 but couldn\u2019t get into it. Picked it back up at the start of my fall semester this year but couldn\u2019t get into it. Picked it up again at the end of the semester and forced myself to through.All in all his was a fascinating book that did an incredible job capturing the complicated life of an American Immigrant icon. While I was reading the book I struggled with how in depth and technical it got with his patents and his competitor\u2019s patents at times but once I decided \u201cit\u2019s okay not to retain every word\u201d and just kept reading, these tid-bits of information no longer slowed me down and by the end of the book I was excited to learn more. It almost read like it was letting you in on a secret, at times differentiating what the world saw at a given time and what actually happened (like with all of his feuds and how for decades those who pirated his work were rewarded).What I enjoyed most about this tale was seeing how intertwined he was with the most powerful American families of all time. This was a man who worked with both JP Morgan and Jr. He was a direct rival of Edison and a pen pal of Elenor Roosevelt.I am incredibly happy to have finally finished this book."], ["Nikola Tesla was an amazing genius. He came very close to winning a Nobel Prize, jointly with Edison. Tesla was an brilliant, arrogant, eccentric character, full of energy. He made numerous fundamental scientific discoveries, and tried, to some extent, to capitalize on his discoveries through a whole host of inventions. He obtained many diverse patents, but he had little business sense, and this was exacerbated by corporations that often infringed on his patents without offering compensation. Corporations (Westinghouse, RCA, AT&T, American Marconi) around the turn of the century had only profit as their motive, and honor and honesty was not given even a wink. He was more responsible for wireless communication than Marconi, but to this day people credit Marconi with the invention.On the other hand, Tesla was the quintessential \"mad scientist\". He was often far ahead of his time, and people did not believe his grandiose ideas and grandiose claims. The thing is, he often came through on his grandiose claims. Before issuing a patent for \"teleautomation\", the chief patent examiner insisted on coming to witness Tesla's invention, and saw for himself that it did work. J.P. Morgan initially invested in Tesla's \"wireless\" system so that ships and racing boats could be tracked while at sea. However, Tesla took the investment and proceeded to develop ever-more grand systems to transmit radio waves across the oceans, even around the world. Then, when Tesla started to claim that he was working on wireless transmission of power, Morgan actively discouraged investors. Not because Morgan doubted that Tesla would be successful--on the contrary--he knew that the \"wizard\" would come through on his fantastic claims. Morgan did not believe in distribution of power \"for free.\"Toward the end of his life, Tesla made claims that he had invented a particle-beam death ray. We don't know if it was true--but it did get some attention from the FBI and other government agencies--after he died! And his eccentricity seems to be boundless--he hired people to feed pigeons in public places around New York City.My favorite story is about how, in the very earliest days of his wireless experiments in Colorado Springs, he heard three distinct \"taps\". Tesla attributed the taps to communications from Martians. Later he was told that Marconi had been simultaneously demonstrating to the British Navy a long-range radio transmission. Tesla, though, still held onto his claim that he was receiving messages from Mars!This book contains a wealth of detail about Tesla's life. It quotes many letters and documents written by Tesla, or to Tesla, or about him. Sometimes I felt that the book went into too much detail--it could have been considerably shorter without lessening its impact. The book contains some interesting analyses of Tesla's life, and some speculations as to why Tesla behaved as he did. The book goes into psychoanalytic speculation about reasons why Tesla became so eccentric--reasons having to do with early events in his life, when he grew up in Serbia. Tesla was the uncle of the author's father. Nevertheless, this family relationship does not seem to cloud or bias this biography. Both the good and the less-good points of Tesla's life story are included."], ["This book is actually the reason I can't check out anything at the SF Public Library anymore. I took it out years ago, and by the time I started it, it was due back again. But being the lazy bastard I am, I just kept reading it because it was so engrossing, and never renewed it. Tesla was, next to Da Vinci, probably the purest and most intuitive scientific genius ever to have lived. He was also one of the most paranoid and eccentric, but really everyone knows that is a prerequisite for genius. Seeing how badly Edison screwed him over, and the personal hatred Edison had for him, was shocking, not to mention the experiments Tesla did in Colorado with 'free energy', make it worthwhile. Oh, and he designed and tested all his machines in his head, so they worked perfectly the first time he built them almost always."], ["This was not an easy listen. Over 22 hours dense with information, including technical descriptions of Nikola Tesla's inventions!This being said, I am glad I bought this audiobook. It covers not only Tesla's inventions and ideas but also his cultural background, his relationships with quite a number of the luminaries of the times, as well as his physical and mental health. For this reader/listener with no electrical engineering background, the descriptions of Tesla's inventions and postulated theories, most of which in his own words, were a little hard to understand, let alone evaluate. However, bearing in mind that this is not a scientific appreciation of Tesla's work but his biography, the book fulfilled my desire to know more about Tesla's achievements and why he was transformed into a mythical figure. The technical descriptions were informative enough to give the general reader/listener a fairly good insight into an array of Tesla's inventions, including both the proved and the postulated ones.Therefore, I appreciate Mr. Seifer's efforts to do Nikola Tesla justice, separating the myth built around him from historic facts, fairly pointing out where Tesla was wrong, and thus bringing Tesla's fascinating accomplishments and ideas/postulated theories into proper perspective.I liked how the book was organized. It was set chronologically, yet centered on Tesla's world wireless communication system (Wardenclyffe), involving Tesla's desire and efforts to make wireless transmission of power possible (which seems to have stuck in the throat of the electrical engineering companies battling for their share in the market). What I found both interesting and saddening were the descriptions of the competition between inventors, disputes about who was 'the first' and Tesla's struggles against patent infringements. The book renders both Tesla's virtues and his weaknesses, and I must admit that some of Tesla's quirks made me dislike him at times. In spite of it, I found the events leading to the development of radio (the Wireless) most saddening. Tesla aimed valiantly high (ahead of this time), which unfortunately led him to a blind alley and lose the battle with Marconi (though he was able to recover some money in the Courts long after Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics).(view spoiler)[I digress a little, but I couldn't help but laugh at myself when I read Tesla's argument against Einstein's theory of relativity, claiming, \u201cI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. ... Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\u201cWell, as I myself was inclined to refuse to subscribe to such a view, I would recommend Tesla (if he were alive) to read Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore in order to learn how to understand/interpret Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the concept of 'curved space' properly. (hide spoiler)]All in all, I congratulate Mr. Seifer on well researched and fairly even-handed biography of Nikola Tesla. While some of Tesla's postulated inventions, as described, left me wondering whether they were only the product of a brilliant dreamer (in this context, be prepared for a bit of conspiracy theories at the end of the book, regarding Tesla's 'death beam weapon'), the book as a whole succeeded to convince me that this genius deserves better recognition.As my review refers to the audio version of Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius, let me say a word or two about the narration. Simon Prebble's performance is excellent indeed. It suits the times in which Tesla lived, as well as the general mood of the book. I particularly enjoyed how Mr. Prebble voiced Tesla's personal correspondence with J.P. Morgan and others, bringing life and personality to the characters in the book."], ["This book was long. I had my doubts about finishing this one in a month but I ended up wrapping it up in just over a week. Although, that has more to do with Tesla's character and his inventions rather than Author's writing style. Though, to be fair to the Author, he has done a decent job of making the book dramatic enough especially considering it is actually a Biography.It is clear from the book that Tesla was a Brilliant man whose ideas were well ahead of his time. At the same time, book has enough evidence and stories from his life to prove that many of those ideas were not executed to completion by Tesla. It is also clear that Tesla was no genius when it came to his social skills and financial management. This book makes you wonder what more greater inventions this great (sometimes also called mad) scientist could've done for man kind, if he had at least one of those two skills. Personally for me, the best (and partly sad) part of the book were Tesla's and J.P Morgan's exchanges. Frankly, I really do not think either J.P or Tesla were wrong in what they did. Tesla had really a lot to prove since he had no practical application of most of the claims he was making and Morgan was trying to be what he is, a Businessman. The desperation in Tesla's tone in those letters to J.P Morgan clearly presents the state of his mind in those days. In spite of that, it is commendable that Tesla's objective was more or less to bring about a Revolution in the Wireless Systems. It is even more admiring because of the fact that most of his contemporaries especially Edison, Marconi etc were bad mouthing Tesla in the scientific community and were always on the look out for ways to bring him down.Other than this, the other interesting parts were stories about Westinghouse and RCA's formation, Tesla's rivalry with Edison and Marconi, Tesla's views on Einstein's theory of relativity, World war and its impacts on US policies on Patent Infringement and many more. It is a shame that Tesla (and Edison) never won a Nobel Prize especially considering that other people who actually build their inventions using his ideas went on to get a Nobel Prize and also lived a much more financially stable life than him.Overall, I would say the book is good. Just keep in mind the fact that it is a Biography and that the Author might not be highly qualified to give you all the technical details about Tesla's inventions."], ["This was a good but difficult book. The author is intent on putting down in meticulous detail the life of this amazing character and in doing so skips around with chaotic effect. Tesla knew and interacted with many famous people of his time and it was hard keeping track of his interactions with them as the author related stories and jumped from one character to another.The author relates in detail the many inventions and ideas that Nikola Tesla advanced that were subsequently used by other inventors who gave no credit to Tesla and in fact stole his ideas. There are many instances depicted where Tesla is depicted as constantly fighting to convince the world that his ideas were stolen by other famous inventors. There are chapters which begin with one topic and then switch for no particular reason to another seemingly unrelated topic.There are things I liked about the book. I liked reading about Teslas conviction that he could communicate with Mars and how he had a vision of the world wide web and cellular communication. I was fascinated with the struggles Tesla had in the Wardenclyffe project.I liked the depiction of Teslas relationship to Katherine Underwood Johnson and would have liked a more satisfying telling of that relationship. The author simply announces at one point a list of people who died and Katherine is among this list. This is the main problem I had with this book. The organization requires better editing.Another aspect of the book that turned me off was the constant detail concerning monetary and financial problems. It seems like Tesla was constantly concerned with obtaining funding for his many inventions. I suppose this is the plight of many an inventor but I would have preferred less detailing of this (to me) boring topic.Although I struggled with this book, I did enjoy reading about this great man's life and work and would recommend this book for anyone interested in Nikola Tesla."], ["Tesla is one of the most awesomest coolio scientists evah. Totally. Check out what The Oatmeal has to say: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla.And if you're writing your dissertation on Tesla and need to know whether he was in New Jersey or New York on April 19th so that you can confirm that a conversation really took place, this is the book for you. It's great at that level of documentation. On the other hand, if you want to read about how awesomely coolio Tesla was, this book may make you want to gouge your eyes out.I do not need to know which of his instructors at university was mustachioed and which had a full head of hair. Really, really do not. Do not care. Yet I really care about Tesla - I'd love to learn more about him. This book is not the means to that end for me. The minutia killed it for me.I'd give it three stars because it obviously gives historical information that people want, but I'm mad about the way it made me feel. Admittedly I'm not an engineer and don't know a whole lot about electricity. But I'm not stupid - I read a lot of books about various branches of science. But this book was so overwhelmingly tedious that it made me want to read a picture book about Tesla. Or a pop-up book! That would be fun! I just wanted to get to the good stuff, and I felt superficial in the face of this dense collection of minutia. The emphasis on tiny unimportant (to my mind) details lessened the impact of Tesla's discoveries and inventions. The elevation of the unimportant made the important seem flat. I wasn't able to maintain my attention, and also was wearied by the effort required to sift through to find the interesting stuff.So only two stars. Tesla, though: 17 stars."], ["When I review a biography, I usually start by saying \"look how awesome this guy is\" and then rambling about his appearance, his style, etc.Well, look how awesome this guy is. He's like a more dashing Marcel Proust. He's got a handsome but not showy mustachio. He's got that cool oiled hair thing going on.But Tesla's coolness is more about his showmanship. He took this terrifying, new thing called electricity, stuff that comes down from the sky and explodes trees and cows, and he just sits there reading a magazine while it rages around him. Or he'll walk out on a stage into the midst of bolts of electricity, walking through it like it's a waterfall instead of magical death light, protected only by the cork lining his shoes.And it's not just Tesla's wacky experiments that make him so compelling. It's his personality and his history of hardships. He's a tragic figure, the Melville of science, who ran into some fame and fortune, but was ultimately condemned to a life of struggle and a death alone in a hotel room.I won't force you to read this book. But you should at least read the Wikipedia article because this dude is really interesting."], ["I\u2019m still looking for the definitive biography on Nikola Tesla because rest assured this isn\u2019t it.The author throws non-essential information about like it was confetti. I knew from the first chapter when he starts with the history of Croatia that this would be a less than promising beginning. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t get any better. People keep cropping up who had very little contact with or influence on Tesla. Information on his discoveries are kept to a minimum while matters of who filed what patent and when go on ad nauseum. There\u2019s very little real science involved. It\u2019s amazing how many times the author strays off the subject to bring up a trivial piece of data I could\u2019ve lived the rest of my life without knowing. I\u2019m willing to bet that overall more of the text is not about Tesla. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a book about such a creative genius could be balled up to the point of practically making it unreadable. Cripes! Please, somebody write a really good biography of this man who deserves better than the treatment here."], ["I'm embarrassed to admit it, but before reading this book, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had pretty much bought into the new age mythology that Tesla was a mystic genius visionary who was the victim of Edison's jealous, evil industrialist thievery and sabotage. Now, after reading accounts of Tesla's embarrassing social, financial and professional missteps, his ridiculous pleading correspondences to J.P. Morgan (and other wealthy would-be benefactors), and less than half baked journal submissions (particularly the one that interpreted a three beat radio transmission as a communication from intelligent extra terrestrials), I'm seeing Tesla in a whole new light. Rather than a victim of conspiratorial thuggery, I now see Tesla as a victim of his own chronic douchiness.Tesla was clearly decades ahead of his peers. But being \"ahead of your time\", contrary to hipster dogma, is not necessarily a good thing. Tesla had amazing ideas. But good ideas without good execution are about useless, where as even mediocre ideas, well executed, can at least be useful to someone. Tesla was with out a doubt, an amazing inventor. But it's hard not to feel like he could have achieved so much more if he wasn't such a dysfunctional, self sabotaging, grandiose douche bag.This book is a well done (if a little long) biography of a fascinating (to say the least) character from a fascinating time. But the real value of the book is as a cautionary tale of how unchecked cognitive biases (see: confirmation bias) and magical thinking can be the undoing of even brilliant and talented people like Tesla. Be warned; if your model of reality becomes too divorced from actual reality, you may needlessly fritter away your hard work and talent on some really ridiculous shit. Read this book, particularly if you like biographies of scientists, but if you're one of those Tesla worshipers, be prepared to deify the guy a whole lot less upon completion. Ultimately, the book renders a portrait of Tesla that is humane and realistic. Uncovering Tesla's scammy shenanigans, unexamined self delusions and outrageous foibles, while concurrently celebrating his incredible creativity and authentic brilliance.BTW: a film is in production starring (self serious, tortured) Christian Bale as Tesla.

Like anyone else who knows a thing or two about political participation and social capital, this book rings hollow and insincere at certain points.Briefly, Putnam rests far too much of his argument on the decline of traditional, conventional \"community organizations\" of a previous era (like The Lion's Club, the Elks or the Masons). He pays scant attention to how divisive, racist, sexist, and homophobic many of these organizations were and how they all demanded a degree of conformity. Furthermore, he manages to write off the importance of both social movements and support-based groups in a single, short chapter without acknowledging the way that social movements allow new flexible forms of participation or how support-based groups may allow a greater degree of \"bonding\" and \"bridging\" social capital. If you take an AA meeting or a meeting for single parents, of course the people in these groups have a single thing in common but they are just as likely to have many things not in common, such as the neighbourhood they live in, the type of job they have, and racial background.Further to this, his means of measurement are simply not adequate. Using the GSS to track club involvement is disingenuous, for example, because they ask \"Were you a member of this type of club?\" The answer is yes or no, and does not allow individuals to count the multiple kinds of clubs they belong to of a single kind (such as belonging to two environmental clubs).There is certainly something going in American - CONVENTIONAL forms of political participation and civic participation are declining, but there are many emerging forms of participation which Putnam writes off or ignores altogether. He acknowledges that we need to find new ways to participate that that fit our current era as the old kinds of community organization may not work, but at the same time he ignores, writes off, or undervalues the ways in which people are already participating in new and innovative ways - such as support groups, continuing social movements, community festivals, pick-up sports leagues, short-lived issue based groups, more flexible forms of political participation, and the multiple kinds of participation that are made possible by the internet and related forms of technology.Still, there is a great deal of valuable information in this book and a number of keen insights but Putnam's needs to open his mind up to new, innovative, and unconventional forms of participation and networks in order to make a more convincing argument."], ["God this book is painstaking. (Read: painful.) It's good, it's thorough, and I read all five hundred pages or whatever. But the writing style induces anguish. It's so full of qualifications like: \"But this correlation doesn't imply causality\" or \"Even when we hold race, class, gender, education, and imcome constant...\"I'll save you hours of your life and give you the summary: Throughout the twentieth century, more and more Americans were participating in clubs, having dinner parties, going to church, volunteering, working on political campaigns--until the 1970s. Then, this steady increase in partipation became a sharp drop, and civic life continues to decline. Various things could have caused the decline: women entering the work force, racial integration, the internet, longer commutes, busier work schedules. Really, though, the evidence points to two main things that caused this decline: television and generational differences (the baby boomers were less likely to volunteer, Gen X even moreso, and so on). This is a shame, because people who are involved in civic life (even something as small as playing cards or hosting dinner parties) are more likely to vote, to volunteer, to have friends, to create safe neighborhoods, to make more money, etc, etc. This book might just finally get my ass in gear to do the volunteering I've been talking about."], ["Robert Putnam's books was several books in one. The first section (about the first 4 chapters) drew me in with a synopsis of the decline of community in America. The second section, through chapter 15, nearly put me to sleep. :) Thankfully, however, I kept reading because from chapter 16 until the end of the book was so good, that I give it 5 stars despite the slogging in the middle. Putnam's five keys for social capital was worth the entire book. Here is my takeaways:Putnam list five specific areas where the trust and understanding inured by social capital helps translate aspirations into realities:1. Social capital allows citizens to resolve collective problems more easily through improved teamwork.2. Social capital greases the wheels that allow communities to advance smoothly through improved trust.3. Social capital helps widen the awareness of fellow citizens that their fates are intertwined through improved understanding.4. Social capital serves as conduits for the flow of helpful information and resources to accomplish community and individual goals.5. Social capital improves individual lives through psychological and biological processes. In fact, numerous studies suggest lives that are rich in social capital cope with trauma and illnesses significantly more effectively.Despite social capital\u2019s overwhelming advantages, Putnam acknowledges its decline, writing, \u201cAmericans have had a growing sense at some visceral level of disintegrating social bonds.\u201d Furthermore, he writes, \u201cMore than 80% of Americans said there should be more emphasis on community, even if it puts more demands on individuals.\u201d In sum, social capital isn\u2019t just the fuel for Social Power \u2013 a necessary check on State Power \u2013 but it also enhances individual lives through the sense of belonging engendered within communities. Strikingly, then, the decline of social capital, not only attacks society\u2019s freedoms, but also attacks an individual\u2019s well-being. Simply put, America cannot remain free without a revival of Social Power through building social capital in voluntary communities. With so much at stake, why aren\u2019t more people focused on restoring voluntary communities throughout America and the West?"], ["The classic that triggered the movement to study and document the collapse of \"social capital\" - obligatory and reciprocal social relationships that build through more regular human interaction with neighbors as well as in groups like bowling leagues (hence the metaphor in the title) and civic groups. By the end of the last decade, arguments for strategies and interventions that would augment \"social capital\" in both individual and communities were vogue in grant applications, showing how quickly Putnam's ideas became institutionalized.I've used an excerpt of this in my Intro. SOC class for a decade now and it's helpful for students to understand the context for the increasing alienation and dysfunction they feel in their own lives, especially when supplemented with the data that over a quarter of U.S. adults can name not a single friend and social isolation is a huge problem (and increasingly pointed to as a cause, not a consequence, of substance abuse and mental health problems.) There is also data from \"gated communities\", the phenomena separating the \"haves\" from the \"have nots\" around the world, that while residents naturally list security as a top attraction, \"knowing your neighbors\" was another top-listed reason, then many apparently drew a blank when later in the survey were asked to list neighbors they knew by first name. Only a small number listed even one. (This was a sociology study of gated community residents in Houston, TX, that was one of the original cities that started gated/locked communities. Of course, those Houstonites knew that their neighbors weren't brown or black skin, generally, so we know what is important about our neighbors in gated communities - they are wealthy and white!)Putnam is a good Liberal and no radical, but I can't help think that he didn't simply document what Marx predicted long ago, that capitalism would lead to alienation of self from others as well as from ourselves."], ["I'm not sure I could give full justice to this book in a hastily written review, so I'm not going to try. Robert Putnam's seminal treatise on social capital is jam-packed with statistics and information to back up his claims that social capital has been on a serious decline since the 1960s, much to the detriment of American society. He delineates a difference between two types of social capital--bonding (strong ties to a small inner circle of people, like family) and bridging (weak ties to a diverse and sprawling array of people)--and the struggle to balance between the two, even while both are declining. He explains the history of social capital and the decline, the possible reasons contributing to the decline, reasons why the decline of social capital is bad for society and suggestions for things that can be done to slow the decline. Everything he says is extensively researched and cited. Every time I thought I had come up with a counterargument or a detail he had missed, he addressed it a few pages or chapters later. The only problem with the book is that it was written in 2000. A surprising number of things have changed in the last eight years, including but not limited to: 9/11, Katrina, George Bush, Facebook/Myspace, broader expansion of use of the internet, 2008 Democratic Primaries, Iraq War, rise of the \"green\" movement, cheaper air travel, etc. In the last section of the book, he challenges society to make a series of changes by 2010, changes that sound somewhat impossible to achieve in so short a time. But, after just these eight years, it seems that much of what he prescribed is on its way to coming true, and I am very curious as to what he would have to say about it. Unfortunately, I think his research has moved on to other topics (diversity...). In any case, this is a very important book about the way members of our society interact (or don't interact) with each other and what that means."], ["Social capital is the grease that keeps society moving, but over the past 30 years it has decreased. Bowling Alone is the influential book that gathered the data behind this trend and put social capital on the radar of the nation.Social networks give rise to generalized reciprocity and trust. This is social capital. Reciprocity and trust are most useful when applied generally and not just those who have helped you in the past. Social capital allows society operate smoothly. People rely on social connections for friendships, romantic relationships, job referrals, and community and political organization. Social capital is correlated with individual happiness and with community goods such as lower crime rates.For all the good that it causes, social capital is, like most tools, not unambiguously good. Gangs and the KKK are held together by social capital just as the PTA and Habitat volunteers are. Being gay in a close knit conservative Christian community can ruin lives. The rarely realized ideal is a society with large amounts of social capital and a large tolerance for difference, but the tensions between these tendencies are hard to reconcile.Bowling Alone analyzes empirical data to show that social capital had been declining for 30 years (the book is copyright 2000, data from earlier). Putnam considers political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace connections, altruism, volunteering, and philanthropy, and perceptions of reciprocity, honesty, and trust. All measures have shown declines, from mild to dramatic. Some new trends seem to defy the decline (e.g., internet communities), but Putnam makes a compelling case that social capital is generally declining.Consider volunteering as an example. In the US, we volunteer about twice as much as in other developed nations. Volunteering may be formal (through an organization such as United Way) or informal (house sitting for a neighbor). Over half of Americans volunteer when informal volunteering is counted. Volunteering is correlated with higher levels of philanthropic giving.Education predicts volunteer activity; college graduates are twice as likely to volunteer. Parents volunteer the most because of their involvement with activities related to their children (e.g., school, sports teams). Community size, wealth, and family status are other predictors of volunteer activity. Americans who entertain at home are also more likely to volunteer than those who do not.Community involvement is the most important predictor of volunteer activity. Data from 1996 shows that 73% of members of secular organizations and 55% of members of religious organizations volunteer. Only 19% of individuals not involved in organizations volunteer. Members of religious organizations tend to volunteer mostly for their church. Organizations provide volunteer opportunities for their members and act as recruitment pools.Over the past 30 years, volunteer activity has not dropped across the board. Formal volunteering has decreased, but informal volunteering is more common. More people outside of organizations are volunteering, but they do not form long term relationships. There is a troubling generational decline with respect to volunteer activity. The \"long civic generation\", the generation before the Boomers, has volunteered more at every stage of life than the Boomers and Generation X is worse (although there have been indications that the Millenials may be reversing this slightly).What is behind the declines in volunteering and other types of participation? Given the difficulty of analyzing social trends, Putnam's explanations are guesses. Up to 10% of the decline in these measures can be attributed to time and money pressures on families, up to another 10% can be explained by suburban sprawl and long commutes, and another 25% can be explained by electronic media, especially television. By far, the largest contributor generational succession. The Boomers and Generation X replace the long civic generation in numbers, but their percentage participation is comparatively abysmal. This may explain up to half of the decline in participation. Why this is occurring is an open question.Overall, Bowling Alone was a fascinating and informative book.

In my head, I had it classed vaguely as pop social science. Turns out, I was very wrong. Bowling Alone may be the most academic book I've read since leaving college, and at times I felt like I was being beaten to the ground by statistical clubs coming at me from every direction. But despite the leaden density and occasional painful-in-retrospect predictions about our technological future, this is an important book, one that's challenged many of my assumptions and given me a new framework in which to consider everyday events.And no, I don't just like it because it, like me, is critical of cars, critical of televisions, and willing to blame the Baby Boomers for planting the seeds of so many of our current social ills. But I admit those things don't hurt."], ["Putnam's research on this phenomenon is valuable, but because of his egalitarian convictions he obscures a core cause of it (multiculturalism and non-White immigration) and refuses to draw the obvious conclusion or make the necessary policy recommendations."], ["I found this book fascinating, and couldn't stop talking about it while I was reading it and for several months afterward. While I found the approach to \"social capital\" somewhat akin to commoditizing friendships and civic interaction, I found so much richness in Putnam's thoughtful analysis of multiple diverse data sources, with plenty of charts and graphs to enjoy!Putnam's premise is that our stores of social capital in the U.S. have been making a drastic plummeting curve (in visual terms) since the 60s. As I understand it, by social capital he is referring to the social connections that make a cohesive community, or on a larger scale, a nation. These can include informal measures such as playing cards, bowling leagues or having friends over for dinner, or formal measures such as PTA enrollment, church attendance, and voting. He presents chapters and chapters of evidence to support his observation, and attempts to explore a few possible explanations for this phenomenon. I appreciate that he doesn't pretend to have the answer, and doesn't present one possibility as the culprit. I also appreciate that he takes a look at the \"dark side\" of social capital--homogeneity and exclusivity. This book was published in 200, so I would love to read an updated look at this topic.Here are a few examples from the book:\"During the fist two-thirds of the century Americans took a more and more active role in the social and political life of their communities--in churches and union halls, in bowling alleys and clubrooms, around committee tables and card tables and dinner tables. Year by year we gave more generously to charity, we pitched in more often on community projects, and (insofar as we can still find reliable evidence) we behaved in an increasingly trustworthy way toward one another. Then, mysteriously and more or less simultaneously, we began to do all those things less often.We are still more civically engaged than citizens in many other countries, but compared with our own recent past, we are less connected. We remain interested and critical spectators of the public scene. We kibitz, but we don't play, We maintain a facade of formal affiliation, but we rarely show up. We have invented new ways of expressing our demands that demand less of us. We are less likely to turn out for collective deliberation--whether in the voting booth or the meeting hall--and when we do, we find that discouragingly few of our friends and neighbors have shown up. We are less generous with our money and (with the important exception of senior citizens) with our time, and we are less likely to give strangers the benefit of the doubt. They, of course, return the favor.\"(183)\"Compared with the citizens of most other countries, Americans have always lived a nomadic existence. Nearly one in five of us move each year and, having done so, are likely to pick up and move again. More than two in five of us expect to move in the next five years. As a result, compared with other peoples, Americans have become accustomed to pitching camp quickly and making friends easily. From our frontier and immigrant past we have learned to plunge into new community institutions when we move.Nevertheless, for people as for plants, frequent repotting disrupts root systems.\"(204)\"The car and the commute...are demonstrably bad for community life. In round numbers the evidence suggests that each additional ten minutes in daily commuting time cuts involvement in community affairs by 10 percent...Strikingly, increased commuting time among the residents of a community lowers average levels of civic involvement even among noncommuters...In other words, this appears to be a classic \"synergistic effect,\" in which the consequences of individual actions spill beyond the individuals in question. In the language of economists, commuting has negative externalities.\"(213)\"Electronic technology allows us to consume this hand-tailored entertainment in private, even utterly alone...As the poet T.S. Eliot observed early in the television age, \"It is a medium of entertainment which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, and yet remain lonesome.\" The artifice of canned laughter reflected both the enduring fact that mirth is enhanced by companionship and the novel fact that companionship could now be simulated electronically.\"(217)\"Child psychologists speak of a fairly primitive stage of social development called \"parallel play\"--two kids in a sandbox, each playing with a toy but not really interacting with each other. In healthy development children outgrow parallel play. But the public spectacles of television leave us at that arrested stage of development, rarely moving beyond parallel attentiveness to the same external stimulus.\"(244)\"With evidence from a single point in time, we cannot distinguish between life cycle and generational effects, but if we follow a given cohort over the years, we can more readily distinguish the two. And the two effects have dramatically different social consequences. Life cycle effects mean that individuals change, but society as a whole does not. Generational effects mean that society changes, even though individuals do not.So before we can tell whether the ubiquitous age-related differences in civic engagement are truly generational, and thus producing social change, we need to determine whether these differences are attributable to the normal life cycle. With comparable evidence across several decades, we can follow each cohort as its members move through various stages of life. If successive cohorts generally retrace the same ups and downs as they age, we can be reasonably sure that we are observing a life cycle pattern. If not, it is more likely that age-related differences are generational in origin.\"(248)\"Social scientists have long been concerned about \"dilemmas\" of collective action. Such dilemmas are ubiquitous, and their dynamics are straightforward. People often might all be better off if they cooperate, with each doing her share. But each individual benefits more by shirking her responsibility, hoping that others will do the work for her. Moreover, even if she is wrong and the others shirk, too, she is still better off than if she had been the only sucker. Obviously if every individual thinks that the others will do the work, nobody will end up taking part, and all will be left worse off than if all had contributed.\"(288)\"It turns out that in states where citizens view other people as basically honest, tax compliance is higher than in low-social-capital states...Similarly, surveys have found that individual taxpayers who believe that others are dishonest or are distrustful of government are more likely themselves to cheat. My willingness to pay my share depends crucially on my perception that others are doing the same. In effect, in a community rich in social capital, government is 'we,' not 'they.'\"(347)"]], "review_count": "0", "description": null, "author": "Vincent Dunn"}, "Timbuktu / Leviathan / Moon Palace": {"average_rating": "4.41", "review": [["Paul Auster is a very talented man.

Having read both, I would sooner recommend his fiction, particularly The New York Trilogy.Anyone curious about Auster's poetry may be interested to know that there are inklings of his fiction, certain tonal and thematic elements that foreshadow the subjects he would later explore in his novels.

That seems fitting for this complete collection of Paul Auster's published poetry, because Auster's subject is the difficulty of translating experience into words. For the last 35 years, Auster has written novels, nonfiction essays, and screenplays and directed a few films, but in the 1970s, he wrote poetry. This book collects all the poems, notes from his sketchbook, his late-'60s translations of French poets, and the 1979 piece, WHITE SPACES, that marked his transition from poetry to prose. That piece, a strange combination of the two mediums written after seeing a dance troupe rehearsal, seems, in its own quiet way, like the summation of Auster's obsessions. His poetry is specifically about the difficulty of describing experience, but can be generally applied to any artistic medium or maybe even any human transaction or interaction relying on language. Some key lines, for me: \"The world is in my head. My body is in the world.\" \"The eye does not will what enters it: it must always refuse to refuse.\" \"The world that walks inside me is a world beyond reach.\" \"The tongue is forever taking us away from where we are, and nowhere can we be at rest in the things we are given to see, for each word is an elsewhere, a thing that moves more quickly than the eye, even as this sparrow moves, veering into the air in which it has no home.\" \"The world is my idea. I am the world. The world is your idea. You are the world. My world and your world are not the same.\" \"... our perceptions are necessarily limited. Which means that the world has a limit, that it stops somewhere. But where it stops for me is not necessarily where it stops for you.\""], ["As a Auster artistic advocate I've read his ten (twelve)novels and his nonfiction The Invention of Solitude and The Red Notebook.

From the get-go I can say that his fluid novel and non fiction prose found contrasts with sometimes awkward, soul-searching poetic moments. Yet his mastery of language, intelligence and depth are found a every corner and hidden in the nooks and crannies of hazy inspirations and expirations.The poetic journey is steady and always requires your attention and your creativity, Interpretation is never easy and you feel that you are always missing something try as you may - a bit like life in fact. Unfortunately this may be a bit too alienating to most and even if there are indeniable insights and artistic prouesses, the lack of clear cohesion and inutive innovation make it hard to relate or correlate.As you read through you get used to the awkwardness, yet you do not find the key or the epiphany of some work that reveal themselves as you go.

As with most of his work, mystery and logic interplay with a stark yet remarkably lyrical style. He has a sharp and clear vision of topics, issues, and events with complex, myriad layers of emotion and meaning as if he were a \"puzzle master\" of the human experience. Auster plays with the theme of chance vs. fate--which pervades his later work--early in this volume, so it was fascinating to see the origins of his obsession--and the genesis of his singular style--unveiled in his early work. Note: Please read introduction first, as it covers key events in the author's life--and the soci-political climate of the 60's--that had a long term and significant impact on his work and the evolution of his career. Reading about his deep knowledge of philosophy also helped me re-examine my own fascination with his work. While many of his poems address haunting issues, images of vast emptiness, inner wards, and inexplicable \"disappearances,\" he also explores deep yearnings for--and questions about--love. If you haven't read his novels, you may want to start with the stunning New York Trilogy, a triptych of 3 novellas that are masterfully inter-related."], ["Deeply philosophical, I liked the later poems better than the earlier ones. All of them show a clear French influence, and though they are often intriguing, I found it hard to connect emotionally with Auster's poetry, in contrast to both his fiction and his memoirs. There's surreal imagery here, and a constant struggle to voice what Auster feels cannot truly be voiced. The end result was that I felt suspended in a dreamlike but frustrated state while reading these and afterwards, isolated and observant but bereft of any deep feeling of satisfaction or real connection.

He came very close to winning a Nobel Prize, jointly with Edison. Tesla was an brilliant, arrogant, eccentric character, full of energy. He made numerous fundamental scientific discoveries, and tried, to some extent, to capitalize on his discoveries through a whole host of inventions. He obtained many diverse patents, but he had little business sense, and this was exacerbated by corporations that often infringed on his patents without offering compensation. Corporations (Westinghouse, RCA, AT&T, American Marconi) around the turn of the century had only profit as their motive, and honor and honesty was not given even a wink. He was more responsible for wireless communication than Marconi, but to this day people credit Marconi with the invention.On the other hand, Tesla was the quintessential \"mad scientist\". He was often far ahead of his time, and people did not believe his grandiose ideas and grandiose claims. The thing is, he often came through on his grandiose claims. Before issuing a patent for \"teleautomation\", the chief patent examiner insisted on coming to witness Tesla's invention, and saw for himself that it did work. J.P. Morgan initially invested in Tesla's \"wireless\" system so that ships and racing boats could be tracked while at sea. However, Tesla took the investment and proceeded to develop ever-more grand systems to transmit radio waves across the oceans, even around the world. Then, when Tesla started to claim that he was working on wireless transmission of power, Morgan actively discouraged investors. Not because Morgan doubted that Tesla would be successful--on the contrary--he knew that the \"wizard\" would come through on his fantastic claims. Morgan did not believe in distribution of power \"for free.\"Toward the end of his life, Tesla made claims that he had invented a particle-beam death ray. We don't know if it was true--but it did get some attention from the FBI and other government agencies--after he died! And his eccentricity seems to be boundless--he hired people to feed pigeons in public places around New York City.My favorite story is about how, in the very earliest days of his wireless experiments in Colorado Springs, he heard three distinct \"taps\". Tesla attributed the taps to communications from Martians. Later he was told that Marconi had been simultaneously demonstrating to the British Navy a long-range radio transmission. Tesla, though, still held onto his claim that he was receiving messages from Mars!This book contains a wealth of detail about Tesla's life. It quotes many letters and documents written by Tesla, or to Tesla, or about him. Sometimes I felt that the book went into too much detail--it could have been considerably shorter without lessening its impact. The book contains some interesting analyses of Tesla's life, and some speculations as to why Tesla behaved as he did. The book goes into psychoanalytic speculation about reasons why Tesla became so eccentric--reasons having to do with early events in his life, when he grew up in Serbia. Tesla was the uncle of the author's father. Nevertheless, this family relationship does not seem to cloud or bias this biography. Both the good and the less-good points of Tesla's life story are included."], ["This book is actually the reason I can't check out anything at the SF Public Library anymore. I took it out years ago, and by the time I started it, it was due back again. But being the lazy bastard I am, I just kept reading it because it was so engrossing, and never renewed it. Tesla was, next to Da Vinci, probably the purest and most intuitive scientific genius ever to have lived. He was also one of the most paranoid and eccentric, but really everyone knows that is a prerequisite for genius. Seeing how badly Edison screwed him over, and the personal hatred Edison had for him, was shocking, not to mention the experiments Tesla did in Colorado with 'free energy', make it worthwhile. Oh, and he designed and tested all his machines in his head, so they worked perfectly the first time he built them almost always."], ["This was not an easy listen. Over 22 hours dense with information, including technical descriptions of Nikola Tesla's inventions!This being said, I am glad I bought this audiobook. It covers not only Tesla's inventions and ideas but also his cultural background, his relationships with quite a number of the luminaries of the times, as well as his physical and mental health. For this reader/listener with no electrical engineering background, the descriptions of Tesla's inventions and postulated theories, most of which in his own words, were a little hard to understand, let alone evaluate. However, bearing in mind that this is not a scientific appreciation of Tesla's work but his biography, the book fulfilled my desire to know more about Tesla's achievements and why he was transformed into a mythical figure. The technical descriptions were informative enough to give the general reader/listener a fairly good insight into an array of Tesla's inventions, including both the proved and the postulated ones.Therefore, I appreciate Mr. Seifer's efforts to do Nikola Tesla justice, separating the myth built around him from historic facts, fairly pointing out where Tesla was wrong, and thus bringing Tesla's fascinating accomplishments and ideas/postulated theories into proper perspective.I liked how the book was organized. It was set chronologically, yet centered on Tesla's world wireless communication system (Wardenclyffe), involving Tesla's desire and efforts to make wireless transmission of power possible (which seems to have stuck in the throat of the electrical engineering companies battling for their share in the market). What I found both interesting and saddening were the descriptions of the competition between inventors, disputes about who was 'the first' and Tesla's struggles against patent infringements. The book renders both Tesla's virtues and his weaknesses, and I must admit that some of Tesla's quirks made me dislike him at times. In spite of it, I found the events leading to the development of radio (the Wireless) most saddening. Tesla aimed valiantly high (ahead of this time), which unfortunately led him to a blind alley and lose the battle with Marconi (though he was able to recover some money in the Courts long after Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics).(view spoiler)[I digress a little, but I couldn't help but laugh at myself when I read Tesla's argument against Einstein's theory of relativity, claiming, \u201cI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. ... Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\u201cWell, as I myself was inclined to refuse to subscribe to such a view, I would recommend Tesla (if he were alive) to read Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore in order to learn how to understand/interpret Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the concept of 'curved space' properly. (hide spoiler)]All in all, I congratulate Mr. Seifer on well researched and fairly even-handed biography of Nikola Tesla. While some of Tesla's postulated inventions, as described, left me wondering whether they were only the product of a brilliant dreamer (in this context, be prepared for a bit of conspiracy theories at the end of the book, regarding Tesla's 'death beam weapon'), the book as a whole succeeded to convince me that this genius deserves better recognition.As my review refers to the audio version of Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius, let me say a word or two about the narration. Simon Prebble's performance is excellent indeed. It suits the times in which Tesla lived, as well as the general mood of the book. I particularly enjoyed how Mr. Prebble voiced Tesla's personal correspondence with J.P. Morgan and others, bringing life and personality to the characters in the book."], ["This book was long. I had my doubts about finishing this one in a month but I ended up wrapping it up in just over a week. Although, that has more to do with Tesla's character and his inventions rather than Author's writing style. Though, to be fair to the Author, he has done a decent job of making the book dramatic enough especially considering it is actually a Biography.It is clear from the book that Tesla was a Brilliant man whose ideas were well ahead of his time. At the same time, book has enough evidence and stories from his life to prove that many of those ideas were not executed to completion by Tesla. It is also clear that Tesla was no genius when it came to his social skills and financial management. This book makes you wonder what more greater inventions this great (sometimes also called mad) scientist could've done for man kind, if he had at least one of those two skills. Personally for me, the best (and partly sad) part of the book were Tesla's and J.P Morgan's exchanges. Frankly, I really do not think either J.P or Tesla were wrong in what they did. Tesla had really a lot to prove since he had no practical application of most of the claims he was making and Morgan was trying to be what he is, a Businessman. The desperation in Tesla's tone in those letters to J.P Morgan clearly presents the state of his mind in those days. In spite of that, it is commendable that Tesla's objective was more or less to bring about a Revolution in the Wireless Systems. It is even more admiring because of the fact that most of his contemporaries especially Edison, Marconi etc were bad mouthing Tesla in the scientific community and were always on the look out for ways to bring him down.Other than this, the other interesting parts were stories about Westinghouse and RCA's formation, Tesla's rivalry with Edison and Marconi, Tesla's views on Einstein's theory of relativity, World war and its impacts on US policies on Patent Infringement and many more. It is a shame that Tesla (and Edison) never won a Nobel Prize especially considering that other people who actually build their inventions using his ideas went on to get a Nobel Prize and also lived a much more financially stable life than him.Overall, I would say the book is good. Just keep in mind the fact that it is a Biography and that the Author might not be highly qualified to give you all the technical details about Tesla's inventions."], ["This was a good but difficult book. The author is intent on putting down in meticulous detail the life of this amazing character and in doing so skips around with chaotic effect. Tesla knew and interacted with many famous people of his time and it was hard keeping track of his interactions with them as the author related stories and jumped from one character to another.The author relates in detail the many inventions and ideas that Nikola Tesla advanced that were subsequently used by other inventors who gave no credit to Tesla and in fact stole his ideas. There are many instances depicted where Tesla is depicted as constantly fighting to convince the world that his ideas were stolen by other famous inventors. There are chapters which begin with one topic and then switch for no particular reason to another seemingly unrelated topic.There are things I liked about the book. I liked reading about Teslas conviction that he could communicate with Mars and how he had a vision of the world wide web and cellular communication. I was fascinated with the struggles Tesla had in the Wardenclyffe project.I liked the depiction of Teslas relationship to Katherine Underwood Johnson and would have liked a more satisfying telling of that relationship. The author simply announces at one point a list of people who died and Katherine is among this list. This is the main problem I had with this book. The organization requires better editing.Another aspect of the book that turned me off was the constant detail concerning monetary and financial problems. It seems like Tesla was constantly concerned with obtaining funding for his many inventions. I suppose this is the plight of many an inventor but I would have preferred less detailing of this (to me) boring topic.Although I struggled with this book, I did enjoy reading about this great man's life and work and would recommend this book for anyone interested in Nikola Tesla."], ["Tesla is one of the most awesomest coolio scientists evah. Totally. Check out what The Oatmeal has to say: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla.And if you're writing your dissertation on Tesla and need to know whether he was in New Jersey or New York on April 19th so that you can confirm that a conversation really took place, this is the book for you. It's great at that level of documentation. On the other hand, if you want to read about how awesomely coolio Tesla was, this book may make you want to gouge your eyes out.I do not need to know which of his instructors at university was mustachioed and which had a full head of hair. Really, really do not. Do not care. Yet I really care about Tesla - I'd love to learn more about him. This book is not the means to that end for me. The minutia killed it for me.I'd give it three stars because it obviously gives historical information that people want, but I'm mad about the way it made me feel. Admittedly I'm not an engineer and don't know a whole lot about electricity. But I'm not stupid - I read a lot of books about various branches of science. But this book was so overwhelmingly tedious that it made me want to read a picture book about Tesla. Or a pop-up book! That would be fun! I just wanted to get to the good stuff, and I felt superficial in the face of this dense collection of minutia. The emphasis on tiny unimportant (to my mind) details lessened the impact of Tesla's discoveries and inventions. The elevation of the unimportant made the important seem flat. I wasn't able to maintain my attention, and also was wearied by the effort required to sift through to find the interesting stuff.So only two stars. Tesla, though: 17 stars."], ["When I review a biography, I usually start by saying \"look how awesome this guy is\" and then rambling about his appearance, his style, etc.Well, look how awesome this guy is. He's like a more dashing Marcel Proust. He's got a handsome but not showy mustachio. He's got that cool oiled hair thing going on.But Tesla's coolness is more about his showmanship. He took this terrifying, new thing called electricity, stuff that comes down from the sky and explodes trees and cows, and he just sits there reading a magazine while it rages around him. Or he'll walk out on a stage into the midst of bolts of electricity, walking through it like it's a waterfall instead of magical death light, protected only by the cork lining his shoes.And it's not just Tesla's wacky experiments that make him so compelling. It's his personality and his history of hardships. He's a tragic figure, the Melville of science, who ran into some fame and fortune, but was ultimately condemned to a life of struggle and a death alone in a hotel room.I won't force you to read this book. But you should at least read the Wikipedia article because this dude is really interesting."], ["I\u2019m still looking for the definitive biography on Nikola Tesla because rest assured this isn\u2019t it.The author throws non-essential information about like it was confetti. I knew from the first chapter when he starts with the history of Croatia that this would be a less than promising beginning. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t get any better. People keep cropping up who had very little contact with or influence on Tesla. Information on his discoveries are kept to a minimum while matters of who filed what patent and when go on ad nauseum. There\u2019s very little real science involved. It\u2019s amazing how many times the author strays off the subject to bring up a trivial piece of data I could\u2019ve lived the rest of my life without knowing. I\u2019m willing to bet that overall more of the text is not about Tesla. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a book about such a creative genius could be balled up to the point of practically making it unreadable. Cripes! Please, somebody write a really good biography of this man who deserves better than the treatment here."], ["I'm embarrassed to admit it, but before reading this book, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had pretty much bought into the new age mythology that Tesla was a mystic genius visionary who was the victim of Edison's jealous, evil industrialist thievery and sabotage. Now, after reading accounts of Tesla's embarrassing social, financial and professional missteps, his ridiculous pleading correspondences to J.P. Morgan (and other wealthy would-be benefactors), and less than half baked journal submissions (particularly the one that interpreted a three beat radio transmission as a communication from intelligent extra terrestrials), I'm seeing Tesla in a whole new light. Rather than a victim of conspiratorial thuggery, I now see Tesla as a victim of his own chronic douchiness.Tesla was clearly decades ahead of his peers. But being \"ahead of your time\", contrary to hipster dogma, is not necessarily a good thing. Tesla had amazing ideas. But good ideas without good execution are about useless, where as even mediocre ideas, well executed, can at least be useful to someone. Tesla was with out a doubt, an amazing inventor. But it's hard not to feel like he could have achieved so much more if he wasn't such a dysfunctional, self sabotaging, grandiose douche bag.This book is a well done (if a little long) biography of a fascinating (to say the least) character from a fascinating time. But the real value of the book is as a cautionary tale of how unchecked cognitive biases (see: confirmation bias) and magical thinking can be the undoing of even brilliant and talented people like Tesla. Be warned; if your model of reality becomes too divorced from actual reality, you may needlessly fritter away your hard work and talent on some really ridiculous shit. Read this book, particularly if you like biographies of scientists, but if you're one of those Tesla worshipers, be prepared to deify the guy a whole lot less upon completion. Ultimately, the book renders a portrait of Tesla that is humane and realistic. Uncovering Tesla's scammy shenanigans, unexamined self delusions and outrageous foibles, while concurrently celebrating his incredible creativity and authentic brilliance.BTW: a film is in production starring (self serious, tortured) Christian Bale as Tesla. I think (brilliant, trixter, clown) Sacha Baron-Cohen would make for a better, more realistic, funner film."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "In the tradition of The Fantastic Adventures of Nikola Tesla, The Anti-Gravity Handbook and The Free Energy Device Handbook, science and UFO author David Hatcher Childress takes us into the incredible world of Nikola Tesla and his amazing inventions.

Undoubtedly I'll purge my grief in a review about a book on grief. You've been warned.Right off the top I will say this for the book: raw, powerful, honest, amazing. If you have any interest in the grief process, READ THIS BOOK.The only criticism that I might have is that there's a lot of name dropping. Insert famous names and some fancy locations (Beverly Hills, Malibu), talk about using fine china, fancy bathrobes from some store I'll never set foot in... Normally, that would drive me mad. (rich or poor, like that one book says, everybody poops!) However, I never felt with her that the name dropping was pretentious, or snobbish. The people and places she named were simply a part of her life, so who am I to hold that against her?Wealth, while it may provide many a luxury, cannot insulate you from death, from grief. Who said death was the great equalizer? It is, truly. Didion's husband died very suddenly of a heart attack. My mother died (weeks ago) slowly of cancer. Very different circumstances. The link is the loss. Didion writes this about death after a long illness (experienced with others in her life):  In each of those cases the phrase, \"after a long illness\" would have seemed to apply, trailing its misleading suggestion of release, relief, resolution. Yet having seen the picture (impending death) in no way deflected, when it came, the swift empty loss of the actual event.I mostly agree with her. But in full disclosure, there was relief for me. I would not have to watch my mom waste away for weeks (MONTHS!) in a nursing home. Release? Yes and no. Resolution? No way. After my mom died, I heard multiple times how very strong I was. What I was supposed to be doing, what should I be saying? Did they think I was callous for not weeping at the funeral? Did they think I was putting on a front? Truth be told, my grieving began 18 months prior, the minute the surgeon came out and told me she had small cell lung cancer. I knew what that meant for her - death. My grief began then, at that moment. It continued each time we'd go to chemo or when she needed a blood transfusion. It continued when she lost her hair. It continued when tumors spread onto the nerves of her arm and she could no longer use it; not to put on earrings, not to hold a cup, not to pick up her grandson. One night, after having dinner at her house, I wept the entire way home, realizing that the number of meals she'd make for me were limited. I knew what was coming. When she died, even though I saw it coming, it was there, just as Didion says, the swift empty loss.She writes about her own personal grieving process, her struggles to resolve his death in her mind. She writes of how very unique it is to each situation, loss of a parent versus the loss of a spouse. These sentences ring very true: Grief, when it comes, is nothing we expect it to be.Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. Didion writes about the concept of grief crashing or rolling in like waves. Lots of psychologists speak of it. The coping information Hospice sent me also mentioned \"waves\" of grief. For me, waves isn't quite right. I'll call them grief grenades. Waves you can see, you can hear, you feel them building and you can tell when they'll break. My grief grenades have hit at moments when I least expect it. Examples: walking in the store and seeing my mom's favorite brand of cookies prominently displayed on the endcap. Hearing on the news that 58 year old so and so died after a battle with cancer. Deciding to purge out e-mail contacts, I see her name. Hospice calling on my birthday to see how I am holding up, instead of a call from her, singing \"Happy Birthday\" off key.Swift empty loss.In one part of the book Didion writes of getting rid of clothing that belonged to her husband. She cannot bring herself to part with his shoes, in case he needs them when he comes back. (magical thinking, indeed!) There were things of my mom's I could not part with. Silly things. For instance, I kept a pair of her earrings that I had longed to throw away for the last few years. They were cheap, old clip-ons, so worn that the color had been rubbed off half the surface. I'd get so pissed when she wore them! Did she not see that they were worn out and looked tacky as hell? However, those earrings I have saved in a small box of other things that will remind me of her. Mind you, I'm certain she's not coming back. I saw her die. I dressed her body. Her cremated remains sit 3 feet away from me on a shelf until we have a beautiful summer day and I can place her ashes into the water at the lake. But I cannot bring myself to get rid of these things: those damn earrings. her favorite coffee cup (bright yellow sunshine cup purchased on a trip she took to Florida.), a potato masher from 1972, the nightgown she wore often in the weeks before she died. a pair of her jeans, ironed, of course, with the crease down the front. Unlike Didion, who could live among the things that belonged to her husband, I had to empty my mom's apartment. After her death, I immersed myself in this task. Some of it was easy. Trash out. Food that I won't use to food bank. I set up boxes for her brothers, sisters and mom, things she wanted them to have, things I thought they'd like to have as mementos. Then it gets tricky. All the furniture, boxes of clothes, the toaster... I did not want to end up on an episode of Hoarders. I tried to be practical and donate what I could, but there is still a corner in my basement full of her things. (A friend of mine said her garage is still full of her mother's things 5 years later!) When the last item of her furniture was lugged out of the apartment, I watched them load it into a truck and I sat in her empty apartment and wept. I wept as I shut the door for the last time.Didion on the other hand, comes home, sleeps in the same bed, sees his chair, his stuff, always there. A year after she dies, she goes to the chair where he took his last breath, and looks at the pile of books and magazines he'd been thumbing through prior to his death. How does that mess with your grief process? Does it make it easier? Worse? In my mind as I moved things out I could say I was simply moving her into a new apartment. Magical thinking.Didion kept her husband's shoes. Magical thinking.For us, and for those we love who are grieving, it is so very important to recognize and appreciate the fact that we all grieve in a unique fashion. Didion points to literature on proper grieving etiquette, how our culture expects us to behave, even giving us time lines for the process. (be stoic! take a year and then get on with it, already!) Many \"great\" minds have discussed the process of grief leading to resolution, healing. It's not that simple. If I may quote another author, Anne Lamott: \"You will lose someone you can\u2019t live without,and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your beloved. But this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesn\u2019t seal back up. And you come through. It\u2019s like having a broken leg that never heals perfectly\u2014that still hurts when the weather gets cold, but you learn to dance with the limp.\"A year after she loses her husband, Didion has not found resolution. She worries about his memory fading in her mind, of not keeping him \"alive\". She writes:  I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us. I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead., let them go, keep them dead. Let them become the photograph on the table. Let go of them in the water.In other words, resolution may never come, but we must learn to dance with the limp."], ["I hated this book. It is the reason I instituted my \"100 pages\" policy (if it's not promising 100 pages in, I will no longer waste my time on it). So within the 100 pages I did read, all I got from Didion was that she and her husband used to live a fabulous life and they know a lot of famous people. She spoke of the '60s as a time when \"everyone\" was flying from LA to San Francisco for dinner. Um, no, actually, \"everyone\" wasn't doing that then and they're not doing it now. Instead of saying \"our friend so and so gave the eulogy at my husband's funeral,\" she said, \"The great essayist David Halberstam.\" What does that add to the story? I found only brief spots of actual grief for Didion's husband and daughter, but they weren't enough to overpower my loathing for the author and her self-importance."], ["\u201cIt occurs to me that we allow ourselves to imagine only such messages as we need to survive.\u201d \u2015 Joan Didion, The Year of Magical ThinkingIn four days it will be one year since my father-in-law died in an accidental shooting. He had recently turned 60 and recently celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary. In 18 days it will be four years since my older brother died suddenly in a Back Hawk crash in Germany. He was closing in on his 40th birthday. He was preparing to land.I had two father-figures in my life. I also had two brothers. I lost one of each pair suddenly - dramatically. I've watched my wife struggle with the loss of her father. I've watched my mother-in-law struggle with the sad death and absence of her husband. I've watched my sister-in-law and her kids struggle with the death of their husband and father. I've watched my parents, my siblings. I have grieved much myself for these two good men. I was reading when they died. I know this. When my father-in-law died I was reading Falconer. When my brother died I was reading This Is Water. After their deaths I couldn't read for weeks, and struggled with reading for months. I was in prison. I was drowning in a water I could neither see nor understand.Reading Didion's sharp, sometimes funny, but always clear and precise take on her husband's death and her daughter's illness ... my experience is reflected. Not exactly. I'm no Joan Didion and my relationship with both my father-in-law and my brother are mine. However, Didion captures in the net of her prose the essence of grief, tragedy, loss, coping, remembering. Her memoir makes me wonder how it is even possible that someone could both feel a semblance of what I feel and capture all the sad glitters, glints and mudgyness of mourning at the same time. It takes a helluva writer."], ["Hated it, hated it, hated it- but kept reading with the hope that all my pain and suffering would somehow be worth it in the end. It wasn't. The same self-pitying, whiney, depressing, self-important sentiments are basically repeated over and over again only with different words. Joan Didion can obviously write well, but she should have left this cathartic piece in her closet. And I'm not averse to reading novels that deal with grief. This one was just way too self-indulgent and redundant for me. And Didion's pervasive name-dropping and repeated descriptions of her wealth and fame just made me hate the book even more."], ["This is a hard book for me to review, as I know my own personal experience will be foremost. A big thank you to a wonderful friend who sent this to me after the loss of my own partner three weeks ago. So yes, this book is about grief and loss. It is Didion's own personal journey after the loss of her husband. The first lines in her memoir begin...\"Life changes fast.Life changes in an instant.You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.The question of self-pity.\"Those words resonated with me profoundly. She goes on to describe that grief is very different than loss. Loss can be the death of someone very close which causes sadness, pain, loneliness, etc., but still there is a distance. Still there is an ability to plan and remember things. Grief however is different, as it has no distance. She describes grief as the feeling of waves of distress, shortness of breath, and loss of memory, to name a few. I cannot say enough about how comforting that was for me. Not only did her words help me understand what was happening to me now, but also what I may experience in the future. While everyone responds to grief differently, there are some general \"truisms.\" One's that Didion has found not only from personal experience, but research as well. I was reminded of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, and her book on the five stages of death. What may seem the normal progression of feelings are often felt in no particular order or time.I had never read Joan Didion before, so I did a little research on her writing. She was born way before social media, and the tell-all confessional types of writing seen today. When she wrote this in 2005, critics accused her of voyeurism. The experience of mourning was still believed to be private, and most thought it should remain that way. I find it interesting that this is the only piece I found missing from parts of her memoir.In much of this book she has written more of the facts of her experience than her feelings. To think, 10 years ago this was seen as voyeurism? And yet, in keeping my own journal, I notice much of it is a recording of facts. Maybe in some ways one's emotions shut down as the shock to the body is foremost. I can only wonder in Didion's case, this coupled with the times in which she wrote, how explosive such details must have been. I cannot help but feel Didion helped pave the way for many authors to reveal deeper emotions. For me, this sometimes factual account did not take away from the experience that is this book. I highly recommend this to anyone who is going through a grieving process, or is interested in the affects grieving produces."], ["I have only experienced the death of a few friends and my grandparents, so I cannot say that the grief that Joan Didion describes has ever been my own. However, her loss of her husband John from a sudden heart attack while simultaneously her daughter Quintana was fighting for her life talked to me very deeply. This is not a feel good, self-help book. It is a heartbreaking and yet cathartic reliving of her first year as a widow. I admit to wetting the pages with a few tears as I read the entire book in one sitting today. The loss of some of my friends hit me hard because I could still remember them when we had spent time together and I regretted that there had been so precisely little of that time. This, in a far more intimate and poignant manner is what Ms Didion describes as she picks up the pieces and moves on. The prose is splendid as many of the themes and images recur again and again as she processes and moves from grief to mourning. I think what moved me the most was the phrase her husband had said to his daughter, \"I love you more than even one more say\" that Audrey Hepburn says to Sean Connery in Robin and Marian. For anyone dealing with loss and bereavement, this is a very cleansing read. For anyone coming out of physical or psychological trauma, I also thinking that this book hold valuable insight."], ["Like Johnny Rotten said during their last (in the universe where they never would re-form again in the mid-90's) show, \"Do you ever feel like you've been cheated?\" I do Johnny, I do. I feel cheated by this book. I bought it because it cost me a dollar. I wasn't interested in it that much. I finally picked it up to read because I wanted to write a review about how pathetic and whiny it was. I thought I'd say something about how now that baby-boomers are starting to kick the bucket they want a fucking monopoly on death too, as if they invented grieving and no one before them could have possibly grieved like they do. Or maybe point out that we really don't need another memoir about someone dying and the way that the surviving family member found some shallow platitude to be true and now feels the need to share it. (i.e., \"Everyone said life goes on, but I had to cry for awhile and then write a three hundred page book making it seem like I was the first person in the history of the whole world to have a parent die before realizing that 'hey it's true', and life does go on especially with the nice advance I got from the book deal. Thank you Random House!!\") But no, I don't get to attack Joan Didion. And part of me so wanted to. Instead of finding her whiny, or annoying, or exploitive or whatever I find that I have quite a bit of respect for her. Other's apparently have had trouble with some of the name dropping that Didion does. Yes she does a lot of name dropping, her and her late husbands friends happen to be house-hold names (if you're household is bookish, maybe yours isn't, and there is nothing wrong with that). And maybe she does name drop the names of expensive hotels and restaurants she normally at in with her John Gregory Dunne, and maybe some people would rather have elaborate descriptions of the decor of these places then her just saying she ate there, or details about what so-and-so said at her husbands funeral, and not just that he or she spoke at it. But that's missing the point and if she had done that I would have been or so happy because I'd be writing a review right now about the banality of memoirs and their narcissistic egoism that only serves to make the author and publisher some dollars. Instead Didion is really investigating and putting to paper the way that memory and perception work under the duress of grief. The snapshots of memory of a loved one don't necessarily contain any details about the table clothes of a favorite restaurant, but the place itself, it's name where it was located is a memory land mine of the deceased, waiting to go off and spiral out to other memories at it's mere mention. This book deals with the irrational element of grief so well. It captures the mundane little things that can emotionally paralyze a person, and it's written from that place which our society would rather not acknowledge and that people should 'just get over', and there is no happy ending to the book, there is no climatic cathartic moment.I've lost where I was going I think.

We all grieve in our own way. This is hers. After losing numerous family members suddenly and too soon, Didion then lost her husband and daughter within the span of a year. This book is her cathartic contemplation of that loss. Heartrending, yes occasionally. Heartwarming, no never. Didion's demeanor is all too cerebral. It is as if she has educated herself above emotion. Certainly it can be said that some educate themselves beyond their own well-being. In this case, we see a mind so removed from the everyday reality of man as to answer \"a motherless child\" instead of \"a nut\" when asked to fill in the blank for \"Sometimes you feel like ____.\" The result, when pushed to produce a book about grieving for loved ones, is an academic's deconstruction. No, it is not without feeling, she is still human after all, but stoicism is her strongest suit. Beyond the almost biting cynicism you get beautiful language, great observations and insights to, let's call it, a different kind of emotion.I assume, and sincerely hope, she never reads reviews like this. She shouldn't care what snarky assholes think of her work, not this work and not after the experiences she went through that brought it about.

So I\u2019ll be brief, as this excellent no nonsense book by Stephen Kotkin is.Why do I think this is such a towering, Shakespearian tragedy? Well \u2013 it\u2019s the almost completely peaceful (that\u2019s the sweet part) decline, fall and death of the only serious alternative to capitalism (that\u2019s the bitter part).The USSR killed communism so very dead that any further alternative to capitalism might take another 500 years. And the guy who can most take the credit for this was a true believer in communism. For irony fans, this is a real treat. By the 1980s Stalin had been dead for 30 years so he couldn\u2019t be blamed any more. Thing was, the Soviet economy just didn\u2019t work. And they had this horrible period where their leaders were walking corpses and kept dying. Brezhnev died in 1982, Andropov in died 1984 and Chernenko died in 1985. So they went for Gorbachev, who was 54, instead of another decrepit octogenarian. Gorby was a true believer. He thought communism could be saved if only he could get it back on the right track.Only a few of Gorbachev's politburo colleagues shared his socialist romanticism, but even fewer matched his craftiness. He came up with glasnost (let\u2019s be honest about the USSR) followed by perestroika (let\u2019s reorganise the whole economy). But Glasnost turned into a tsunami of unflattering comparisonsAnd perestroika reorganised communism into the grave. Gorbachev served up the severed head of his superpower on a silver platter and still had to employ all his artifice to cajole two US administrations to the banquet.SOVIET JOKEThere was a rather solemn joke told in the 1980s.Lenin is on a train. The train grinds to a halt. Lenin jumps up and orders everyone out of the train, organising them into parties to try to push the train forward on the tracks.Stalin is on a train. The train grinds to a halt. Stalin orders the train driver to be shot on the spot.Brezhnev is on a train. The train grinds to a halt. Brezhnev pulls down the window shades and looks steadily at his companions and says \u201cGentlemen, let us assume the train is still in motion.\u201dSOVIET MAPSHow dishonest were the Soviets? In the 1980s:Even geographical locations that could be indicated on Soviet maps were still being shown inaccurately, to foil foreign spies, as if satellite imaging had not been invented, while many cities were entirely missingREASONS TO BE CHEERFUL, PART 16The USSR had more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy or blackmail the world, and a vast storehouse of chemical and biological weapons. The Soviet Union also had more than five million soldiers, deployed from Budapest to Vladivostok\u2026 It experienced almost no major mutinies in any of these forces. And yet they were never fully used \u2013 not to save a collapsing empire, nor even to wreak havoc out of spite.A major riddle persists : why did the immense Soviet elite, armed to the teeth with loyal internal forces and weapons, fail to defend either socialism or the Union with all its might?Yes, for once in human history the guns were not turned on the people. When a collection of drunken old farts tried to stage a coup to get rid of Gorby and reinstitute communism they made one tv announcement and the people saw what they were, which was drunken old farts, and ignored them, and they all slunk away. Followed quickly by the USSR, if a mighty empire can be said to slink away.It's quite a complicated story and Prof Kotkin tells it very well."], ["Perhaps not the most gripping narrative on the fall of the Soviet Union (the author is an academic), Kotkin's book nonetheless merits reading because it advances an important thesis about the causes of the collapse - namely, that the Soviet Union could probably have survived, albeit as an increasingly poor and dysfunctional nation (cf. North Korea), if Gorbachev had not fatally undermined it. The last General Secretary believed, as Kotkin notes - and as Gorbachev himself admitted at the time - in the dream of \"socialism with a human face\" and undertook a fundamental remaking of the Soviet government (including the creation of a parliament with real power) in the name of this dream. When the various satellite states and soviet republics within the USSR decided to use perestroika as a justification for leaving the Union, Gorbachev's own principles prevented him from sending in the tanks, and the hard-line communists who opposed him were all too old, marginalized, or alcoholic to overthrow him. The hyperinflation, widespread poverty, and outrageous corruption that beset Russia in the post-Soviet '90s represented, Kotkin further argues, a continuation of the institutional breakdown of the 1980s; Vladimir Putin was in a sense the first genuinely post-Soviet ruler of Russia, insofar as he ended the institutional dysfunction of the Russian parliament and began cracking the heads of the most egregiously corrupt oligarchs. Armageddon Averted was published in 2003 and it would be interesting to see an afterward on events since Putin's rise to power."], ["Kotkin treats the fall of the Soviet Union as a genuine civilizational collapse, perhaps more akin to the fall of the Roman empire than a typical modern revolution leading merely from one form of government to another. Kotkin thinks this collapse explains why the aftermath of the Cold War was so unsatisfying for all parties involved, and why Russia itself unraveled so definitively after 1991. There are many sketches and anecdotes here, but the most interesting portrait by far is of Mikhail Gorbachev. While often portrayed as a steady reformer committed to a gradual transition to democracy and capitalism, Kotkin shows him to be the last of the true believers in socialism. Gorbachev did roundly repudiated Stalin and Brezhnev, but only to harken back to idealized images Lenin and Khrushchev and their putatively kinder brand of socialism. He believed right up to the end that glasnost was only reviving the older tradition of democratic soviets and that socialism's economy could be reformed through increased decentralization and task force studies of efficiency. (There were actually no real market reforms under Gorbachev, just a movement to give old functionaries some control over their factories and operations. His attempts to roll back military production actually cost the state money since this was its biggest export.) The spiraling consequences of his reforms came as a continual surprise to him and his allies. For instance, Gorbachev's late severing of the union of party and state had the unforeseen consequence of allowing the other Socialist republics that made up the USSR to drift off, since without the unifying party there was almost no constitutional basis for unity. Gorbachev himself dreaded the end of his empire, but his reluctance to use violence (perhaps due to his early exposure to Prague in the aftermath of the 1968 summer) meant he couldn't stomach sending in the troops to hold it all together. Surprisingly, even while republics were breaking away and people were rioting in the streets to overthrow the system, he and his chief ideologue Alexander Yakovlev continued to believe that the main danger to his reforms came from \"conservative\" (read, traditional communist) reactionaries. He orchestrated an elaborate campaign against Yegor Ligachev, his former protege, to staunch this movement, even as his government was falling apart from \"liberal\" attacks from the outside. In the end, Gorbachev proved a master strategist at implementing his reforms but woefully short-sighting about their effect. The result was something neither he nor anyone in his coterie would have wanted. The Russian people then suffered from both the lingering effects of communism and the disorganized way in which it unraveled. It still has not recovered."], ["Very readable account that is focused almost entirely on Russia (I had hoped for more on the other republics). Kotkin is perhaps too keen to avoid the idiocies of right (THE EVIL EMPIRE CAN NEVER REFORM AND MUST BE DESTROYED!!!!) and left (AMERICAN ECONOMISTS LED DIRECTLY TO RUSSIAN OLIGARCHY!!!!), and so ends up with the strange position that whenever the USSR ended, it had to lead to massive theft and suffering. You can't blame anyone--not evil Russkies, not evil neoliberals--for what happened. Now, okay, I don't want to blame Milton Friedman for the state of Russia today, but I'm also pretty sure that things could have gone differently. Speaking of Putin, the epilogue is deeply depressing reading, all about how Putin and Medvedev could make everything better, and how magnanimous of was of Putin to give up the presidency. Perhaps time for a new epilogue, or just time to re-issue the book without any epilogue whatsoever."], ["What it is: a synthesis of secondary literature and the author's reflections on the dissolution of the Soviet Union, beginning in the 1970s malaise through 2000.What it argues: the Soviet Union died from the rise of a young generation, the Khrushchev generation, who attempted to apply reforms away from the Stalinist heavy-industry model. Because of WWII, there never really was a generation between the old Stalinist guard and the young generation (Gorbachev). The specific implosion of the Soviet Union (1991) was a mixture of the coup plotter's ineptness and Gorby's unwillingness to resort to military counter-measures. Although Kotkin describes the implosion of the USSR as a fleecing, democracy without liberalism, etc., he does note they had little other options and reminds us regularly that it could have been MUCH, MUCH worse. (Pointing to Yugoslavia.)What I would have wanted to see: more detailed explanations of the comparison with Yugoslavia--more than a metaphor, but a real systematic comparison. More discussion of the position of USSR scientists, whom Kotkin says were just \"too patriotic\" to sell out military secrets. (Which may be true for some, but I want to see more than a statement proving that.)What's good: the \"rustbelt\" imagery, which postions the USSR economy alongside a global challenge to meet the new computer industries; the language and style (fairly readable for a non-academic audience); the proliferation of points (Yeltsin ruled as a tsar and Russia became a series of fiefdoms under his administration."], ["A really fascinating exploration of why the USSR imploded with such little mayhem than it had the potential to unleash. When compared to the brutal conflict that arose when Yugoslavia dissolved, the collapse of the Soviet Empire was rather mild. Sure civil wars broke out in a number of places and economic ruin ensued, but the Soviet state had the military means and where with all to have created cataclysmic strife when Gorbachev's attempts at reform went off the rails. Kotkin makes a revisionist take that the implosion of the old USSR in the early 90s was not so much because the West messed up, but that the seeds of Soviet ruin were sewn into its very structure. The looting of the 90s was brewing for decades by party elites, but when the Communist party ceased to be able to enforce discipline it just became everything goes."], ["An interesting and in-depth analysis of the events leading up to the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the decline and fall of the Communist utopian dream. Kotkin's writing is refreshingly light and easy to comprehend, uncluttered by the tedium which so often haunts the pages of historically erudite political reviews.Kotkin traverses the historical entity which was the USSR, from its initial formation well into it's post socialist period. He captures well the essence of the idealism as well as the rabid greed that has always been a fundamental aspect of the Russian political ethos.Interesting aspects were the comparative revolutions of China and the former Soviet Union and why one was more successful than the other. The reasoning why there actually was no Armageddon finally, and the differences between political idealism and economic realism and the effects of \"reform Socialism.\"This is a fascinating book, which even for a novice will prove informative and enlightening."], ["A short look at the causes of the Soviet collapse and their aftermath. Kotkin goes over a variety of issues, separated by chapter, that looks at what happened and shows how the legacy of the Soviet Union lasted far beyond its 1991 demise. Of paramount importance, of course, is the economic situation, which takes up the bulk of the book and which Kotkin shows led to the fractured political situation in post-Soviet Russia. Though perhaps the book's greatest asset is that is shows the situation that led to the rise of Vladimir Putin (who only merits a few mentions, as the book was published as he was named President), and is great at giving some context as to why Putin instituted several of his policies, as he was reeling from the situation of 1990s Russia."], ["Very well written but still nothing more than a synthesis of secondary literature and some of the Kotkin\u00b4s notes on the dissolution of the USSR. Liked the book but expected a little more. 3* too little, 4* too much, gave it 4* as I like Kotkin\u00b4s works in general"], ["As the title suggests, what Kotkin is interested in with this book is the question of \u201cwhy, when the Communism was in collapse, did not the USSR begin World War Three to defend it?\u201d His answer will surprise some: he says that Communism was still quite sustainable at the end of the 1980s, with no need for sweeping reform, but chose to commit suicide for largely ideological reasons. The real reasons for Perestroika and Glasnost were not economic necessity or because of large-scale popular resistance, but simply that the \u201ctrue believers\u201d in the system wanted to restore \u201cthe promise of the Revolution and the spirit of October\u201d to a society that had lost any sense of hope. Gorbachev, committed to a \u201chumane socialism,\u201d then failed to use military force to re-establish power when it was clear that such a thing was not possible. This largely removes the US and Western powers from the equation, and thus will not be popular with some, but his argument remains worth considering. Kotkin is a trained historian with a background in Eastern Europe, but this book is written in a breezy, accessible style that makes it readily understandable by popular readers. Professional historians may be a bit less impressed with his use of sources and methodology. Fifteen years later, Russianists will be especially conscious of his predictions vis-\u00e0-vis the Putin regime and the future of \u201cdemocratic\u201d Russia. In his preface, Kotkin argues that \u201cthe best way to understand Russian politics was mostly to ignore the grand \u2018reform\u2019 programmes\u2026and instead closely to track prime real estate,\u201d an observation that seems to have chilling relevance to the US in this era during the rise of a new elite represented by Donald Trump."]], "review_count": "32", "description": "In the Cold War era that dominated the second half of the twentieth century, nobody envisaged that the collapse of the Soviet Union would come from within, still less that it would happen meekly, without global conflagration.<br /> In this brilliantly compact, original, engaging book, Stephen Kotkin shows that the Soviet collapse resulted not from military competition but, ironically, from the dynamism of Communist ideology, the long-held dream for \"socialism with a human face.\" The neo-liberal reforms in post-Soviet Russia never took place, nor could they have, given the Soviet-era inheritance in the social, political, and economic landscape. Kotkin takes us deep into post-Stalin Soviet society and institutions, into the everyday hopes and secret political intrigues that affected 285 million people, before and after 1991.

This was a man who worked with both JP Morgan and Jr. He was a direct rival of Edison and a pen pal of Elenor Roosevelt.I am incredibly happy to have finally finished this book."], ["Nikola Tesla was an amazing genius. He came very close to winning a Nobel Prize, jointly with Edison. Tesla was an brilliant, arrogant, eccentric character, full of energy. He made numerous fundamental scientific discoveries, and tried, to some extent, to capitalize on his discoveries through a whole host of inventions. He obtained many diverse patents, but he had little business sense, and this was exacerbated by corporations that often infringed on his patents without offering compensation. Corporations (Westinghouse, RCA, AT&T, American Marconi) around the turn of the century had only profit as their motive, and honor and honesty was not given even a wink. He was more responsible for wireless communication than Marconi, but to this day people credit Marconi with the invention.On the other hand, Tesla was the quintessential \"mad scientist\". He was often far ahead of his time, and people did not believe his grandiose ideas and grandiose claims. The thing is, he often came through on his grandiose claims. Before issuing a patent for \"teleautomation\", the chief patent examiner insisted on coming to witness Tesla's invention, and saw for himself that it did work. J.P. Morgan initially invested in Tesla's \"wireless\" system so that ships and racing boats could be tracked while at sea. However, Tesla took the investment and proceeded to develop ever-more grand systems to transmit radio waves across the oceans, even around the world. Then, when Tesla started to claim that he was working on wireless transmission of power, Morgan actively discouraged investors. Not because Morgan doubted that Tesla would be successful--on the contrary--he knew that the \"wizard\" would come through on his fantastic claims. Morgan did not believe in distribution of power \"for free.\"Toward the end of his life, Tesla made claims that he had invented a particle-beam death ray. We don't know if it was true--but it did get some attention from the FBI and other government agencies--after he died! And his eccentricity seems to be boundless--he hired people to feed pigeons in public places around New York City.My favorite story is about how, in the very earliest days of his wireless experiments in Colorado Springs, he heard three distinct \"taps\". Tesla attributed the taps to communications from Martians. Later he was told that Marconi had been simultaneously demonstrating to the British Navy a long-range radio transmission. Tesla, though, still held onto his claim that he was receiving messages from Mars!This book contains a wealth of detail about Tesla's life. It quotes many letters and documents written by Tesla, or to Tesla, or about him. Sometimes I felt that the book went into too much detail--it could have been considerably shorter without lessening its impact. The book contains some interesting analyses of Tesla's life, and some speculations as to why Tesla behaved as he did. The book goes into psychoanalytic speculation about reasons why Tesla became so eccentric--reasons having to do with early events in his life, when he grew up in Serbia. Tesla was the uncle of the author's father. Nevertheless, this family relationship does not seem to cloud or bias this biography. Both the good and the less-good points of Tesla's life story are included."], ["This book is actually the reason I can't check out anything at the SF Public Library anymore. I took it out years ago, and by the time I started it, it was due back again. But being the lazy bastard I am, I just kept reading it because it was so engrossing, and never renewed it. Tesla was, next to Da Vinci, probably the purest and most intuitive scientific genius ever to have lived. He was also one of the most paranoid and eccentric, but really everyone knows that is a prerequisite for genius. Seeing how badly Edison screwed him over, and the personal hatred Edison had for him, was shocking, not to mention the experiments Tesla did in Colorado with 'free energy', make it worthwhile. Oh, and he designed and tested all his machines in his head, so they worked perfectly the first time he built them almost always."], ["This was not an easy listen. Over 22 hours dense with information, including technical descriptions of Nikola Tesla's inventions!This being said, I am glad I bought this audiobook. It covers not only Tesla's inventions and ideas but also his cultural background, his relationships with quite a number of the luminaries of the times, as well as his physical and mental health. For this reader/listener with no electrical engineering background, the descriptions of Tesla's inventions and postulated theories, most of which in his own words, were a little hard to understand, let alone evaluate. However, bearing in mind that this is not a scientific appreciation of Tesla's work but his biography, the book fulfilled my desire to know more about Tesla's achievements and why he was transformed into a mythical figure. The technical descriptions were informative enough to give the general reader/listener a fairly good insight into an array of Tesla's inventions, including both the proved and the postulated ones.Therefore, I appreciate Mr. Seifer's efforts to do Nikola Tesla justice, separating the myth built around him from historic facts, fairly pointing out where Tesla was wrong, and thus bringing Tesla's fascinating accomplishments and ideas/postulated theories into proper perspective.I liked how the book was organized. It was set chronologically, yet centered on Tesla's world wireless communication system (Wardenclyffe), involving Tesla's desire and efforts to make wireless transmission of power possible (which seems to have stuck in the throat of the electrical engineering companies battling for their share in the market). What I found both interesting and saddening were the descriptions of the competition between inventors, disputes about who was 'the first' and Tesla's struggles against patent infringements. The book renders both Tesla's virtues and his weaknesses, and I must admit that some of Tesla's quirks made me dislike him at times. In spite of it, I found the events leading to the development of radio (the Wireless) most saddening. Tesla aimed valiantly high (ahead of this time), which unfortunately led him to a blind alley and lose the battle with Marconi (though he was able to recover some money in the Courts long after Marconi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics).(view spoiler)[I digress a little, but I couldn't help but laugh at myself when I read Tesla's argument against Einstein's theory of relativity, claiming, \u201cI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. ... Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\u201cWell, as I myself was inclined to refuse to subscribe to such a view, I would recommend Tesla (if he were alive) to read Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore in order to learn how to understand/interpret Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the concept of 'curved space' properly. (hide spoiler)]All in all, I congratulate Mr. Seifer on well researched and fairly even-handed biography of Nikola Tesla. While some of Tesla's postulated inventions, as described, left me wondering whether they were only the product of a brilliant dreamer (in this context, be prepared for a bit of conspiracy theories at the end of the book, regarding Tesla's 'death beam weapon'), the book as a whole succeeded to convince me that this genius deserves better recognition.As my review refers to the audio version of Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius, let me say a word or two about the narration. Simon Prebble's performance is excellent indeed. It suits the times in which Tesla lived, as well as the general mood of the book. I particularly enjoyed how Mr. Prebble voiced Tesla's personal correspondence with J.P. Morgan and others, bringing life and personality to the characters in the book."], ["This book was long. I had my doubts about finishing this one in a month but I ended up wrapping it up in just over a week. Although, that has more to do with Tesla's character and his inventions rather than Author's writing style. Though, to be fair to the Author, he has done a decent job of making the book dramatic enough especially considering it is actually a Biography.It is clear from the book that Tesla was a Brilliant man whose ideas were well ahead of his time. At the same time, book has enough evidence and stories from his life to prove that many of those ideas were not executed to completion by Tesla. It is also clear that Tesla was no genius when it came to his social skills and financial management. This book makes you wonder what more greater inventions this great (sometimes also called mad) scientist could've done for man kind, if he had at least one of those two skills. Personally for me, the best (and partly sad) part of the book were Tesla's and J.P Morgan's exchanges. Frankly, I really do not think either J.P or Tesla were wrong in what they did. Tesla had really a lot to prove since he had no practical application of most of the claims he was making and Morgan was trying to be what he is, a Businessman. The desperation in Tesla's tone in those letters to J.P Morgan clearly presents the state of his mind in those days. In spite of that, it is commendable that Tesla's objective was more or less to bring about a Revolution in the Wireless Systems. It is even more admiring because of the fact that most of his contemporaries especially Edison, Marconi etc were bad mouthing Tesla in the scientific community and were always on the look out for ways to bring him down.Other than this, the other interesting parts were stories about Westinghouse and RCA's formation, Tesla's rivalry with Edison and Marconi, Tesla's views on Einstein's theory of relativity, World war and its impacts on US policies on Patent Infringement and many more. It is a shame that Tesla (and Edison) never won a Nobel Prize especially considering that other people who actually build their inventions using his ideas went on to get a Nobel Prize and also lived a much more financially stable life than him.Overall, I would say the book is good. Just keep in mind the fact that it is a Biography and that the Author might not be highly qualified to give you all the technical details about Tesla's inventions."], ["This was a good but difficult book. The author is intent on putting down in meticulous detail the life of this amazing character and in doing so skips around with chaotic effect. Tesla knew and interacted with many famous people of his time and it was hard keeping track of his interactions with them as the author related stories and jumped from one character to another.The author relates in detail the many inventions and ideas that Nikola Tesla advanced that were subsequently used by other inventors who gave no credit to Tesla and in fact stole his ideas. There are many instances depicted where Tesla is depicted as constantly fighting to convince the world that his ideas were stolen by other famous inventors. There are chapters which begin with one topic and then switch for no particular reason to another seemingly unrelated topic.There are things I liked about the book. I liked reading about Teslas conviction that he could communicate with Mars and how he had a vision of the world wide web and cellular communication. I was fascinated with the struggles Tesla had in the Wardenclyffe project.I liked the depiction of Teslas relationship to Katherine Underwood Johnson and would have liked a more satisfying telling of that relationship. The author simply announces at one point a list of people who died and Katherine is among this list. This is the main problem I had with this book. The organization requires better editing.Another aspect of the book that turned me off was the constant detail concerning monetary and financial problems. It seems like Tesla was constantly concerned with obtaining funding for his many inventions. I suppose this is the plight of many an inventor but I would have preferred less detailing of this (to me) boring topic.Although I struggled with this book, I did enjoy reading about this great man's life and work and would recommend this book for anyone interested in Nikola Tesla."], ["Tesla is one of the most awesomest coolio scientists evah. Totally. Check out what The Oatmeal has to say: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla.And if you're writing your dissertation on Tesla and need to know whether he was in New Jersey or New York on April 19th so that you can confirm that a conversation really took place, this is the book for you. It's great at that level of documentation. On the other hand, if you want to read about how awesomely coolio Tesla was, this book may make you want to gouge your eyes out.I do not need to know which of his instructors at university was mustachioed and which had a full head of hair. Really, really do not. Do not care. Yet I really care about Tesla - I'd love to learn more about him. This book is not the means to that end for me. The minutia killed it for me.I'd give it three stars because it obviously gives historical information that people want, but I'm mad about the way it made me feel. Admittedly I'm not an engineer and don't know a whole lot about electricity. But I'm not stupid - I read a lot of books about various branches of science. But this book was so overwhelmingly tedious that it made me want to read a picture book about Tesla. Or a pop-up book! That would be fun! I just wanted to get to the good stuff, and I felt superficial in the face of this dense collection of minutia. The emphasis on tiny unimportant (to my mind) details lessened the impact of Tesla's discoveries and inventions. The elevation of the unimportant made the important seem flat. I wasn't able to maintain my attention, and also was wearied by the effort required to sift through to find the interesting stuff.So only two stars. Tesla, though: 17 stars."], ["When I review a biography, I usually start by saying \"look how awesome this guy is\" and then rambling about his appearance, his style, etc.Well, look how awesome this guy is. He's like a more dashing Marcel Proust. He's got a handsome but not showy mustachio. He's got that cool oiled hair thing going on.But Tesla's coolness is more about his showmanship. He took this terrifying, new thing called electricity, stuff that comes down from the sky and explodes trees and cows, and he just sits there reading a magazine while it rages around him. Or he'll walk out on a stage into the midst of bolts of electricity, walking through it like it's a waterfall instead of magical death light, protected only by the cork lining his shoes.And it's not just Tesla's wacky experiments that make him so compelling. It's his personality and his history of hardships. He's a tragic figure, the Melville of science, who ran into some fame and fortune, but was ultimately condemned to a life of struggle and a death alone in a hotel room.I won't force you to read this book. But you should at least read the Wikipedia article because this dude is really interesting."], ["I\u2019m still looking for the definitive biography on Nikola Tesla because rest assured this isn\u2019t it.The author throws non-essential information about like it was confetti. I knew from the first chapter when he starts with the history of Croatia that this would be a less than promising beginning. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t get any better. People keep cropping up who had very little contact with or influence on Tesla. Information on his discoveries are kept to a minimum while matters of who filed what patent and when go on ad nauseum. There\u2019s very little real science involved. It\u2019s amazing how many times the author strays off the subject to bring up a trivial piece of data I could\u2019ve lived the rest of my life without knowing. I\u2019m willing to bet that overall more of the text is not about Tesla. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that a book about such a creative genius could be balled up to the point of practically making it unreadable. Cripes! Please, somebody write a really good biography of this man who deserves better than the treatment here."], ["I'm embarrassed to admit it, but before reading this book, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had pretty much bought into the new age mythology that Tesla was a mystic genius visionary who was the victim of Edison's jealous, evil industrialist thievery and sabotage. Now, after reading accounts of Tesla's embarrassing social, financial and professional missteps, his ridiculous pleading correspondences to J.P. Morgan (and other wealthy would-be benefactors), and less than half baked journal submissions (particularly the one that interpreted a three beat radio transmission as a communication from intelligent extra terrestrials), I'm seeing Tesla in a whole new light. Rather than a victim of conspiratorial thuggery, I now see Tesla as a victim of his own chronic douchiness.Tesla was clearly decades ahead of his peers. But being \"ahead of your time\", contrary to hipster dogma, is not necessarily a good thing. Tesla had amazing ideas. But good ideas without good execution are about useless, where as even mediocre ideas, well executed, can at least be useful to someone. Tesla was with out a doubt, an amazing inventor. But it's hard not to feel like he could have achieved so much more if he wasn't such a dysfunctional, self sabotaging, grandiose douche bag.This book is a well done (if a little long) biography of a fascinating (to say the least) character from a fascinating time. But the real value of the book is as a cautionary tale of how unchecked cognitive biases (see: confirmation bias) and magical thinking can be the undoing of even brilliant and talented people like Tesla. Be warned; if your model of reality becomes too divorced from actual reality, you may needlessly fritter away your hard work and talent on some really ridiculous shit. Read this book, particularly if you like biographies of scientists, but if you're one of those Tesla worshipers, be prepared to deify the guy a whole lot less upon completion. Ultimately, the book renders a portrait of Tesla that is humane and realistic. Uncovering Tesla's scammy shenanigans, unexamined self delusions and outrageous foibles, while concurrently celebrating his incredible creativity and authentic brilliance.BTW: a film is in production starring (self serious, tortured) Christian Bale as Tesla. I think (brilliant, trixter, clown) Sacha Baron-Cohen would make for a better, more realistic, funner film."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "His research diary.
