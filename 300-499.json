{"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (Dirk Gently #1)": {"average_rating": "3.97", "review": [["I still don't really understand how the ending of this book worked, and trying to describe the plot would be like trying to build a submarine out of cheese. Instead, I'll just share some quotes from this book that I especially loved, because Douglas Adams is the only author in the history of the world who is capable of creating them.\"'A horse?' he said again. 'Yes, it is,' said the Professor. 'Wait - ' he motioned to Richard, who was about to go out again and investigate - 'Let it be. It won't be long.'Richard stared in disbelief. 'You say there's a horse in your bathroom, and all you can do is stand there naming Beatles songs?'\"\"Richard stood transfixed for moment or two, wiped his forehead again, and gently replaced the phone as if it were an injured hamster. His brain began to buzz gently and suck its thumb. Lots of little synapses deep inside his cerebral cortex all joined hands and started dancing around and singing nursery rhymes.\" \"On the wall was a Duran Duran poster on which someone had scrawled in fat red felt tip, 'Take this down please.'Beneath that another hand had scrawled, 'No.'Beneath that again the first hand had written, 'I insist that you take it down.'Beneath that the second hand had written, 'Won't!'Beneath that - 'You're fired!'Beneath that - 'Good!'And there the matter appeared to have rested.\"\"'Welcome, by the way, to my offices.'He waved a vague hand around the tatty surroundings. 'The light works,' he said, indicating the window, 'the gravity works,' he said, dropping a pencil on the floor. 'Anything else we have to take our chances with.'\"\"'Don't you listen to anything you say? The whole thing was obvious!' he exclaimed, thumping the table. 'So obvious that the only thing which prevented me from seeing the solution was the trifling fact that it was completely impossible. Sherlock Holmes observed that once you have eliminated the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the answer. I, however, do not like to eliminate the impossible.'\""], ["I last read this when I was really young and was shortly getting off a fantastic kick of HHGttG wanting MORE, as, I assume, most people do when they get on a Douglas Adams kick.Like the other series, every page is filled with wonderfully witty and fascinating and wise (crack) quotes that will delight and amaze and generally blow most writing away by the sheer audacity.To think that Douglas Adams never considered himself a writer! Truly amazing. And of course us fans just snicker at that and keep reading.I admit to really liking this but not loving it as much as the Hitchhiker series. I don't know. Maybe I just wanted more of the idiot and less of the incomprehensible mystic in systems-theory sheep's clothing. What can I say? As an adult, I'm doing an about-face and saying that this might be better by far. It's still wacky and zany and full of oddball moments, but it's closer to Earth... mostly... just not always in the same time-zone. :) And on top of that, it was fun as hell getting into all the old computer stuff and getting into the poetry and the music and ESPECIALLY the problem of the couch.The couch stayed with me all these years and it was such a wonderful character. It almost reaches the same heights as a certain fridge in the next book. Of which I'm doing a re-read next. :)Now, to be sure, I probably wouldn't have done a re-read at all if it hadn't been for the BBC tv production of the same name, and even as I was watching it I was going... \"Is this remotely the same?\"Definitive answer: SOME. lol. Not all that much. Characters, some. Situations, hints. Zany? That's full-tilt. :) All said, no complaints on either side of the tv screen. )I'm glad to be doing all of the above. :)"], ["Is it an audacious thing to say that Mr. Douglas Adams is hit or miss?Yes. (Well, & not really \"audacious\"...)Good. Here is a fun (and I mean FUN) book, rife with what is absurd and comical in certain sciences that dictate what the world is--I know my math teacher in high school was mad about him. And it does seem as though there is an intended niche audience already built for this type of literature: more literary than, say, Piers Anthony but not character-driven, nor truly dearly dramatic. There is much confusion, and this is also part of its whimsical charm, but the coming together seems so tight, so like a mathematical equation solved and, just, done for (although there is that infamous \"to be continued...\" at its conclusion--this is giving nothing away!). I am caustic toward these post-Lewis Carroll productions--wasn't a rabid fan of \"Hitchhiker's\" for instance, but I won't mind reading Dirk Gently #2. When that type of mood actually finds me."], ["\u201cHe instituted this Chair of Chronology to see if there was any particular reason why one thing happened after another and if there was any way of stopping it. Since the answers to the three questions were, I knew immediately, yes, no, and maybe, I realised I could then take the rest of my career off.\u201dBooks by  Oscar Wilde,  Terry Pratchett and  Douglas Adams have (at least) one thing in common. I can easily pick funny, witty, interesting quotes from every page. The above quote represents Adams\u2019 surreal sense of humour quite nicely, I think.Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is of course, Douglas Adams\u2019 lesser known series, compared to the incomparable (but often compared to) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. Still, there are only five \u201cHitchhiker's\u201d books, excluding Eoin Colfer's  And Another Thing..., which\u2014in all fairness\u2014I have not read, but I am not that big a fan of Colfer's  Artemis Fowl, so the idea of a sequel by him is a nonstarter for me.So how does Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency compare to  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? What kind of question is that? Damn you! (Sorry, I\u2019m feeling a bit schizophrenic). Anyway, the answer to that question would be \u201cfavorably\u201d. It does not have the epic space opera setting of Hitchhiker's, but then Adams wanted to write something different rather than retread old ground so the smaller scale of the setting is understandable.Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is not really about the eponymous Dirk Gently\u2019s, I would not even call him the protagonist. He is one of the central characters. As the book has to be called something the title Adams went with is a suitably intriguing one. The plot of the novel is a combination of several seemingly unrelated plot strands. It starts with an \u201cElectric Monk\u201d looking for a Door (the capital D distinguishes from any old door), then the scene switches to a dinner at St. Cedd's College in Cambridge where Professor Urban Chronotis performs a seemingly commonplace magic trick is for a child. Soon after that a horse is found in the professor\u2019s bathroom. A wealthy businessman is shot dead for no reason, and his ghost starts to roam. An alien spacecraft accidentally lands and soon blows up.The disparate plotlines are actually interrelated, and the only man who can find the connection between them is Dirk Gently, the world\u2019s first \u201cHolistic Detective\u201d, which means that he understands \u201cthe fundamental interconnectedness of all things\u201d. Sherlock Holmes famously said \u201cOnce you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth\u201d, Dirk Gently goes one better by not even eliminating the impossible (see one of the selected quotes below). His ability to make intuitive leaps verges on being a superpower.Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency reminds me a little bit of Kurt Vonnegut's  Breakfast of Champions, another novel with different plotlines that seem to bear no relation to each other. I thought that was a bit of a mess, but a funny, admirable and beautiful one by the time I finished it. \u201cDirk Gently\u2019s\u201d is similarly messy, but the eponymous Dirk untangles all the plot strands by the end of the book. For the most part, it is easy enough to follow, and always funny, but the climax and denouement are a little convoluted. If your attention strayed during some seemingly unimportant scenes some of the expositions at the end may be confusing. For the most part Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is a madcap surreal comic novel with a lot of sci-fi elements that you can expect from Douglas Adams. However, a shade of sadness, melancholy and loneliness permeate the last few chapters of the book.The characters are mostly well developed, with Dirk, being the standout due to his eccentricity and superhuman intuition. Not far behind is the enigmatic Professor Urban Chronotis who is much more than he seems, and he also appears in  Doctor Who: Shada, based on Adams\u2019 Doctor Who TV episode script.If you are a fan of  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy but have read all the books already you should not miss this book. On the other hand\u2014or perhaps the same hand but different fingers\u2014if you have not read all the \u201cHitchhiker's\u201d books, or have not read any, or never heard of Douglas Adams, you should still not miss this book. Who then, should give this book a miss?

I thought no-one could write a better comic novel than 'The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy' until I first read this. I've subsequently re-read this novel countless times and it never fails to entertain, I'm still finding references to literature and popular culture that I've previously missed. That a novel can be re-read despite the reader knowing what is about to happen is a testement to any novel but this one can be re-read with a suspition that something different will happen this time!"], ["I discovered Douglas Adams by coincidence. I found his book Last Chance to See, co-written by Mark Cawardine, about animals near extinction and Douglas' and Mark's trip around the world to see some of them, in a box with \"M\u00e4ngelexemplare\" (old books, sometimes not in top condition that are therefore sold at a reduced price). His humour stood out even in the German translation and when I told a friend about it, she told me all about an odd-sounding story about a guy hitchhiking across the galaxy and something about the number 42. ;)Since I've always been an odd duck, I went and bought that book too (in the English original this time) - and have read The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy once every year (May 25th to be exact) ever since.However, despite having heard of Dirk Gently too, I have never picked up these books, for some weird reason. I'm glad I rectified this now because although I LOVE Hitchhiker, this is actually better!Douglas Adams has not just been a British author with the usually expected British humour. Sure, he had a dry wit, but also a mind as sharp as a katana and the observations about humanity that he put into his books, while being disguised as silly dialogue or even sillier happenings, are always very deep, reflective and spot-on.So this story is about the titular Dirk Gently, although that is only the most recent in a long list of names he's used. He doesn't even make an appearance for the first quarter of the book, actually. Mr. Gently believes in the interconnectedness of all things, therefore he named his detective agency \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\".It's this interconnectedness that has to be proven when a former friend of his with a sofa being stuck halfway up the way to his apartment gets bored half to death at the annual reading of a Coleridge poem (THE Coleridge poem, I should say) at Cambridge university, then witnesses a conjuring trick by one of his old professors, finds a horse in the bathroom of that same professor (after it finally got rid of its rider, an Electric Monk), and finally gets caught up in a very weird murder involving his boss, followed by people acting strangely indeed. You're confused? Good!It's a bit like watching Doctor Who and getting all of your brain in a tight knot, but you know exactly that it will all make perfect sense in the end.As I said, silliness abound in DA's book, but all the silliness serves a purpose and that is what makes this book not only entertaining, but actually intellectually challenging and bloody perfect! Especially eccentric Dirk Gently himself with his weirdness actually makes perfect sense - it's the world that is bonkers.Thus we end up with gems like the following (some of my favourite bits that I marked in the book):Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.It is difficult to be sat on all day, every day, by some other creature, without forming an opinion about them.On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to sit all day, every day, on top of another creature and not have the slightest thought about them whatsoever.So two legs were held to be both more suitable and cheaper than the more normal primes of seventeen, nineteen or twenty-three; the skin the Monks were given was pinkish-looking instead of purple, soft and smooth instead of crenellated. They were also restricted to just one mouth and nose, but were given instead an additional eye, making for a grand total of two. A strange-looking creature indeed. But truly excellent at believing the most preposterous things.She tried to worry that something had happened to him, but didn't believe it for a moment. Nothing terrible ever happened to him, though she was beginning to think that it was time it damn well did. If nothing terrible happened to him soon maybe she'd do it herself.... coincidences are strange and dangerous things.... there is a huge difference between disliking somebody - maybe even disliking them a lot - and actually shooting them, strangling them, dragging them through the fields and setting their house on fire. It was a difference which kept the vast majority of the population alive from day to day.This was a public telephone so it was clearly an oversight that it was working at all.Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasn't developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we don't expect to see?... normal English condition, that of a damp and rancid dish cloth ...... he believed with an instant effortlessness which would have impressed even a Scientologist.\"It disturbs me very greatly when I find that I know things and do not know why I know them. Maybe it is the same instinctive processing of data that allows you to catch a ball almost before you've seen it. Maybe it is the deeer and less explicable instinct that tells you when someone is watching you.\"\"And Mrs. Roberts? How is she? Foot still troubling her?\"\"Not since she had it off, thanks for asking, sir. Between you and me, sir, I would've been just as happy to have had her amputated and kept the foot. I had a little spot reserved on the mantlepiece, but there we are, we have to take things as we find them.\"The cry \"I could have thought of that\" is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didn't, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too.\"Charitable, ha!\" said Dirk. \"I pay my taxes, what more do you want?\"One thing I could also identify with immensely was this description of Susan:She had an amazing emotional self-sufficiancy and control provided she could play her cello. He had noticed an odd and extraordinary thing about her relationship with the music she played. If ever she was feeling emotional or upset she could sit and play some music with utter concentration and emerge seeming fresh and calm.Only in my case the cello has to be replaced by books and playing music by reading. But yes, a very precise description of me.Oh, and despite me being too young to know too much about what it was like with the very first computers being sold, it was so cool to read about all the technical stuff because I know from interviews and Neil Gaiman's biography of Douglas Adams what a techie / computer enthusiast he was (plus, from a historical point of view alone it must have been pretty exciting).So you see, not just a thrilling writing style with engaging and quirky characters, but also wit dry enough to start a wildfire that illuminates a wide range of important topics, making the reader not only laugh but also reflect, all while you're having the time of your life.Honestly, no idea why this is rated lower than Hitchhiker, because despite me being a huge fan (I even bought a towel and stitched \"42\" and \"Don't Panic!\" onto it and carry it with me every Towel Day), I am firmly sold on Dirk Gently and think this first volume beats the first of the 5 volumes in the Hitchhiker trilogy."], ["From the title you would think this is possibly about a detective agency. Well there is an agency but they don\u2019t detect things in the normal matter. You should probably guess that since it is a Douglas Adams book and when has he written anything really normal (I mean that in the best way).Nope for this book \n\u201cLet's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.\u201d\nThere is craziness, absurdity, the interconnectedness of all things and Dirk is smack dab in the middle of it all. He will somehow figure out how a horse in a bathroom, a ghost making telephone calls, a undoable magic trick, the cat in Schrodinger\u2019s Box and an alien electronic monk who can believe anything all have to do with one another.It is a crazy and fantastic ride that if you just hang back and not think about it too much everything will just all into place. Most of the time Dirk Gently seems to make no sense until he makes hysterical sense. There were times I flat out belly laughed at some of the general obscurity of it.I will never think of Sir Isaac Newton the same again \u2013 or Bach but that is a different matter. \u201cSir Isaac Newton, renowned inventor of the milled-edge coin and the catflap!\"\"The what?\" said Richard.\"The catflap!

Someone was bound to notice sooner or later. But the catflap ... ah, there is a very different matter. Invention, pure creative invention. It is a door within a door, you see.\u201dI read both the Dirk Gently books years ago and they are some of the few books that I come back to years later and love for different reasons all over again. If you were a fan of the Hitchhikers series or Monty Python then this kind of humor might be exactly what you need for a good laugh."], ["I recently watched the pilot episode of Dirk Gently and loved it. So, naturally, I picked up the book. Now this order of doing things is often frowned upon by many people, including me, but sometimes things just happen. The reason I'm telling you this is that I was slightly let down by the book, having seen (a version of) Dirk Gently in action before reading about him. There just wasn't enough of the detective in the book, while he (both versions) is such an interesting character. And yes, it was a fun little book, but felt a bit random and not as interconnected as it should have been, considering the holistic approach Dirk promotes.Also, having looked into some other reviews before writing my own, I have to say that a) I'm not going to touch on the Pratchett vs. Adams thing, but the seemingly random scenes in the beginning of the book and the time it took to actually reach the main character did remind me of many Discworld novels (nothing original about that technique, just saying). b) The Doctor Who connection - it's certainly strong, then again I'm a Doctor Who maniac. But I think it's safe to say that those of us who can't wait until the next Doctor Who episode (September!) will certainly enjoy Dirk Gently's company."]], "review_count": "2041", "description": "What do a dead cat, a computer whiz-kid, an Electric Monk who believes the world is pink, quantum mechanics, a Chronologist over 200 years old, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (poet), and pizza have in common?

Also enclosed in this volume are a series of short stories, essays, travelogues, and other random snippets, some of which date back over a decade, and most of which have little to do with the next entry, except they were all written by Adams.How, then, to review this book? How does one go about commenting on a collection of miscellanea the author never intended to exist in single-volume form? How does one offer criticism on a draft of an unfinished novel? Indeed, how does one offer any insight into a bricolage of material that, pessimistically, smacks of the publishing industry's frantic attempts to make one last posthumous dollar off of a popular writer?I answer through a personal narrative. Any review ever published is, of course, subjective. This one is more so than even most. There's your grain of salt.My wife bought me this book for my birthday, and I took it with me when I flew home (alone; my wife wasn't able to accompany me) the next week to visit my parents. I read the entire book in one day as I shuffled between airplanes and ticket counters, fast-food stands and uncomfortable plastic seats. Much of what appeared in Salmon... was completely new to me, as I'd somehow never read Adams' shorter works--only his novels. But in short, I was both entranced and maddened: the former at the brilliant intelligence and humor that marble-streaked its way through the pages; the latter at the frustratingly incomplete Dirk Gently novel (imagine if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had only written the first half of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" before suddenly perishing, or if Shakespeare had never completed \"Romeo and Juliet\"). I saw in Salmon... sides of Adams both familiar to me, as in his intelligent satire, and unfamiliar, as in the extemporaneous and atheistic speech he delivered at Cambridge, sections of which forced me to close the cover temporarily while I pondered my own thoughts about the nature of God. Most importantly, through all of these scattered scribblings I saw the inner workings of a man who truly, admirably loved life. And as I turned the last page and stared helplessly at the blank sheet before me, and realized that I had just read the last \"book\" Adams would ever \"publish,\" I was overcome with a sadness so deep and painful that I've never yet been able to even pull Salmon... off of the shelf again, much less read it.Douglas Adams never knew I existed: we never met, exchanged correspondence, or even caught a glimpse of one another in a crowded airport. Yet I consider this man one of my dearest mentors, a man whose writing has shaped the last fifteen years of my life in areas too varied and extensive to number. How then to review a book like this? Simply put, I can't. I'm too close. Even now, five years after the only time I managed to read Salmon..., and six years after Adams' death, I'm too close.Why, then, do I give this book five stars?How could I not?"], ["It's really amazing the amounts of nostalgia that can build up in a person's system before it kinda explodes into a kind of reverse word soup full of interviews, introductions, epilogues, and snippets of novels we wish we had but they were never penned because the author up and died on us.I'm writing of Douglas Adams, of course. I almost didn't re-read this one because I remember it WAS mostly just magazine articles and interesting early computer-tech stuff and ruminations on science, god, and other random bits that fly out of this wonderful man's brain in tightly humorous one-liners that explain not only life, the universe, and everything, but also the way his mind works... and this is all DESPITE the fact that Mr. DNA may or may not have had a functional nose with which to sneeze out those humorous one-liners.So am I rating this entirely based on a man's ability to be clear, funny, horribly learned, and dead?Yes, but it's gotta be more than that, and indeed it is. I loved the man.I grew up reading and re-reading HHGttG about a bazillion times with or without the cheese sandwhich, playing countless hours on the Infrogames title of the same name being simultaneously corrupted and flabbergasted by my inability to create NO TEA, and learning how to fly by distraction.I even decided when I was fourteen that I'd grow a beard for the distinct purpose of giving some poor hapless creature a traveling burial site to not see the rest of the world through.DNA is that kind of man to me.This book reminds me of just how regular a human he is and it is an unabashedly wonderful nostalgia piece to boot. Oh, and we also get a few short stories including Ghengis Kahn, a non-presidential Zaphod, and the opening to the next Dirk Gently book which would have been fantastic, I'm sure, had he written it.*sigh*Still, what a wonderful thing it is. Farewell, Mr. Adams. (Yes. I know I'm 16 years late. It's just that this book was compiled shortly after his death, so I feel it fresh. Sue me.)"], ["I waited sixteen-and-a-half years to read this and I just about managed to get through it without bawling my eyes out. Douglas Adams was the first author to make me laugh uproariously, back when I was a wee nipper. Sure, Roald Dahl had given me a few chuckles, but it wasn't until I read Hitchhikers for the first time that I realised a book could make me laugh so much I nearly wet myself.As such, this was a bittersweet experience. Reading Adams' unpublished work, including several chapters of a new but never to be finished Dirk Gently novel, gave a new definition to laughing through one's tears. I'm glad I read it but it's going to take a while to recover. It's a good job I had my towel..."], ["This technically is the 3rd book in the Dirk Gently series. Sadly, it's not really a Dirk Gently book. You see, before Douglas Adams could write/finish this third book, he died of a sudden heart attack in a gym in Santa Barbara in 2001.But he left behind fragments of chapters or chapters and their rewritings and a lot of other notes on his various computers. His wife, daughter, agent, editor, assistant and other people then pieced together what is now The Salmon of Doubt which would have been the title of the third book.This book is divided into three parts:1) Life2) The Universe3) And Everythingwhich is a tribute to his Hitchhiker book(s).There is much more in this book than simply another story (or the beginning of one). The first two parts are filled with snippets, random thoughts DA wrote down about tea and cookies and computers and other stuff, interviews for various magazines and newspapers he did, as well as speeches he gave for all sorts of occasions.For example, did you know how much Douglas Adams got involved with environmentalism? Yes, this giant (literally) of a man did not just love all things Apple, but thanks to a trip done with biologist Mark Carwardine, he also became a staunch defender of bio-diversity. Most notably, he loved and tried to protect rhinos. He even climbed the Kilimandscharo in a rhino costume in order to raise money for \"Save the Rhino\" (a wildlife conservation organisation). Here he is:Naturally, it was much more of an ordeal than he had originally thought, which he explains in his very unique hilarious way (seriously, I almost suffocated when reading his account of that trip).My favourite story though is of the cookies. Here it is:This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I\u2019d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It\u2019s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here\u2019s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There\u2019s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There\u2019s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know\u2026 But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn\u2019t do anything, and thought, \"What am I going to do?\"In the end I thought \"Nothing for it, I\u2019ll just have to go for it.\", and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, \"That settled him.\" But it hadn\u2019t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. \u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2026\u201d I mean, it doesn\u2019t really work.We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.Typically British. And, strangely, or not so strangely because it's typical DA, a perfect anecdote about life.This book, therefore, grants a unique insight into the author's mind, his anxiety that sometimes bordered on depression, his early years and struggle, the sudden fame and success, the maddening battle with Hollywood, his private life even. And it shows how beloved and respected he was by family, friends and colleagues. I mean, Stephen Fry penned the Foreword and Richard Dawkins the Epilogue! Just the list of people he knew and often also how he got to know them is staggering.Alas, this is the end. So to speak. Fortunately, I can look forward to reading the 4 other Hitchhiker volumes as I haven't read those yet. It's amazing what kind of a legacy this man left behind (not just through his books, but also radio programmes, BBC contributions, movies, TV shows etc).Trigger Warning:This book is sometimes difficult to read; at least to those people who mourn the author, or generally feel for people who have to cope with sudden loss. It sure made me cry at certain points."], ["In early 1998 (or was it \u201897?), I experienced one of the most heady experiences of my life. A literary idol approached me at a conference we were attending in France (it was in Cannes, but it was a media festival rather than the more famous annual event), invited me to join him at dinner and debate the existence of God. Douglas Adams, self-proclaimed radical atheist, wanted to consider God\u2019s existence (or lack thereof) with me. As a minister, I\u2019d like to write myself in as the hero and claim that I at least put a dent in the famous atheist\u2019s armor. We had a fascinating conversation and I\u2019d like to think that I pushed him into rethinking his position, but that\u2019s not very realistic. Hang on! This does relate to this collection of Adams\u2019 writing in his last years, especially those reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt.In our discussion, I pulled out the well-worn rubber duck of apologetics. I told him that he was dishonest in calling himself an atheist instead of an agnostic. I didn\u2019t realize that this was the most offensive opening I could try. I hadn\u2019t read his interview with American Atheists where he asserted that Agnostic did not adequately express his position because he was \u201cconvinced that there is no God.\u201d (p. 96) But I blundered into the conversation with my classic approach that it is intellectual arrogance to claim to \u201cknow\u201d that there is no God by appealing to an illustration in one of Rudy Rucker\u2019s books on multidimensionality. This took my literary hero off guard because \u201cmultidimensionality\u201d was a great fascination for him. I told him that certainty of the non-existence of God might well be trying to decide a multidimensional issue via the limited dimensions we have discovered in our empirical science. Then, I conceded that being \u201cconvinced\u201d was different than \u201cknowing,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t objectively any better than a person of faith being \u201cconvinced.\u201d I scored the opening round a stand-off. I\u2019m not sure what Adams would have scored it. He must have been somewhat satisfied because he shifted gears.He told me that there was no rational need for the existence of God. This, of course, is a different question. Unlike my typical sermon, I opted to walk the tightrope of suggested that God is a useful concept\u2014EVEN (don\u2019t be horrified at my speculation, true believers) if a personal God didn\u2019t exist. I told him that I personally believe in a personal God, but for purposes of discussion, we should consider whether there really was no rational need for the existence of God. I asserted that, contrary to Adams\u2019 hero Richard Dawkins for whom I expressed admiration for his science and reservation for his assertions which went beyond the acceptable evidence, the idea of God was more helpful than harmful.Adams was skeptical (duh!) and attempted two analogies which I found interesting. He pulled some British currency out of his wallet and suggested that burning it wouldn\u2019t warm you, eating it wouldn\u2019t feed you, and wearing it wouldn\u2019t cover you, but that it had purchasing power because the state stood behind it. But, he suggested that you need the assurance that the state exists in order for the currency to have any effect whatsoever. I countered (maybe a feeble parry at best) that, for the bulk of the British population, they had no idea of the nature of money supply, national deficit, budget viability, and governmental oversight of that currency but had an essential faith in the government. One doesn\u2019t have to have all of the economics behind the currency explained satisfactorily in order to use the money. In the same way, one doesn\u2019t have to understand everything about God in order to benefit from the idea of God. Therefore, there may well be a rational need for God. Before I explain the next analogy, imagine my amazement to see the late 1998 speech from Adams that was reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt: \u201cMoney is a completely fictitious entity, but it\u2019s very powerful in our world; we all have wallets, which have got notes in them, but what can these notes do? You can\u2019t breed them, you can\u2019t stir-fry them, you can\u2019t live in them, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do with them, other than exchange them with each other\u2014and as soon as we exchange them with each other, all sorts of powerful things happen, because it\u2019s a fiction that we\u2019ve all subscribed to. \u2026if the money vanished, the entire cooperative structure that we have would implode.\u201d (p. 140) Did our discussion bear fruit? Adams didn\u2019t change his mind about the existence of God. He merely recognized the utility of the concept of God. Egotistically, I had thought to convince him one step at a time, but perhaps, I merely pushed him to fortify and develop his philosophical position to allow for a utilitarian (he called it \u201cartificial\u201d) God. The conversation was still stimulating, especially so when Adams began to expound about Feng Shui. Now, maybe I wasn\u2019t listening, but I thought he was expressing skepticism about Feng Shui, so I said that it wouldn\u2019t really make any different that he and I don\u2019t believe that dragons exist, but that the concept of the dragon may help people design more comfortable and functional living spaces even if no dragon ever sets foot in the dwelling (and presumably they would not). Therefore, I suggested that even if I was wrong about the personal God whom I serve, my life may be better and more meaningful as a result of my conceptual idea of God\u2019s involvement in my life. Now, admittedly, Adams\u2019 hero of evolutionary arrogance (Richard Dawkins) wouldn\u2019t concede this as said individual perceives the very concept to be harmful due to the fundamentalist extremes which have wreaked havoc in human history, but it seemed like the approach caused Adams to pause. Again, that could be arrogance on my part. I WISH I had impacted Adams and this could merely be wish-fulfillment. However, I was delighted to read on p. 146: \u201cYou figure out how the dragon\u2019s going to be happy here, and lo, and behold, you\u2019ve suddenly got a place that makes sense for other organic creatures, such as ourselves, to live in.\u201d Do I think I won a debate with this man who was, in so many ways, my intellectual superior? Naaah! I just like to think that our conversation pushed him in a direction he was already considering. Do I wish I could have convinced him of the existence of a personal God who cared about Him and wanted to be involved in his life and life\u2019s work? Absolutely! Do I still admire him as a person and his creative output? Absolutely!There were a few other lines that I really enjoyed in this book of essays, interviews, introductions to books, albums, and concerts, speeches, and rambling thoughts before I got into what I really procured the book to read, the last Dirk Gently story. I loved his line about art when he said, \u201cI think the idea of art kills creativity.\u201d (p. 158) And, I loved the story about his awkward experience in the train station with the cookies (pp. 150-151). It appears that he was sharing a table while waiting for a train. He had his coffee and a packet of cookies along with his morning newspaper. As he was reading his paper, the fellow reached over, opened the bag of cookies, too one out and began to eat it. Some British reserve kept him from confronting the man for his effrontery, so they actually ate the cookies in uncomfortable silence one-for-one. When the man left, Adams moved his paper and discovered an identical, but unopened bag of cookies under his paper. He was amused that he had thought so ill of the man while he was erroneously consuming the other man\u2019s cookies. And he knew why this had occurred, but the other man never discovered the punch line. In the U.S., of course, there would have been a loud vocal confrontation at the very least. As for the title piece, the bare-bones portion of the unfinished Salmon of Doubt, it was delightful\u2014even in its admittedly unpolished form. I followed the tortured logic of the cabbie who assumed that since people said, \u201cFollow that cab!\u201d in the movies and he, having had a long tenure as a cabbie had never heard that phrase, he must indeed have been the cab that all other cabs were following (pp. 249-250). I rolled my eyes with empathy when Dirk discovered a freezer cabinet full of \u201cold, white, clenched things that he was now too frightened to try to identify.\u201d (p. 226) I chuckled at the description of Gently\u2019s office that was \u201cold and dilapidated and remained standing more out of habit rather than from any inherent structural integrity\u201d (p. 238) I really loved the slam on typical airline personnel speak (Airline Syllable Stress Syndrome\u2014p. 253). I was sad that the book wasn\u2019t complete, even in its current form."], ["What a delight to revisit the mind of Douglas Adams. I like that this is a collection of emails, speeches, one-liners, and rants. Yes, there's the start of a novel in there, that he may or may not have intended to call the Salmon of Doubt. The result is so much better than it sounds like it's going to be: Douglas Adams died, but his buddy knew his password and emptied his Mac onto a CD, the various unfinished writings were lightly edited and printed as this. But gosh, am I ever glad that they did, because there's some exceptional writing in here, hilARious, as he always was, and glitteringly insightful. His projections on the future of technology, from the 90's, are pretty brilliant, and the piece de resistance is the speech to Cambridge on the purpose of God."], ["A collection of essays, speeches, ramblings unearthed on his hard drive(s), one short story culled from a BBC annual, and the titular unfinished Dirk Gently novel. The essays are breezy and witty, often lacking focus when discussing science and technology, but comprise (realistically) the most readable of his non-fiction output. There are some readers, yours included, who feel Adams spent himself on the Hitchhiker\u2019s books: although the Dirk Gentlys were absurdist romps sutured with awesome logic, they didn\u2019t hang together as novels. The short excerpt from The Salmon of Doubt, however, might prove me wrong: the usual warmth and humour is present, although in nascent form, (the narration even slips from third into first person, a sign of Adams\u2019s dissatisfaction). But all in all, nobody who loves Adams could resist reading this book, despite snoozing through the travel/nature pieces to get to the stuff they want. It\u2019s a pleasing gallimaufry. Savour it, because there is no more."], ["A kind of poor book which just happens to be filled with awesome. I'd really like a well-organized and indexed collection of all of Douglas Adams' short writings. Round up all the columns and editorials he wrote, the text he did for his websites, everything, and get it all tied up with a bow and some context. Salmon isn't that collection; the writings are just tossed into poorly-defined buckets with no real TOC to speak of (and let us not speak of indexes), and there's no real way to tell what's missing or what's even important. There's some occasional interesting serendipity to be had, but eh.On the other hand, it's Douglas Adams, bringer of joy and wry, good-natured English despair, and even inferior collections of his work are crucial."], ["If you love Douglas Adams this book is an absolute must read. It's got some great incite into the man who could make a pot of petunias think to itself, 'Not again.' A large part of my enjoyment was finding out about Adams as a person, and in turn finding out that I've got some stuff in common with him. I mean sure I haven't ridden a stingray like he has or written the funniest books of all time and granted I'm not British, BUT we do make our tea the same way, we're both have the same religious beliefs in our complete lack of having them (did you know atheists have conventions? I didn't), and, well I can't think of another one right now, but we're like peas in a pod. Trust me.Plus he recommends some great authors and tells some hysterical true stories. Damn it, I miss him. As much as you can miss someone you never met anyway, which believe me is a LOT."], ["I went into this thinking I was getting a 300 pg Dirk Gently story... guess I should have read some reviews of it first... cuz that is noty what this book was mostly.

Some thin characterizations along with some very 1950sish language, but Heinlein was working his very peculiar magic and this is all the while a fine sci-fi story."], ["I like this dated novel. A human civilization that was pictured or imagined before our present level of computer and electronic technology was even imagined. A young man \"inherits\" somewhat informally a set of \"astrogator's\" texts and then sets out to get \"sponsored\" to get into the Astrogator's guild\", the only way to become an astrogator, someone who plots the course of starships through deep space. One of Heinlein's so called teen novels and a good read. It dates back to 1953 and as I said is very dated, but in an odd way that adds to the book, much as some of Verne's books are. I checked Amazon and saw a few used copies, it may not be easy to track down, but I'd say you might find it worthwhile. If you can track it down it might just be worth a read. Update: I just noticed that Hoopla has an audio version of this and most of Heinlein's books. This book is very dated, and for that reason I recommend you should try it. The view of things pre-solid state alone makes the book worth it."], ["Another typical (great!) Heinlein YA novel about a farm boy who makes good. The main characters in this book aren't angels. They break the law - bad ones mostly - for reasons they think are sufficient (I always thought so) & reap the consequences afterward, but still come out ahead. Max is a hillbilly & has an impossible situation at home. He runs away, gets fake ID with the help of a rough, but kind stranger. He gets a job on a space ship cleaning pet cages. Menial, but honest work that he knows & does to the best of his ability. Then he gets a break & the adventure takes off.The moral message running through this book; do the right thing & do it as best you can. Think for yourself. Great book for middle school through adult."], ["An SF Juvenile originally published 60 years ago, 1953, & it shows its age in a few places, but was still a wonderful yarn with one of my favorite characters in it, Sam. Hardly the perfect hero or role model, he was a lot of fun & showed the main character, Max, the ropes.The age of the story was most apparent in the technology. Max has to study a computer by opening a panel & tracing circuits. Logs were pulled out of the tables in books (Anyone else remember those?), problems were mostly worked by humans & input to the computer in binary. Exactly what the poor machine actually did isn't readily apparent, but it wasn't much. Still, it didn't really harm the story even though it was one of the major points that everything revolved around. It was more interesting because of it. Kind of a blast from the past & a reminder of how far we've come in such a short time.The way star & commuter ships moved held up pretty well as did the almost military discipline of the ship. No women in the ranks, but Heinlein does manage to strike a great blow for sexual equality at one point. It was masterfully delivered, too. Unfortunately, there was just the one.There are a lot of good morals running through the story, too. Kind of hoaky in some ways, but I liked it. I originally read these stories as a kid & aspired to be like Heinlein's boy heroes. I think there are far worse role models. He addresses systems injustice & how a boy with few choices lies & cheats his way into his dream. He also pays the price for doing so, but gets his dream. Rather neat, IMO. Great book. I plan on listening to a few more of these. I read The Star Beast within the last year or two & felt about the same. These books have stood the test of time far better than his later books, IMO."], ["I read a lot of Heinlein's juveniles when I was younger, but I missed this one and it was on sale from Audible, so it was nice to enjoy one of his earlier works, before he started getting old and wanky. Everything from Friday on was pretty much Heinlein getting his freak on, but his earlier novels are still sci-fi classics for good reason.Starman Jones is your basic boys' adventure story: Max is a kid from Earth who runs away from home when his stepmother marries an abusive bum. He meets an amiable drifter who turns out to be a not-so-good Samaritan, but he meets the man again when they're both trying to find a way off-planet, and the two of them lie their away aboard a spaceship. From there, Max's talent for math and his inherent good nature and sense of decency lead him from one position to another aboard ship, and when the ship gets lost, taking a bad \"jump\" to an unknown star system, Max of course is the one who saves the day.Obviously, this book was written for teenagers, but it stands up as pretty good adult SF even today, though it is a bit dated (it was written in 1951). The gender roles are pretty old-fashioned, and while Heinlein's FTL drives and beam weapons are standard sci-fi, you may chuckle when Max breaks out his slide rule to perform astrogation. Still, I think it compares favorably to any genre fiction written for kids today, and Heinlein did a much better job than most writers of bridging the gap between YA and adult fiction. I might not start with Starman Jones if you haven't read any of Heinlein's juveniles before -- it's pretty good, but it's not his best -- but if you're already a Heinlein fan, this will definitely be an enjoyable read."], ["Heinlein's anachronistic elements are often recognized when dealing with technical issues. Other aspects are less obvious. I've lived in the Ozarks area (the boundaries between mountain ranges are necessarily nebulous). I was once lost in a state park. I made my way out by following excessively bright lights to a prison. That was some years ago, but things have gotten worse everywhere. There are no longer any places that get dark at night. (Possibly with the exception of Arizona, where the astronomers have a fairly effective lobby). Researchers on nocturnal animals worry that the excess light will contribute to the dangers to species often already critically endangered. But just try to FIND any research on the impact of excess light on circadian rhythms (and on photosynthesis, as well). And if you DO find any, please tell me about them.Heinlein's dystopian vision of a society controlled by hereditary Guilds seems to have been cut from whole cloth. I don't know of ANY source that even proposed such a thing. Other aspects of the galactic civilization are essentially not developed at all. The ship's navigational problems are used as a pretext to avoid examining the society--but there's not much discussion of it when the ship is on its normal course, either.One interesting note--Max's eidetic memory is quite rightly dismissed as a parlor trick. It turns out to be a useful trick with the loss of reference sources--but it has no greater utility than that. I disagree, however, with the notion that such parlor tricks are necessarily combined with autism. Heinlein even goes so far as to use the derisory term 'idiot savant', which is no longer used precisely because it's so dismissive and offensive. It's essentially a double whammy. People dismiss those who can't communicate well what they know (it's not really possible to determine what they DO know, because of the communications difficulties). Then when a few do find ways to communicate really quite remarkable abilties, they're doubly stigmatized.Many people with otherwise quite ordinary talents have these 'stupid human tricks' special skills. Too often, however, because they fear such stigmatization (and/or exploitation), they suppress or marginalize their skills. In the book, Max is abashed when he realizes that what he can do is considered extraordinary, and he quite rightly fears that he will be ghettoized on account of it. His luck at finding people who can see past the stigma to the whole person beyond doesn't mitigate the fact that the society as a whole can't get past the 'freak show' mentality."], ["While I'm tooling around the world and history of writers I tripped upon Robert Heinlein. I decided I had to read at least one, so I picked Starman Jones. I have to say during the first two chapters I almost stopped reading because I felt like I was back in high school and it just wasn't sitting well with me. Then we finally got to space I got it, I really enjoyed it. The main character, a few extra characters and of course space were interesting. What didn't work was it feel very old. The book it was written in 1951 and I have to say it was very sexist and for someone like me who rarely notices things like that it really bugged me. I don't know if I'll read anymore of his books but I will say I'm really glad I did. Robert Heinlein is an amazing writer puts together a beautiful sentence."], ["This Heinlein guy was pretty good at telling a story.Max Jones is a young farmer, working hard to support his unlovable stepmother after his father's death, but he dreams of the life his Uncle Chet lived, as a member of the Astrogators' Guild.

The books get stolen from him by a deceitfully helpful conman, and then he discovers that his uncle had died before nominating him for the guild, and all his dreams seem crushed forever. But then he meets that charming conman again, who decides that they can help each other get what they both really want\u2014a berth on a starship. For Max, it's a berth as a steward's mate, and he's tending farm animals again, but he's on a starship, and he's a plucky, resourceful, just plain likable young Heinlein hero, who makes you buy into every improbable plot twist along the way to his dream.Once again, great fun.Update, May 2017: Rereading this decades after originally reading this is interesting. It's still a fun story, with the plucky, young Heinlein hero who makes you buy into all the improbable plot twists. It is, of course, very dated in a number of ways. The improbability of star travel depending on a set of printed books of numbers and equations has often been commented on. The social dynamics of Heinlein's world has been the subject of lots of commentary and discussion, most particularly the often quite rigid gender roles, especially in the \"juveniles,\" i.e., Heinlein's young adult novels. It's worth noting that he often (but far from always) subverts those roles somewhat. For instance, in this book, Ellie rather testily points out to Max that women are dealing with the reality of the rules they live with. Another woman, an appallingly predatory creature, sheds that behavior when the ship hits a real crisis and there are more important things to do than play social games.And yet Heinlein never really questions those basic social roles, even as later in his career his expectations of what jobs women can hold expands considerably.No, what really struck me this time is Heinlein's unquestioning assumption that starships and hyperspeed trains will exist side by side with dirt farmers relying on mule traction, cooking over an open fire is a mundane necessity for poorer farmers, and the hobos who would have been regularly encountered during the days of Heinlein's early adulthood.It's a world largely unchanged, not from the 1950s, but to a great extent from the 1930s.However, another thing that caught my attention this time is the way characters, major or minor, may be described in terms revealing that they are ethnic or racial minorities, with the fact having zero plot significance. Dark skin or an epicanthic fold are treated merely as mundane items of physical description, part of the normal range of humanity, just like brown hair or green eyes. There's a loud, tiny segment of contemporary sf readership that claims to revere Heinlein and yet thinks this is controversial when today's writers do it.It's still great fun to read--at least for someone who first read it in the early 1960s. No guarantees for Gen Y or millennials, who grew up in an entirely different world than I did! Because pretty much everything I just mentioned as anachronisms were still real things that people knew about when I was a kid, even though less common than when Heinlein was.For my fellow Boomers, you'll wince at some of the datedness, but for my mileage, it hasn't had a serious visit from the Suck Fairy."], ["I enjoyed reading this several times on my own, but really enjoyed reading it (in small bits) with the kids in 2013. It is the second Heinlein novel I went through with them, after The Star Beast and they loved them both. Come to think of it, it has been over the time that we've been reading this that Lily first declared her intention to become an astronaut when she grows up (with the proviso that it might be too hard, and if it is, she's going to become a \"smoothie girl.\") Somehow that combination underlines all the benefits one might hope for in introducing one's children to Heinlein. :-)"], ["This is one of my favorite Heinlein Juvies. I first read it when I was about 10 years old. It launched my lifelong interest in space and rockets and wanting to be a spaceman, to get off earth and explore the galaxy. It's about a poor kid making good and becoming the Captain of a spaceship through a series of improbable events. Whenever, I feel the need to rekindle that feeling of wonder and need to explore or advance, I re-read this book."]], "review_count": "158", "description": "<b>\n  <blockquote>From the First Golden Age of SF master Robert A.

Heinlein"}, "The Phantom Tollbooth": {"average_rating": "4.22", "review": [["I just finished this book with my oldest boy. I've been reading a chapter or two out loud to him every night when we can manage it. I never read The Phantom Tollbooth before, so it had no particular nostalgic appeal to me. But I'd heard about it, and it was in my house (somehow) so I decided to give it a try. Here's the short version: Meh. It's not awful. But it wasn't great, either.Overall, I found reading it to be a bit of a slog. When thinking ahead to reading time at night, I want to be excited. It's special time with my boy. But instead when I thought about this book, I mostly wanted to get through with it I could start reading a different, more engaging, book together with my boy. Here's the long version: Irritations: 1. No plot or tension. I'm fairly sure the formal term for a book like this is a picaresque. It's mostly just a series of adventures and visits to interesting places. There's not much of a plot. And before you get all impressed that I know that term, I'd like to mention that I only learned it in 2010 by listening to an interview with Neil Gaiman where he was discussing American Gods. I remember thinking, \"Huh, apparently I've written a picaresque. I wish I'd known that about 10 years ago\u2026.\" Here's the thing, while plot isn't the focus of a picaresque, you can still tell an engaging story. There's plenty of tension in American Gods. There's a mystery and action and questions that need answering. \"What's up with Wednesday?\" \"What's going on with Shadow's wife?\" \"What's happening in this small Midwestern town?\" And there is the overarching story arc about the war between the new gods and the old gods. My point is, there's a lot of things going on in American Gods. Many things to make you curious. Many things to pull you into the story in addition to the interesting people and places that we meet through the course of the story. Phantom tollbooth doesn't have that. It's the story of a boy who goes places and stares around in amazement as things happen around him. He and his companions (for the most part) don't do anything. They're reactive, not active, and they're not particularly clever\u2026 Which leads to my next gripe\u2026 2. The characters aren't that interesting. If your main character's motivation is that he's bored\u2026 well\u2026 that's not really edge-of-the-seat material is it? Don't get me wrong. I don't need an apocalypse. I don't need something to blow up. But we need *something* to provide excitement in the story. The Laura Ingalls Wilder books were fucking gripping. There were snowstorms and locusts and fucking bears. Just getting water or going to town was an adventure in those books. Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a picaresque too, of a sort. Every different piece of the factory is like a separate land and adventure. But Charlie is *interesting.* And Wonka is doubly so. The grampa and all the other kids might be fairly simple characters, but they all have personalities. I just wasn't feeling the same way about the people in this book. Most of them were just some clothes loosely draped around rather thin jokes. 3. It's Chaffy. There's a lot of what I consider \"Junk Dialogue\" in this book. People talking without saying anything purposeful. People arguing about nothing in particular. People repeating themselves. And a *lot* more description than I was particularly interested in. I know it might seem hypocritical for someone who wrote a 400,000 word novel to bitch about another author's economy of phrase. But the truth is, I make sure every scene and sub-scene in my books accomplish at least three productive things, more if I can manage it. And let me tell you, when you're reading a book out loud, you can tell when it's full of pointless description and dialogue. When you're reading to yourself you can skim without hardly realizing it. Not so when you're reading aloud to a child. Enjoyments: 1. I got to experience Oot's first pun. I think it was witch/which. I got to see the light go on in his head when he understood the joke. That's worth a lot. (No. Wait. It was the Watchdog. He's a dog with a clock in his body.) He also enjoyed the fact that the Watchdog could fly a little because of the expression \"time flies.\" That said, he didn't get about 85% of the jokes in the book. They were just too abstract language-wise. 2. Some of the concepts were fun and clever. I'm willing to admit that Oot is simply too young for this book. There were jokes about multiplication in there. And jokes about turns of phrase that he didn't know. And puns about expressions he'd never heard. But I don't think it's entirely fair to blame it on his age. There was a demon in there called a Dilemma that chased people and tried to gore them on its horns. You could easily be in your twenties and not know the expression, \"on the horns of a Dilemma.\" 3. My boy liked it well enough. When I asked him, he said he liked it. What's more, he remember the events and the characters better than I did. That said, he never came up to me holding the book and said, \"Let's read some more!\" Like he did with Spiderwick, the Hobbit, or many others. So this probably counts as a pretty lukewarm endorsement from him as well. So\u2026 yeah. Didn't love it. Didn't hate it. The sum total probably comes down slightly on the irritated side of indifferent.My advice? This is a book that your kid probably needs to be 10 to really enjoy, as it's got a lot of wordplay in it. And honestly, 12 might be better.Even so, I can think of a lot of books that are much more enjoyable with a lot less effort."], ["JULYas part of my personal reading challenges for 2017, once a month i will be revisiting a favorite book from when i was a little bitty karen and seeing if it holds up to my fond memories and determining if i can still enjoy it as an old and crotchety karen.fingers crossed.so: first things first. in answer to the question 'does this book hold up?' here\u2019s what\u2019s weird. i have no memory of reading this book as a kid. i know i read it - i remember all of jules feiffer\u2019s illustrations and i have strong memories of taking it off the library shelves and adding it to my stack on a number of occasions, and i also remember it being read to me in elementary school in my AT program (that\u2019s \u2018academically talented,\u2019 thank you very much). however, reading it for this project, it was completely unfamiliar to me - i had no nostalgic shiver of recognition, nor any anticipation of what was to come. the only explanation i have for this blank is that while reading this book as a child, i also witnessed an unspeakable crime, after which i was kidnapped and had my memory wiped, accounting both for the lack of memory and the simultaneously strong memory of borrowing it from the library multiple times.which is fine - i have no interest in remembering unspeakable crimes, and the memory wipe allowed me to experience this book as though for the first time. baby-karen review:adult-review:adults-only this time, i guess. this book is beyond delightful - silly, yes but also genuinely funny and smart. full of puns and paradoxes and wordplay and wonderland-logic, but more sophisticated and less loopy than wonderland - it\u2019s a clever kind of humor that appeals to both kids and adults and also happens to be full of truths:\u2026you can swim all day in the Sea of Knowledge and still come out completely dry. Most people do.sure, there are lots of lessons, like the importance of choosing your words with precision, and the necessity of common sense and imagination in learning, as it contributes more lasting value than rote memorization, which is basically the point of this book - milo is a smart enough kid, but he is bored by school, because he has no framework for applying his learning:\u201dI can\u2019t see the point in learning to solve useless problems, or subtracting turnips from turnips, or knowing where Ethiopia is or how to spell February.\u201d but once he passes through the magical phantom tollbooth, he begins to actually apply his brain and creativity towards problem-solving adventures both linguistic and numerical, meeting many crazy characters along the way, taking some on as traveling companions, like the wonderful watchdog. who is a dog and a watch at once. like the watchdog, the lessons milo learns revolve around the ideas of what is possible - broadening his educational perspective, transcending the limited brainbox of formal education and embracing a less structured, more experiential approach to learning.\u201done of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are.\u201dthis is one of those revelations that can change a person, and juster reinforces it in a number of ways:\u201dso many things are possible just as long as you don\u2019t know they\u2019re impossible.\u201dwhich is a reasoning that brings to mind that alice in wonderland quote:Alice\u00a0laughed: \"There's no use trying,\" she said; \"one can't believe impossible things.\" \"I daresay you haven't had much practice,\" said the\u00a0Queen. \"When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\u201dbut it\u2019s a different treatment - in alice, the tone is just a giggle; it\u2019s silliness in a vacuum. juster\u2019s take is more encouraging and ultimately more useful as a life lesson, fostering self-confidence: \u201d\u2026you had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you will do.\u201dthat is not to say that this is a through-and-through feel-good book. some of the realizations are very sobering slaps:\u201dBut if all the roads arrive at the same place at the same time, then aren\u2019t they all the right way?\u201d asked Milo. \u201cCertainly not!\u201d he shouted, glaring from his most upset face. \u201cThey\u2019re all the wrong way. Just because you have a choice, it doesn\u2019t mean that any of them has to be right.\u201dthis is an amazing insight and i wish i DID remember this book from my childhood days, because lord knows it is a useful lesson and it\u2019s one that many adults haven\u2019t figured out. of course, we\u2019ve figured out some of the other lessons the hard way:\u201dYou\u2019ll find,\u201d he remarked gently, \u201cthat the only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that\u2019s hardly worth the effort.\u201dindeed.the last thing i want to call out is this illustration of the terrible trivium, which looks like nothing less than an early version of slender man:the terrible trivium is just as insidious as slender man - he doesn\u2019t make kids stab their friends, but as the demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort, and monster of habit, he definitely brings his share of struggle to us all with his outlook:\u201dIf you only do the easy and useless jobs, you\u2019ll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won\u2019t have the time. For there\u2019s always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing\u2026which is interesting to me, because i encountered a similar philosophy recently in Arbitrary Stupid Goal, and when i read it there, i applauded it:A goal that isn\u2019t too important makes you live in the moment, and still gives you a driving force. This driving force is a way to get around the fact that we will all die and there is no real point to life.But with the ASG there is a point. It is not such an important point that you postpone joy to achieve it. It is just a decoy point that keeps you bobbing along, allowing you to find ecstasy in the small things, the unexpected, and the everyday.What happens when you reach the stupid goal? Then what? You just find a new ASG.i recognized and appreciated this way of thinking, completely forgotting about juster\u2019s version of it until i sat down to write this review and noticed the parallel. which makes my theory about some sort of book-related memory wipe implanted by hypnotic suggestion in my formative years more or less fact. so, if you haven\u2019t read this one yet, or if you have had your own memory of having read it wiped, get on it. and if you have bred children, make them read it. and do not let them anywhere near unspeakable crimes. which should go without saying, but still.JANUARY: wait till helen comesFEBRUARY: the little gymnastMARCH: zucchiniAPRIL: something queer at the libraryMAY: good-bye pink pigJUNE: the girl with the silver eyes********************************************shark week was so much later this year than usual that it threw me off, so i'm reading this one just under the gun, and trying to finish two more shark books before the week of festivities ends.

In this charming children's book, author Norton Juster takes us on an adventure with his main character Milo, a young boy who enters a chaotic place called the Kingdom of Wisdom and finds that to restore order in the kingdom, he must save the banished princesses Rhyme and Reason.When the story begins, Milo gets home one afternoon expecting to go through the same humdrum after-school routine he always goes through. But on this particular day, he arrives home to find a tollbooth waiting to transport him to a faraway place. Soon, Milo is traveling through the Kingdom of Wisdom, seeking to rescue Rhyme and Reason with the help of his companions, Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug.Along the way, Milo meets some interesting and clever characters, such as the Whether Man (not to be confused with the Weather Man, \"for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be\") and Kakofonous Dischord, Doctor of Dissonance, whom Milo meets on the outskirts of the Valley of Sound. Page after page, Juster's clever puns and witty plays on words make his characters memorable and his storyline entertaining.On his journey, Milo travels to several places within the Kingdom of Wisdom, learning useful things along the way. In Dictionopolis, for instance, he discovers the abundance of words and the importance of choosing the right word for the right occasion. On his way to Digitopolis, a land ruled by numbers, Milo ends up on the Island of Conclusions. There, he decides to himself, \"From now on, I'm going to have a very good reason before I make up my mind about anything,\" and he learns that \"you can lose too much time jumping to Conclusions.\"Armed with the knowledge he has gathered on his journey through the Kingdom, Milo finally reaches the Mountains of Ignorance, where he and his faithful companions dodge and outwit various demons and ultimately save the princesses Rhyme and Reason. In the end, Milo is transported back to the present with a newfound curiosity about the world and a greater appreciation for learning.Juster's humor throughout the story is at times subtle, at times downright silly, but often clever and thought-provoking, making this book an enjoyable read for young and old alike. They say there's a child in all of us, and The Phantom Tollbooth truly is a children's book for all ages."], ["I am a reader, and I measure my life in books, and the ones that I read in my very early years were probably the most formative. You can learn a lot about a person by what their childhood was like- whether they played outside all the time or preferred to stay indoors, whether they read or didn't, whether they drew or played sports or learned instruments and languages.I, for one, loved words. I read many books with large words in them, and so I was always asking my mother what they meant, or looking them up in the dictionary, or trying to just guess. I loved long words, short words, words that were fun to say. I would spell them, write them down, sometimes just say them aloud in strings of total gibberish. Even as a child, I remember being amazed that I could make sounds with my mouth that other people could recognise and understand. The idea that I could say the word \"apple,\" which really is an odd word when you look at it long enough, and that somebody else would know exactly what I was referring to was thrilling.I used to play a word association game I made up where I would think of a word, then think of a word associated with that word, then a word associated with that word, and on and on until I either tried to get back to the word I started with or tried to see how far I could deviate from my original word. So a game might start with the word \"pencil\" and go from there to \"paper,\" \"bag,\" \"rag,\" \"towel,\" \"trowel,\" \"garden,\" \"green,\" \"leaf,\" \"tree,\" \"wood,\" \"paper.\" Or I might start with \"pencil\" and go to \"lead,\" \"bed,\" \"jumping,\" \"kangaroo,\" \"pouch,\" \"couch,\" \"sofa,\" \"soda,\" \"bubbles.\" This all took place in my brain, and sometimes I'd just sit in my room for hours and do this. (I would be lying if I said I didn't still do it occasionally.)I loved books, too. I loved the idea that somebody could put words down on paper and that I could create a world in my mind based off of those words. From a young age, I followed characters, tried to predict plots, and lived in that lovely world somewhere between reality and imagination that we call literature.All of this boils down to the fact that, to me, language was a playground. I'd make up words, speak backwards, sometimes go whole stretches of time just spelling out words instead of speaking, like \"H-E-L-L-O (space) M-O-M (comma) H-O-W (space) A-R-E (space) Y-O-U (space) D-O-I-N-G (question mark)?\" Punctuation, spelling, even fonts and typeface and foreign languages- everything related to words was something I was fond of.And it all started with The Phantom Tollbooth.Well, not exactly. I'd been doing a lot of this stuff even before I read the book, but The Phantom Tollbooth really helped to make these qualities stick with me.Why? Because I felt the way I do whenever I find a great book: that I'm not alone. Norton Juster, through wordplay and illustrations and wit, showed me that language, and, to an even greater extent, knowledge, was a wonderful thing. As I read this book and travelled among the Whether Man, Princess Rhyme and Princess Reason, the Mathemagician, and King Azaz the Unabridged, as I read riddles and jokes and equations and utter nonsense and wise advice and snatches of song, as I ventured with Milo and Tock into the Doldrums and the Lands Beyond, to Dictionopolis and Digitopolis and up over the Mountains of Ignorance, I recognised myself in all of these things, and each one of them told me that I wasn't weird for loving language and reading compulsively and making up words and collecting utterly useless facts. Or more accurately, they told me that I was weird- but that there aren't enough weird people in the world who commit themselves to these things, so it was okay.You can learn a lot about a person based on the books on their bookshelf: whether they're pristine or worn, whether they're organised or not, whether they've got notes written in the margins or flowers pressed between the covers or the signatures of authors. And if you were to look at my pitifully small bookshelf (the rest of my books reside in two enormous stacks by my bed), you would find a worn, torn, stained, and utterly beloved copy of The Phantom Tollbooth. And perhaps you would be able to tell, just by looking at it, that it taught me one of the most important lessons I've learned: that imagination is a beautiful thing, and even if you think that you're too old for things like word games and math equations and fun facts and puns and stories- things, in short, that bring you knowledge and delight, even if you think you've outgrown them... Deep down, they will never outgrow you."], ["The Phantom Tollbooth is--without doubt--the funnest book I've ever read. Not only did I love this book as a kid, but I love it even more the older I get.It has enough of a save-the-princess plot to hold your attention, a cast of Pixar-like zany characters, and it's set in a world so riddled with puns it's unbelievably fun.From the way the tollbooth mysteriously arrives, to the way it takes Milo to a strange new world, to the quest he ends up on to save the princesses Rhyme and Reason, to how he ultimately returns home--this story never stops surprising, never stops intriguing, and definitely--not for a word--does it stop being fun."], ["I wasn't as impressed with this book as many of my friends. Perhaps that is because of my high expectations for the book or perhaps because of my preferences in writing style. So those who love this book can use one of those two reasons to blow off my review. However, the fact remains that I was not very interested from page to page, and if not for a commitment to a book group, I am afraid I would not have had any desire to finish it.In style the book seems to be written for a particular age group ranging from 8-11, depending on the vocabulary and maturity of the reader. And, for the preteen sense of humor, the wordplay was appropriate and would be quite funny to the intended audience. However, the wordplay was really the only interesting aspect to the book, and I'm tempted to say as much for the joke books my niece reads to me. The plot was simple and was secondary to both the wordplay and the multiple morals of the story. In fact, a new moral was introduced with every chapter (some chapters containing more than one moral), and each chapter was only a few short pages long. This was the main drawback to the book. Not to say that morals aren't important in a work, but too many morals are detracting. Introducing, then immediately leaving a moral behind decreases the likeliness that it will be remembered once the book is finished. My other main problem with the book was the lack of description to help the reader enjoy the fantastical and quite creative world Juster introduces. Here one moment, and there the next, the reader is left wondering...How did Milo find his car again (he was lost only a moment ago)? Where are they? What do they see? This book, whose main moral is to teach a child to notice the world around them, simply forgot to take a look around. (The spectacular scene with Chroma and his orchestra being the exception.)Overall, an interesting book, leaps and bounds above the other children's literature of Juster's contemporaries, but not my favorite."], ["Reading \"grown-up\" literature is excavating the human soul, the adult soul: a mangled mess of contradictions and self-deceptions, screwy motives and the odd self-adherent logic of artistic creation. But Literature (capital ell) is a pyrrhic battle between message and evasion: one must avoid moralizing outright, must avoid overt allegory, but must never be too subtle, too veiled, lest you be resigned to snobby undergrabs and many rubbish bins. The Phantom Tollbooth is a strange beast: decidedly accessible to children, but remains lovable to adults. It's championing of the struggle against moral short-cuts, boredom, and mental waste is timeless, ageless, and remains prescient, even to me: a grown person 52 years after it's publication!My grandmother has always said: \"only boring people get bored\" - I am guilty of sometimes serving this packaged wit cold when a friend laments \"I'm bored!\" but I think forcefully throwing this book at them would be a better remedy. What is signifed in my grandmother's aphorism is that interested people are interesting, and more importantly are never idle. My family (paternal side) is a hard-working, conservative, New Englander family: we don't watch much television, we read lots of books, we listen to NPR and read the Wall Street Journal, we somewhat self-indulgently talk about the cultural decline in literacy and how we are not a part of it. But the story of Milo is one which is both entertaining, lovable, but also cautionary. By no means is Milo a bad child, a dull idler, but rather he has not found passion yet. He is bored because his urban living, his deadening routine has stayed access to the bliss of potentiality. \nThe only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that's hardly worth the effort.\nWe are plagued, as a modern, urban society by the two-headed monster of routine. Routine comforts us, it gives us an escape into the dull and Terrible Trivium: the small tasks which comfort us and distract us from important, difficult work and choices. Our society is filled with spineless and indecisive people (the Gelatinous Giant) and those who feed us half-truths, who coddle us into a mire, into a trap (Monster of Insincerity): they are not villains, and these flaws do not define all people, but are characteristic in turn. Our weaknesses, our daemons, are our horrible defenses, our cozy citadels in the mountains of Ignorance. It is not the absence of bad habits (hours of dull television, bad reading or no reading) that marks an individual's decline, but rather the presence, the support, of our defenses. The demons of the mountains of Ignorance are impotent without our compliance, they feed on our weakness for what is easy. If we allow the glittering sovereigns of Rhyme and Reason to go fugitive in their empyrean prison, we lose our grip on true happiness, we become boring, we become easily bored. Thankfully, there is nothing boring in The Phantom Tollbooth: its play with language is unrivaled certainly in children/young-adult literature, and rivals even the masters of play (Joyce, Nabokov, etc) in the grander schema. With a dual reverence for words and numbers, rhyme and reason, and a prevailing apotheosis of time, beyond the value of currency: something never to be wasted, Juster champions all forms of mental activity and cerebral play. I can imagine no better way to introduce a bored student, particularly one ahead of his class, to the ever-infinite vistas of imagination and invention than to hand him or her this book. \n\u201cIt has been a long trip,\" said Milo, climbing onto the couch where the princesses sat; \"but we would have been here much sooner if I hadn't made so many mistakes.

At the beginning of the story, Milo is a bored young man who does not care much for anything, and can't see any point in learning, discarding knowledge and understanding as quite useless. During his journey into increasingly absurd adventures, however, he slowly but steadily sharpens his mind and wit, and starts thinking for himself, reflecting on different perspectives of reality. The biggest midget in the world happens to be the smallest giant in the world at the same time, and Milo would not have thought of either title for the man who appears absolutely average to him. In Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, he learns about the peculiarities of language and maths, and about the complexity of thought that is the basis for our means of communication.In the end, when Milo has developed into a curious, mature boy who cherishes the adventure of learning, he receives a final lesson from all the crazy characters in the story:\u201cAs the cheering continued, Rhyme leaned forward and touched Milo gently on the shoulder. \"They're cheering for you,\" she said with a smile. \"But I could never have done it,\" he objected, \"without everyone else's help.\" \"That may be true,\" said Reason gravely, \"but you had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you *will* do.\" \"That's why,\" said Azaz, \"there was one very important thing about your quest that we couldn't discuss until you returned. \"I remember,\" said Milo eagerly. \"Tell me now.\" \"It was impossible,\" said the king, looking at the Mathemagician. \"Completely impossible,\" said the Mathemagician, looking at the king. \"Do you mean----\" said the bug, who suddenly felt a bit faint. \"Yes, indeed,\" they repeated together; \"but if we'd told you then, you might not have gone---and, as you've discovered, so many things are possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible.\" And for the remainder of the ride Milo didn't utter a sound.\u201dI read this book aloud to a Grade 7 a couple of years ago, and later, when they were in Grade 9, they told me it was still their favourite book, and one they would never have read through or understood without the joint effort of the class, as it is a story requiring a high level of language skills as well as general understanding of how to motivate learning and generate curiosity. Just like Milo in the story, some students might have given up in the middle if they had not shared and cheered each other on. It is not a simple mainstream, straightforward plot.One of the completely impossible tasks in the book was described by the author in an afterword. He had had a conflict with his illustrator who refused to draw a required situation in the book. He claimed it to be impossible. The drawing was supposed to show the following: \"Three demons, one tall and thin, the second short and fat, and the third exactly the same as the other two!\"My students and I gave ourselves the task to create the drawing, and there were as many different results as there were participants in the activity. But we solved it: \"I'm possible\", we wrote underneath. It is one of my favourite memories of reading with students, and I highly recommend the book to grown-ups and children alike: if you are not satisfied, after all, wasted time will be refunded!"]], "review_count": "2", "description": "Hailed as \u201ca classic. . . . humorous, full of warmth and real invention\u201d (The New Yorker), this beloved story -first published more than fifty years ago- introduces readers to Milo and his adventures in the Lands Beyond. <br /><br />For Milo, everything\u2019s a bore.

Alas, despite my high hopes going in, that's exactly what it is. To start with, there are the small issues, such as the fact that, having been written in 2005, most of the content and especially tone of this book is hopelessly dated by today's standards - anything bitching about the Bush administration is just hopelessly passe these days, and the fact that the author didn't like the bullshit-laden cynicism of that administration seems to be pretty much the entire point of this book, at a time when such sentiments were hardly unique. With the exception of a few mildly interesting \"organization of knowledge\" type ideas about the nature of bullshit in the first few pages, there isn't a single thought in this book that someone else hadn't already thought of by 2005. This would be fine if not for Penny's annoying habit of turning every. single. sentence. into a series of rhetorical flourishes in a tone that screams \"look at how clever and edgy I am\", but mostly just succeeds in conveying that she's trying too hard to be clever and edgy. This makes her writing not only difficult to scan but tiresome to actually read. I would've been willing to forgive this transgression, though, if not for the much larger issue that Penny makes no effort whatsoever to be anything but derivative of all of the other anti-Bush screeds circulating at the time, or to actually show that she is capable of using her education in any way other than appealing to that laziest common denominator of Bush-era liberal discontent. Absolutely no attempt is made at any time to cite any actual facts or to make any original contribution beyond the first few pages. It should therefore come as no surprise that Penny's argument is riddled with factual errors. At first, it's just minor, annoying things such as referring to her disdain for commercials featuring a nonexistent SUV called the \"Chevrolet Tacoma\", but as the book goes on she starts misquoting history in ways that undermine her argument (e.g. misidentifying both Jamestown and New England as being essentially corporate constructions from the beginning, when New England was no such thing.) and assuming that the reader has never heard of and apparently will never hear of James Comey, who as of this writing is head of the FBI. [May 2017 update: No one will ever hear of James Comey? Never ever? Hoo boy...]If Penny had made errors like this once or twice it would be forgivable, but she does it so often that it undermines her credibility, since mostly these are errors that would require about a minute of Google time in order to fix. Dude, if Al Franken could cite his sources for the anti-Bush screeds he produced during this period, so can you. That this sort of shoddy, mass-produced work should appear in a one-dimensional liberal screed about how shoddy and mass-produced our culture has become is as ironic as it is sad, because it doesn't challenge the premise that even our \"intellectual\" polemics in opposition to mass-produced bullshit have to be mass-produced bullshit in and of themselves. Despite its initial intentions, this book is ultimately a product of the very same corporate profiteering and societal attention span issues that Penny herself is railing against. It exists not because Penny is a brilliant, or even coherent author, but simply because there was a market for this sort of writing in 2005, so someone published it to cash in, seeing the potential market of 59,028,444 (John Kerry's share of the 2004 electorate) US citizens alone who were dissatisfied with the then-present administration. Penny's failure to recognize this, as well as the unfortunately dated nature of many of these observations, is really what makes this book so insufferable. It also explains why, when I bought this book shortly after Obama took office, it was out of a stack of about two dozen remainders. It's a shame, because there are some good ideas recycled here, and even a handful of entertaining witticisms, but ultimately this is just not a book that will appeal to most people this far after the fact, at least if you want anything more than superficial affirmation that your dislike of George W.

Instead it was mostly a now-dated rant about the Bush administration."], ["A self-styled rant about the frustrations of modern society11 October 2013\tThere is not all that much that sets this book apart from all of the other anti-corporate books that have been released, except that at the end the writer says that this is not so much a book to help us look for a way forward and a way to get out of this mess that we have found ourselves in, but rather as a means to vent her frustration over the ever encroaching corporate and technocratic domination of our lives. The thing is that Penny doesn't actually say anything new in this book, and does not really point out anything that we don't already know, and there are much better books out there that do just that (such as Naomi Klein's No Logo).\tThe thing about the corporation is that there are two sides to every issue. Corporations are able to raise huge amounts of capital to be able to produce things that normal people like us are not able. They are also able to make life easier and to provide avenues for us to be able to get things that we like and need. Without the corporation we would not have supermarkets, or multiplex cinemas, or even the vehicle to get you to these places.\tOn the flip side, they have what is effectively unfettered power of control. Corporations control what we see and what we do. With the amount of money they are able to raise they are able to influence governments and elections. We have seen this recently in Australia where one media company pretty much dictated the election result by printing newspaper articles with views that they wanted people to see. For instance, opposition leader was pictured as the saviour that Australia needed while every move that the government made was plastered everywhere, and was given a negative twist (while this has been the case for a long time with elections, it has never been to this extent previously in Australia). Now, what we have is a government that is effectively secret and media shy, and bowing to corporate interests for what they believe is in the best interests of the country.\tThere is one thing that I have noticed that is coming out of this recent election and that is a law banning boycotts. This law is clearly aimed at promoting and protecting corporate interests and denying the citizens of Australia the right to freedom of speech. The question is how is this law going to be implemented. Am I going to be forced to eat at McDonalds, and am I going to be forced to do all of my shopping at one of the major supermarkets because if I don't it will be considered a boycott. Or is this law going to fall flat on its face because there is no way to actually determine whether a consumer's buying behaviour is a boycott or simply choice.\tAnother thing this book raises is the idea of the phone maze. I work in a glorified call center (meaning that we need to have decent training to be able to work where we are working) and the idea of the phone maze is to try and direct us to where we want to go. With the number of calls I make out, I encounter either the switchboard, or the phone maze. Having navigated lots of phone mazes, one becomes proficient in getting to where you want to go, or at least working out how to speak to a person because a computer simply has no intelligence and only responds to commands. Otherwise you hit the switchboard which, unless you are ultra-specific, they end up sending you to the wrong department anyway.\tOne thing that I notice in my workplace is how people are being forced to specialise. The work duties are slowly being narrowed down in the same way that the manufacturing sector has narrowed down the tasks that the workers perform. Before the industrial revolution, blacksmiths used to be multi-skilled, however now all you do is the same repetitive task day in and day out. The same is the case with office work, and with file management, as the specific tasks on each file are farmed out to specialists. Being somebody who likes variety in my work, and to be able to be challenged from multiple different sectors, this is something that I do not particularly like."], ["With the Western world choking on its own bullshit, watching things fall apart because we've believed our own lines, Laura Penny rides to the rescue, shovel in hand, to help us dig ourselves out.

I really enjoyed the way the each letter has several references in the pictures, so not only are you understanding that the letter is at the end of every word, but your trying to find others on the page that do the same. The illustrations are cartoonish in nature but for a younger child I believe these would keep them interested and entertained trying to spot everything. The colors are vibrant and themed throughout the title.The only negative or maybe I shouldn't say negative, but words of advise that I have for A is for Zebra is don't let your child read this or read it to them unless they are completely comfortable with knowing their letters and know the correct order they are in. I think back when I was a kid and having dyslexia I already had a hard time understanding the order of things and the correct way of writing them. If your child is struggling with any of it or just got it down, perhaps give them a bit more time before introducing this title to them. I'm not saying I believe they can't handle it, just know going in that it may confuse them a bit. This book really is an alphabetic backward experience.I recommend for any child who has their alphabet down without looking at them and who is starting to read on their own. I know that may not seem fair, but truthfully I wouldn't be reading this title to my kids without them being able to tell me the alphabet without having to look at something with them on it and could tell me which letter I'm holding up on a gumbled deck of flashcards. Kids have a lot on their plates to remember and I don't want to be an additional set back!Originally posted: http://tiffanyfoxbooks.blogspot.com/2..."], ["Sandra C ArguetaETEC 545March 3, 2016 Concept Book ReviewShulman, Mark.

Adine was just an annoying, whiny little kid. Irene (even at the end with what she did) was just blergh and I hated her and how she did things. The parents are bleh. The sisters? I just kept being confused as to who was who. Then we had a cat, which also confused stuff.You can also clearly see the age of this book. Parents smoking near their kids? Near a baby? An aunt who just smokes brown cigarettes a lot and doesn't care if people are bothered? (Until of course there is a magical sign, then she apparently gets it.) Sure, there are parents who smoke nowadays too, but you mostly won't read about it in the book.The name thing? Poor baby, being called Baby for several months until someone finally decided on a name. The story? Well what story? There is not much story, and I was pretty bored at times.The one thing I did like was that they made a new mural/wall for each baby, with objects/stuff that started with the first letter of their name.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this one.Review first posted at http://twirlingbookprincess.com/"], ["This was my favorite story as a child. It was the first that really spoke to me internally. I will get this for my daughter or son when it comes to that time as well."], ["This review also appears on my blog, Read-at-Home Mom.Adine is the oldest of five sisters, all of whom have been named in alphabetical order. Her mother is expecting a new baby, and everyone just assumes it will be a girl. When their mother's labor begins a month early, the girls begin to prepare the nursery with an F-themed decor, according to family tradition, and all of the girls eagerly anticipate meeting their new little sister. When the baby turns out to be a boy, no one - including Adine's mom, who is deemed unable to have anymore children - knows quite how to react. In the meantime, Adine locks horns with her aunt Irene, who comes to help out the family, but whose husky body, obsession with cats, and pushy attitude embarrass Adine.Everything about this book is very 80s. The cover features children wearing hairstyles and clothing long forgotten, and the adults in the story smoke in front of the kids. Parents are not yet able to find out the sex of their unborn children during routine ultrasounds, and they photograph their children using Polaroid cameras.The kids play with Cabbage Patch Preemies and Fisher Price people and there are references to Willard Scott's regular appearances on the Today show. For adults, the nostalgia abounds, but kids are unlikely to feel the same sense of warmth toward these now-obscure references.As a story, it has much in common with sit-coms of the day. Aunt Irene is so outlandish, she is nearly a caricature. Her gruffness and her obsession with cats seem like such cliched characteristics to give to an unpleasant relative, and though she is redeemed and even appreciated by the end of the story, she still lacks the depth that Henkes gives to other characters in his later novels. But really, the thrill of reading this book comes from the knowledge that Henkes does go on to write much better stories. It is remarkable that the same man who writes such lyrical novels as Olive's Ocean and Junonia is also the author of this light sitcom of a novel. To note the evolution from this book to those is just so interesting.The Zebra Wall is a fun family story, and it is a lot like Ten Kids, No Pets and Eleven Kids, One Summer, two novels by Ann M. Martin which I read over and over again in childhood. Even the alphabetical names are common to both families. I don't think The Zebra Wall holds up too well for today's audiences, but anyone who can remember the late 80s should get a kick out of it."], ["I enjoyed book The Zebra Wall. I can relate to this book because Adine felt left out at some parts with her whole family and that is what happens with my family sometimes.

They have a mural wall but decide to change it all up when the new baby is gonna come.

They already have a pretty big family, the Volorbs have 5 girl daughter ages 0-10. Now they are bringing another child into the family. The Volorbs have a problem though, their Aunt Irene is staying with them until there mom gets better after the baby is born. The whole family likes Aunt Irene except Adine, the whole trip didn't go very smooth for Adone and we Aunt.

Ford"}, "A Literature Guide [To] The Phantom Tollbooth Written By Norton Juster; Illustrated By Jules Feiffer": {"average_rating": "0.00", "review": [["I just finished this book with my oldest boy. I've been reading a chapter or two out loud to him every night when we can manage it. I never read The Phantom Tollbooth before, so it had no particular nostalgic appeal to me. But I'd heard about it, and it was in my house (somehow) so I decided to give it a try. Here's the short version: Meh. It's not awful. But it wasn't great, either.Overall, I found reading it to be a bit of a slog. When thinking ahead to reading time at night, I want to be excited. It's special time with my boy. But instead when I thought about this book, I mostly wanted to get through with it I could start reading a different, more engaging, book together with my boy. Here's the long version: Irritations: 1. No plot or tension. I'm fairly sure the formal term for a book like this is a picaresque. It's mostly just a series of adventures and visits to interesting places. There's not much of a plot. And before you get all impressed that I know that term, I'd like to mention that I only learned it in 2010 by listening to an interview with Neil Gaiman where he was discussing American Gods. I remember thinking, \"Huh, apparently I've written a picaresque. I wish I'd known that about 10 years ago\u2026.\" Here's the thing, while plot isn't the focus of a picaresque, you can still tell an engaging story. There's plenty of tension in American Gods. There's a mystery and action and questions that need answering. \"What's up with Wednesday?\" \"What's going on with Shadow's wife?\" \"What's happening in this small Midwestern town?\" And there is the overarching story arc about the war between the new gods and the old gods. My point is, there's a lot of things going on in American Gods. Many things to make you curious. Many things to pull you into the story in addition to the interesting people and places that we meet through the course of the story. Phantom tollbooth doesn't have that. It's the story of a boy who goes places and stares around in amazement as things happen around him. He and his companions (for the most part) don't do anything. They're reactive, not active, and they're not particularly clever\u2026 Which leads to my next gripe\u2026 2. The characters aren't that interesting. If your main character's motivation is that he's bored\u2026 well\u2026 that's not really edge-of-the-seat material is it? Don't get me wrong. I don't need an apocalypse. I don't need something to blow up. But we need *something* to provide excitement in the story. The Laura Ingalls Wilder books were fucking gripping. There were snowstorms and locusts and fucking bears. Just getting water or going to town was an adventure in those books. Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a picaresque too, of a sort. Every different piece of the factory is like a separate land and adventure. But Charlie is *interesting.* And Wonka is doubly so. The grampa and all the other kids might be fairly simple characters, but they all have personalities. I just wasn't feeling the same way about the people in this book. Most of them were just some clothes loosely draped around rather thin jokes. 3. It's Chaffy. There's a lot of what I consider \"Junk Dialogue\" in this book. People talking without saying anything purposeful. People arguing about nothing in particular. People repeating themselves. And a *lot* more description than I was particularly interested in. I know it might seem hypocritical for someone who wrote a 400,000 word novel to bitch about another author's economy of phrase. But the truth is, I make sure every scene and sub-scene in my books accomplish at least three productive things, more if I can manage it. And let me tell you, when you're reading a book out loud, you can tell when it's full of pointless description and dialogue. When you're reading to yourself you can skim without hardly realizing it. Not so when you're reading aloud to a child. Enjoyments: 1. I got to experience Oot's first pun. I think it was witch/which. I got to see the light go on in his head when he understood the joke. That's worth a lot. (No. Wait. It was the Watchdog. He's a dog with a clock in his body.) He also enjoyed the fact that the Watchdog could fly a little because of the expression \"time flies.\" That said, he didn't get about 85% of the jokes in the book. They were just too abstract language-wise. 2. Some of the concepts were fun and clever. I'm willing to admit that Oot is simply too young for this book. There were jokes about multiplication in there. And jokes about turns of phrase that he didn't know. And puns about expressions he'd never heard. But I don't think it's entirely fair to blame it on his age. There was a demon in there called a Dilemma that chased people and tried to gore them on its horns. You could easily be in your twenties and not know the expression, \"on the horns of a Dilemma.\" 3. My boy liked it well enough. When I asked him, he said he liked it. What's more, he remember the events and the characters better than I did. That said, he never came up to me holding the book and said, \"Let's read some more!\" Like he did with Spiderwick, the Hobbit, or many others. So this probably counts as a pretty lukewarm endorsement from him as well. So\u2026 yeah. Didn't love it. Didn't hate it. The sum total probably comes down slightly on the irritated side of indifferent.My advice? This is a book that your kid probably needs to be 10 to really enjoy, as it's got a lot of wordplay in it. And honestly, 12 might be better.Even so, I can think of a lot of books that are much more enjoyable with a lot less effort."], ["JULYas part of my personal reading challenges for 2017, once a month i will be revisiting a favorite book from when i was a little bitty karen and seeing if it holds up to my fond memories and determining if i can still enjoy it as an old and crotchety karen.fingers crossed.so: first things first. in answer to the question 'does this book hold up?' here\u2019s what\u2019s weird. i have no memory of reading this book as a kid. i know i read it - i remember all of jules feiffer\u2019s illustrations and i have strong memories of taking it off the library shelves and adding it to my stack on a number of occasions, and i also remember it being read to me in elementary school in my AT program (that\u2019s \u2018academically talented,\u2019 thank you very much). however, reading it for this project, it was completely unfamiliar to me - i had no nostalgic shiver of recognition, nor any anticipation of what was to come. the only explanation i have for this blank is that while reading this book as a child, i also witnessed an unspeakable crime, after which i was kidnapped and had my memory wiped, accounting both for the lack of memory and the simultaneously strong memory of borrowing it from the library multiple times.which is fine - i have no interest in remembering unspeakable crimes, and the memory wipe allowed me to experience this book as though for the first time. baby-karen review:adult-review:adults-only this time, i guess. this book is beyond delightful - silly, yes but also genuinely funny and smart. full of puns and paradoxes and wordplay and wonderland-logic, but more sophisticated and less loopy than wonderland - it\u2019s a clever kind of humor that appeals to both kids and adults and also happens to be full of truths:\u2026you can swim all day in the Sea of Knowledge and still come out completely dry. Most people do.sure, there are lots of lessons, like the importance of choosing your words with precision, and the necessity of common sense and imagination in learning, as it contributes more lasting value than rote memorization, which is basically the point of this book - milo is a smart enough kid, but he is bored by school, because he has no framework for applying his learning:\u201dI can\u2019t see the point in learning to solve useless problems, or subtracting turnips from turnips, or knowing where Ethiopia is or how to spell February.\u201d but once he passes through the magical phantom tollbooth, he begins to actually apply his brain and creativity towards problem-solving adventures both linguistic and numerical, meeting many crazy characters along the way, taking some on as traveling companions, like the wonderful watchdog. who is a dog and a watch at once. like the watchdog, the lessons milo learns revolve around the ideas of what is possible - broadening his educational perspective, transcending the limited brainbox of formal education and embracing a less structured, more experiential approach to learning.\u201done of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are.\u201dthis is one of those revelations that can change a person, and juster reinforces it in a number of ways:\u201dso many things are possible just as long as you don\u2019t know they\u2019re impossible.\u201dwhich is a reasoning that brings to mind that alice in wonderland quote:Alice\u00a0laughed: \"There's no use trying,\" she said; \"one can't believe impossible things.\" \"I daresay you haven't had much practice,\" said the\u00a0Queen. \"When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\u201dbut it\u2019s a different treatment - in alice, the tone is just a giggle; it\u2019s silliness in a vacuum. juster\u2019s take is more encouraging and ultimately more useful as a life lesson, fostering self-confidence: \u201d\u2026you had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you will do.\u201dthat is not to say that this is a through-and-through feel-good book. some of the realizations are very sobering slaps:\u201dBut if all the roads arrive at the same place at the same time, then aren\u2019t they all the right way?\u201d asked Milo. \u201cCertainly not!\u201d he shouted, glaring from his most upset face. \u201cThey\u2019re all the wrong way. Just because you have a choice, it doesn\u2019t mean that any of them has to be right.\u201dthis is an amazing insight and i wish i DID remember this book from my childhood days, because lord knows it is a useful lesson and it\u2019s one that many adults haven\u2019t figured out. of course, we\u2019ve figured out some of the other lessons the hard way:\u201dYou\u2019ll find,\u201d he remarked gently, \u201cthat the only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that\u2019s hardly worth the effort.\u201dindeed.the last thing i want to call out is this illustration of the terrible trivium, which looks like nothing less than an early version of slender man:the terrible trivium is just as insidious as slender man - he doesn\u2019t make kids stab their friends, but as the demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort, and monster of habit, he definitely brings his share of struggle to us all with his outlook:\u201dIf you only do the easy and useless jobs, you\u2019ll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won\u2019t have the time. For there\u2019s always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing\u2026which is interesting to me, because i encountered a similar philosophy recently in Arbitrary Stupid Goal, and when i read it there, i applauded it:A goal that isn\u2019t too important makes you live in the moment, and still gives you a driving force. This driving force is a way to get around the fact that we will all die and there is no real point to life.But with the ASG there is a point. It is not such an important point that you postpone joy to achieve it. It is just a decoy point that keeps you bobbing along, allowing you to find ecstasy in the small things, the unexpected, and the everyday.What happens when you reach the stupid goal? Then what? You just find a new ASG.i recognized and appreciated this way of thinking, completely forgotting about juster\u2019s version of it until i sat down to write this review and noticed the parallel. which makes my theory about some sort of book-related memory wipe implanted by hypnotic suggestion in my formative years more or less fact. so, if you haven\u2019t read this one yet, or if you have had your own memory of having read it wiped, get on it. and if you have bred children, make them read it. and do not let them anywhere near unspeakable crimes. which should go without saying, but still.JANUARY: wait till helen comesFEBRUARY: the little gymnastMARCH: zucchiniAPRIL: something queer at the libraryMAY: good-bye pink pigJUNE: the girl with the silver eyes********************************************shark week was so much later this year than usual that it threw me off, so i'm reading this one just under the gun, and trying to finish two more shark books before the week of festivities ends.

In this charming children's book, author Norton Juster takes us on an adventure with his main character Milo, a young boy who enters a chaotic place called the Kingdom of Wisdom and finds that to restore order in the kingdom, he must save the banished princesses Rhyme and Reason.When the story begins, Milo gets home one afternoon expecting to go through the same humdrum after-school routine he always goes through. But on this particular day, he arrives home to find a tollbooth waiting to transport him to a faraway place. Soon, Milo is traveling through the Kingdom of Wisdom, seeking to rescue Rhyme and Reason with the help of his companions, Tock the Watchdog and the Humbug.Along the way, Milo meets some interesting and clever characters, such as the Whether Man (not to be confused with the Weather Man, \"for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be\") and Kakofonous Dischord, Doctor of Dissonance, whom Milo meets on the outskirts of the Valley of Sound. Page after page, Juster's clever puns and witty plays on words make his characters memorable and his storyline entertaining.On his journey, Milo travels to several places within the Kingdom of Wisdom, learning useful things along the way. In Dictionopolis, for instance, he discovers the abundance of words and the importance of choosing the right word for the right occasion. On his way to Digitopolis, a land ruled by numbers, Milo ends up on the Island of Conclusions. There, he decides to himself, \"From now on, I'm going to have a very good reason before I make up my mind about anything,\" and he learns that \"you can lose too much time jumping to Conclusions.\"Armed with the knowledge he has gathered on his journey through the Kingdom, Milo finally reaches the Mountains of Ignorance, where he and his faithful companions dodge and outwit various demons and ultimately save the princesses Rhyme and Reason. In the end, Milo is transported back to the present with a newfound curiosity about the world and a greater appreciation for learning.Juster's humor throughout the story is at times subtle, at times downright silly, but often clever and thought-provoking, making this book an enjoyable read for young and old alike. They say there's a child in all of us, and The Phantom Tollbooth truly is a children's book for all ages."], ["I am a reader, and I measure my life in books, and the ones that I read in my very early years were probably the most formative. You can learn a lot about a person by what their childhood was like- whether they played outside all the time or preferred to stay indoors, whether they read or didn't, whether they drew or played sports or learned instruments and languages.I, for one, loved words. I read many books with large words in them, and so I was always asking my mother what they meant, or looking them up in the dictionary, or trying to just guess. I loved long words, short words, words that were fun to say. I would spell them, write them down, sometimes just say them aloud in strings of total gibberish. Even as a child, I remember being amazed that I could make sounds with my mouth that other people could recognise and understand. The idea that I could say the word \"apple,\" which really is an odd word when you look at it long enough, and that somebody else would know exactly what I was referring to was thrilling.I used to play a word association game I made up where I would think of a word, then think of a word associated with that word, then a word associated with that word, and on and on until I either tried to get back to the word I started with or tried to see how far I could deviate from my original word. So a game might start with the word \"pencil\" and go from there to \"paper,\" \"bag,\" \"rag,\" \"towel,\" \"trowel,\" \"garden,\" \"green,\" \"leaf,\" \"tree,\" \"wood,\" \"paper.\" Or I might start with \"pencil\" and go to \"lead,\" \"bed,\" \"jumping,\" \"kangaroo,\" \"pouch,\" \"couch,\" \"sofa,\" \"soda,\" \"bubbles.\" This all took place in my brain, and sometimes I'd just sit in my room for hours and do this. (I would be lying if I said I didn't still do it occasionally.)I loved books, too. I loved the idea that somebody could put words down on paper and that I could create a world in my mind based off of those words. From a young age, I followed characters, tried to predict plots, and lived in that lovely world somewhere between reality and imagination that we call literature.All of this boils down to the fact that, to me, language was a playground. I'd make up words, speak backwards, sometimes go whole stretches of time just spelling out words instead of speaking, like \"H-E-L-L-O (space) M-O-M (comma) H-O-W (space) A-R-E (space) Y-O-U (space) D-O-I-N-G (question mark)?\" Punctuation, spelling, even fonts and typeface and foreign languages- everything related to words was something I was fond of.And it all started with The Phantom Tollbooth.Well, not exactly. I'd been doing a lot of this stuff even before I read the book, but The Phantom Tollbooth really helped to make these qualities stick with me.Why? Because I felt the way I do whenever I find a great book: that I'm not alone. Norton Juster, through wordplay and illustrations and wit, showed me that language, and, to an even greater extent, knowledge, was a wonderful thing. As I read this book and travelled among the Whether Man, Princess Rhyme and Princess Reason, the Mathemagician, and King Azaz the Unabridged, as I read riddles and jokes and equations and utter nonsense and wise advice and snatches of song, as I ventured with Milo and Tock into the Doldrums and the Lands Beyond, to Dictionopolis and Digitopolis and up over the Mountains of Ignorance, I recognised myself in all of these things, and each one of them told me that I wasn't weird for loving language and reading compulsively and making up words and collecting utterly useless facts. Or more accurately, they told me that I was weird- but that there aren't enough weird people in the world who commit themselves to these things, so it was okay.You can learn a lot about a person based on the books on their bookshelf: whether they're pristine or worn, whether they're organised or not, whether they've got notes written in the margins or flowers pressed between the covers or the signatures of authors. And if you were to look at my pitifully small bookshelf (the rest of my books reside in two enormous stacks by my bed), you would find a worn, torn, stained, and utterly beloved copy of The Phantom Tollbooth. And perhaps you would be able to tell, just by looking at it, that it taught me one of the most important lessons I've learned: that imagination is a beautiful thing, and even if you think that you're too old for things like word games and math equations and fun facts and puns and stories- things, in short, that bring you knowledge and delight, even if you think you've outgrown them... Deep down, they will never outgrow you."], ["The Phantom Tollbooth is--without doubt--the funnest book I've ever read. Not only did I love this book as a kid, but I love it even more the older I get.It has enough of a save-the-princess plot to hold your attention, a cast of Pixar-like zany characters, and it's set in a world so riddled with puns it's unbelievably fun.From the way the tollbooth mysteriously arrives, to the way it takes Milo to a strange new world, to the quest he ends up on to save the princesses Rhyme and Reason, to how he ultimately returns home--this story never stops surprising, never stops intriguing, and definitely--not for a word--does it stop being fun."], ["I wasn't as impressed with this book as many of my friends. Perhaps that is because of my high expectations for the book or perhaps because of my preferences in writing style. So those who love this book can use one of those two reasons to blow off my review. However, the fact remains that I was not very interested from page to page, and if not for a commitment to a book group, I am afraid I would not have had any desire to finish it.In style the book seems to be written for a particular age group ranging from 8-11, depending on the vocabulary and maturity of the reader. And, for the preteen sense of humor, the wordplay was appropriate and would be quite funny to the intended audience. However, the wordplay was really the only interesting aspect to the book, and I'm tempted to say as much for the joke books my niece reads to me. The plot was simple and was secondary to both the wordplay and the multiple morals of the story. In fact, a new moral was introduced with every chapter (some chapters containing more than one moral), and each chapter was only a few short pages long. This was the main drawback to the book. Not to say that morals aren't important in a work, but too many morals are detracting. Introducing, then immediately leaving a moral behind decreases the likeliness that it will be remembered once the book is finished. My other main problem with the book was the lack of description to help the reader enjoy the fantastical and quite creative world Juster introduces. Here one moment, and there the next, the reader is left wondering...How did Milo find his car again (he was lost only a moment ago)? Where are they? What do they see? This book, whose main moral is to teach a child to notice the world around them, simply forgot to take a look around. (The spectacular scene with Chroma and his orchestra being the exception.)Overall, an interesting book, leaps and bounds above the other children's literature of Juster's contemporaries, but not my favorite."], ["Reading \"grown-up\" literature is excavating the human soul, the adult soul: a mangled mess of contradictions and self-deceptions, screwy motives and the odd self-adherent logic of artistic creation. But Literature (capital ell) is a pyrrhic battle between message and evasion: one must avoid moralizing outright, must avoid overt allegory, but must never be too subtle, too veiled, lest you be resigned to snobby undergrabs and many rubbish bins. The Phantom Tollbooth is a strange beast: decidedly accessible to children, but remains lovable to adults. It's championing of the struggle against moral short-cuts, boredom, and mental waste is timeless, ageless, and remains prescient, even to me: a grown person 52 years after it's publication!My grandmother has always said: \"only boring people get bored\" - I am guilty of sometimes serving this packaged wit cold when a friend laments \"I'm bored!\" but I think forcefully throwing this book at them would be a better remedy. What is signifed in my grandmother's aphorism is that interested people are interesting, and more importantly are never idle. My family (paternal side) is a hard-working, conservative, New Englander family: we don't watch much television, we read lots of books, we listen to NPR and read the Wall Street Journal, we somewhat self-indulgently talk about the cultural decline in literacy and how we are not a part of it. But the story of Milo is one which is both entertaining, lovable, but also cautionary. By no means is Milo a bad child, a dull idler, but rather he has not found passion yet. He is bored because his urban living, his deadening routine has stayed access to the bliss of potentiality. \nThe only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that's hardly worth the effort.\nWe are plagued, as a modern, urban society by the two-headed monster of routine. Routine comforts us, it gives us an escape into the dull and Terrible Trivium: the small tasks which comfort us and distract us from important, difficult work and choices. Our society is filled with spineless and indecisive people (the Gelatinous Giant) and those who feed us half-truths, who coddle us into a mire, into a trap (Monster of Insincerity): they are not villains, and these flaws do not define all people, but are characteristic in turn. Our weaknesses, our daemons, are our horrible defenses, our cozy citadels in the mountains of Ignorance. It is not the absence of bad habits (hours of dull television, bad reading or no reading) that marks an individual's decline, but rather the presence, the support, of our defenses. The demons of the mountains of Ignorance are impotent without our compliance, they feed on our weakness for what is easy. If we allow the glittering sovereigns of Rhyme and Reason to go fugitive in their empyrean prison, we lose our grip on true happiness, we become boring, we become easily bored. Thankfully, there is nothing boring in The Phantom Tollbooth: its play with language is unrivaled certainly in children/young-adult literature, and rivals even the masters of play (Joyce, Nabokov, etc) in the grander schema. With a dual reverence for words and numbers, rhyme and reason, and a prevailing apotheosis of time, beyond the value of currency: something never to be wasted, Juster champions all forms of mental activity and cerebral play. I can imagine no better way to introduce a bored student, particularly one ahead of his class, to the ever-infinite vistas of imagination and invention than to hand him or her this book. \n\u201cIt has been a long trip,\" said Milo, climbing onto the couch where the princesses sat; \"but we would have been here much sooner if I hadn't made so many mistakes. I'm afraid it's all my fault.\"\"You must never feel badly about making mistakes,\" explained Reason quietly, \"as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons.\u201d"], ["\"RESULTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED, BUT IF NOT PERFECTLY SATISFIED, YOUR WASTED TIME WILL BE REFUNDED.\" That is the promise the boy Milo receives when he embarks on a hilarious adventure to rescue two princesses named Rhyme and Reason in a fantasy land beyond the Phantom Tollbooth, which he explores with a colourful bunch of characters. At the beginning of the story, Milo is a bored young man who does not care much for anything, and can't see any point in learning, discarding knowledge and understanding as quite useless. During his journey into increasingly absurd adventures, however, he slowly but steadily sharpens his mind and wit, and starts thinking for himself, reflecting on different perspectives of reality. The biggest midget in the world happens to be the smallest giant in the world at the same time, and Milo would not have thought of either title for the man who appears absolutely average to him. In Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, he learns about the peculiarities of language and maths, and about the complexity of thought that is the basis for our means of communication.In the end, when Milo has developed into a curious, mature boy who cherishes the adventure of learning, he receives a final lesson from all the crazy characters in the story:\u201cAs the cheering continued, Rhyme leaned forward and touched Milo gently on the shoulder. \"They're cheering for you,\" she said with a smile. \"But I could never have done it,\" he objected, \"without everyone else's help.\" \"That may be true,\" said Reason gravely, \"but you had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you *will* do.\" \"That's why,\" said Azaz, \"there was one very important thing about your quest that we couldn't discuss until you returned. \"I remember,\" said Milo eagerly. \"Tell me now.\" \"It was impossible,\" said the king, looking at the Mathemagician. \"Completely impossible,\" said the Mathemagician, looking at the king. \"Do you mean----\" said the bug, who suddenly felt a bit faint. \"Yes, indeed,\" they repeated together; \"but if we'd told you then, you might not have gone---and, as you've discovered, so many things are possible just as long as you don't know they're impossible.\" And for the remainder of the ride Milo didn't utter a sound.\u201dI read this book aloud to a Grade 7 a couple of years ago, and later, when they were in Grade 9, they told me it was still their favourite book, and one they would never have read through or understood without the joint effort of the class, as it is a story requiring a high level of language skills as well as general understanding of how to motivate learning and generate curiosity. Just like Milo in the story, some students might have given up in the middle if they had not shared and cheered each other on. It is not a simple mainstream, straightforward plot.One of the completely impossible tasks in the book was described by the author in an afterword. He had had a conflict with his illustrator who refused to draw a required situation in the book. He claimed it to be impossible. The drawing was supposed to show the following: \"Three demons, one tall and thin, the second short and fat, and the third exactly the same as the other two!\"My students and I gave ourselves the task to create the drawing, and there were as many different results as there were participants in the activity. But we solved it: \"I'm possible\", we wrote underneath. It is one of my favourite memories of reading with students, and I highly recommend the book to grown-ups and children alike: if you are not satisfied, after all, wasted time will be refunded!"]], "review_count": "0", "description": null, "author": "Barbara Moross"}, "Daniel Deronda Notebooks": {"average_rating": "3.50", "review": [["I watched a TV adaptation recently of Andrea Levy's Small Island, a book I had read when it first came out but which I'd more or less forgotten. The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "George Eliot's notebooks from the years 1872-77 reveal her acquisition of a wide range of learning about Judaism, and provide insight into the creative process of integrating that learning into her last novel, Daniel Deronda.

Adams admitted that he was having a \"bad year\" when he wrote this book, and it shows: the usual humor and manic pacing are largely gone, replaced by long tracts about actual theoretical science (as opposed to the lunatic-inspired science that created, say, the starship Bistromath), and the tone overall is far darker and more depressive. There are still glimpses of Adams' comedic genius, but the book as a whole is a definite cog or two down the scale from the first four.

I think it says a lot about the readership that they took in the entirety of the first four books without picking up on the melancholy and nihilistic subtext to Adams' writing. I mean, the first book ends with the discovery that the meaning of life is 42.... how much clearer does it need to be in order convey the ultimately meaningless adventure that Adams saw life in this universe to be? More importantly, at what point did that fact ever stop him from telling a spectacular story?It is the journey, more than the end, that defines us and the worlds we live in. I think Arthur's encounter with the man on the pole in Hawalius can be taken as a pre-emptive response to those who would invariably decry the novel to be \"too bleak\": humans seek to be protected from knowing the things we don't want to know about, and it leads us to miss a great deal of understanding, experience, and acceptance, sometimes with dire psychological consequences. A reader may not want to know how the story of Arthur and his companions ultimately ends, or how any story that goes on long enough must end, but it's a blind and willful ignorance that serves no purpose but to save us seeing reality, in all its complicated and multidimensional depth of cause and effect and pure probability.Personally, I found this book to be a brilliant and thought-provoking conclusion to a sharp, touching, and gloriously honest series. The ending of the novel, with Arthur at peace and Ford laughing wildly, is the most honest part yet. I pity any reader who doesn't get that."], ["Mostly Harmless is the closing chapter of Douglas Adams' series, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Unless, you want to count And Another Thing by Eoin Coffer as the last installment of the series, but by all extensive purposes I leave it at Mostly Harmless. I am unsure if I will follow the guide any further, since my American Express card was rejected through my elaborate travels.Mostly Harmless follows one Homo Sapien, Arthur Dent, on an exuberant, random, and slightly sad adventure through space, time, and multiple dimensions. Arthur is one of the last humans in the entire universe, and all he wants to do is return home to Earth, or a place like Earth, or somewhere he fits in. He would like a place where he could sit with a cup of tea, or walk to the pub. Unfortunately, Earth was destroyed to make an interstellar highway, which dragged Arthur on his biggest, unwanted adventure. The whole series is a roller coaster ride of random, hilarious (hence the random Ron Swanson bacon gif) events that Arthur cannot shake off. Will he ever have a nice, quiet, simple life, where he can makes sandwiches!? I have to say I enjoyed being in the back seat of Arthur's miserable, sulking life, while he and Ford Prefect get pummeled by rocks. Or when Arthur crashes onto another planet. Everyone knows he is stranded, but no one rescues him. Insurances companies are to blame. I cannot tell you if the series has any real point, besides Arthur trying to fit in somewhere. I guess, we all want to fit in somewhere. Then again, I didn't really care if the books had a point at all. All I wanted was to have my sides ripped apart, because I was laughing so hard. On one particular occasion, my daughter asked me why I was laughing. I explained the reason to her, but she didn't seem to understand the humor. I should of known she wouldn't laugh. What did I expect from an almost three-year-old, who laughs at being chased around the house!? I do not think I could find a funnier series. There are only a few times in life where I could laugh at a rocket being launched at a main character. Will I read this series again? I bet you two sandwiches of Perfectly Normal Beast, and my towel that I will. It was the best laugh I had in a long time. The whole series was my type of humor, and I cannot beat that. Next time, I will buy the books instead of Martin Freeman narrating for me. Martin Freeman did a fabulous job, even if he said squirrel a little awkwardly.

The story is focused on Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. Poor Arthur, who finally found happiness at the end of book four, has the love of his life whisked away from him senselessly and is back to wandering the galaxy alone. He finally settles down to a life that many would find mind-numbingly dull but that suits Arthur just fine. Just as he begins to grow accustomed to his new role in the universe, Trillian and then Ford show up to pull Arthur back into their chaotic adventures. Ford has discovered a plot that puts not just the Guide, but the universe itself at risk and, once again, a reluctant Arthur is pulled along for the ride. The book has two problems. The first is that it simply isn\u2019t as laugh-out-loud funny as the first three Hitchhiker books. Series staples like Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android are nowhere to be found, and Trillian plays a relatively minor (if complicated) role. I think that part of what makes the first two books so hysterical is the interplay between all of these larger than life characters (including Ford) and the bewildered Arthur. Like a sitcom with a great cast, it\u2019s at it\u2019s best when all the key players are together. The comedy slips a bit in book three when the characters begin to drift apart, and by the fourth entry some of the regulars are beginning to disappear entirely. But in book four, Adams shifts the story from intergalactic mayhem to a (relatively) conventional love story. Unexpectedly sweet, the fourth book is able to alleviate the pain of losing the Zaphods of the galaxy by telling a different kind of tale.But very little is sweet about this book, which brings us to problem number two. Mostly Harmless is kind of a downer. Adams was apparently going through some personal problems when he wrote this, and described it as \u201ca rather bleak book.\u201d He expressed interest in writing a sixth novel to finish the series on a more upbeat note, but died before he had the opportunity. We are left with a somewhat sad ending to a great series, particularly (view spoiler)[ the grim, fatalistic conclusion (hide spoiler)]. While I begrudgingly accept that comedy is subjective and not everybody\u2019s funnybone is tickled the same way, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine somebody not liking the first two books in this series (even though I know these readers exist). But this one\u2026let\u2019s just say I can see how a reader would find Mostly Harmless to be mostly bleh.That said, it\u2019s still Douglas Adams and I still liked the book. There are some really funny bits interspersed through all the melancholy: Colin the Android, Ford\u2019s heroic crusade against the Guide\u2019s expense accountants, and virtually every exchange between Ford and Arthur. It\u2019s not the same caliber as the first two books in the series, but if you enjoyed the third and fourth books you\u2019ll probably like this one. Readers who like happy endings may want to call it a day after book four, however. 3 stars."], ["The Encyclopedia Galactica, that venerable compendium, has a lot to say about the works of Douglas Adams. In particular, the first four books of his 'Hitchhiker's' series have over 7 million words dedicated to them. This includes synopses, critical analyses, research projects, philosophical treatises and Babel-fish fan-fiction. But the fifth book in the series has not enjoyed this level of attention. Until recently, the Galactica article regarding this novel comprised a single word; 'pointless.'A sub-set of literature fans didn't appreciate this and launched an extensive campaign to rectify the situation. They argued that Mostly Harmless wasn't a lazy cash-grab or evidence that Adams didn't give a crap by that point. Or at least that it was more than just those things.So while most agreed that Mostly Harmless paled in comparison to its predecessors, they felt that it was still funny and featured a distinctly sad perspective. They wrote impassioned essays about the book's themes regarding the search for purpose and the inevitability of fate. One particularly poignant contribution talked about how much of the novel felt like the beginning of a brand new adventure, a brand new series, and that made the sudden finality of the ending feel crushing. And after many years of protest and tasteless #harmlesslivesmatter jokes they convinced the Galactica to change the article. From thence on, the book on Mostly Harmless reads 'Mostly pointless.'"], ["Hitchhiker's, volume 5.There are some good lines in this, but I can't help feeling it would have been better if Adams had left it unwritten, or at least unpublished.

It took me a long time to read only because of lack of time, and a rather annoying trait the author has that I'll go into later.This is one of those books that tells us more about the period it was written in than anything else, so it's important to note that it was first published in 1961 and later again in 1968 - when moon fever was running high and people seemed to have high expectations for human achievement. Events are set in an undisclosed future but the older characters seem to remember the first moon landing, so I wouldn't be surprised if Heinlein was thinking of it being set around about now. With a mix of very daggy technology like \"stereo tanks\" (TVs) and large, clumsy listening devices, alongside hover crafts and spaceships to Mars, the scope of the setting is hampered by a 50s' imagination. Stranger in a Strange Land is about Michael \"Mike\" Smith, the \"Man from Mars\", offspring of two of scientists on board the original mission to Mars, who was raised by Martians. He is more Martian than human, especially in his thinking and outlook and philosophy, when he is brought back to Earth. Heir to a shitload of money care of his parents' heritage, it's unsurprising that the bigshots on Earth are wanting to keep him locked up tight. A nurse at the hospital where he is first kept, Jill, offers him a glass of water and in that one action becomes a \"water brother\" - the highest accolade for Mike. She rescues him from the politicians with the help of her journalist friend Ben and takes him to the home of a grumpy, reclusive man, Dr Jubal Harshaw, who lives with three young women who serve as secretaries - Anne, Miriam and Dorcas - and two men who take care of the property - Duke and Larry. Mike's particular talents slowly reveal: he can vanish things, including people, if he recognises there is a \"wrongness\" in them; he can withdraw from his own body and shut down his body so there is no heartbeat; he can teleport and think telepathically; he can absorb books in minutes and regulate his own body, making it muscular and mature at will; and so on. All of this can be done with understanding of the Martian language, which Jill starts to learn. He's completely ignorant of human ways, of human concepts - things like jealousy, possessiveness etc. are all alien to him. He doesn't understand religions and he has never laughed.After months on the road with just Jill, learning and \"grokking\", he finally knows why humans laugh and how to do it himself, and gets the human condition. It leads him to start his own \"church\", though it's more of a way of life open to people of all religious denominations, with free love and open mindedness, and abilities gained through mastery of the Martian language. With Mike set up as a new Messiah, a prophet, there's only one logical conclusion for this story.As a story, Stranger in a Strange Land is enjoyable and original. Yet, as a story, it's also bogged down with sermons, with Heinlein's opinions, and a very out-of-date mentality. It reads very 60s and 70s, though it was written before then. Not as far-sighted as it would like to be! It's especially noticeable in the relations between men and women, which have that faintly liberated tinge that's all really lip service, and a great deal of sexist language. Which is ironic, really, considering Mike's free love cult. There's also an affectionate insult for a Muslim character who's nicknamed \"Stinky\" that I couldn't help but be offended by.It does make it hard to read, though, when you come across lines like this, as spoken by Jill very matter-of-factly: \"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault.\" (p304) While today the statistics are more like \"nine of ten times, a woman's rapist is someone she knows\", the idea that it's \"partly her fault\" is still considered true by way too many people. To hear this come out of Jill's mouth makes it especially awful.Another example is Jubal saying: \"Pipe down, Anne. Close your mouth, Dorcas. This is not a time when women have the vote.\" (p382) Granted, they ignored him and did what they wanted anyway, but there're a lot of these flippant, dismissive remarks all through the book. Product of its times, sure: just not at all futuristic.Then we come to the proselytizing, which the book is rife with. Today, reading this book, the opinions shared are very \"yes, so?\" - old hat, in other words. Though it is fun to read the rants, the set-up is cringe-worthy. Jubal is the main lecturer, and the characters around him serve as props. There are a great many \"Huh?\"s from educated and knowledgeable people so that Jubal can share his abundant wisdom. One \"huh?\" is okay, but when each long paragraph of Jubal is responded to with a \"huh?\" it gets a bit silly. Frankly, it's bad writing. It reminded me somewhat of The Da Vinci Code, which also uses characters to expound the author's theories on religion etc. at great length. While these things did at times make it harder to read the book, essentially the book is easy to read and often quite fun too. Jubal's sermons (and when Jubal isn't around, other characters fill the role, like Ben and Sam) can be a bit heavy-handed and obvious but a lot of it I agree with, so it wasn't rubbing me up the wrong way. Mike is a challenging character to write, because in order to write a naive, ignorant character to this extent, you need to be incredibly self-aware. Heinlein has fairly good success here, and Mike's growth, maturation, development and resolutions fit the character and work. He has charisma and is definitely intriguing; yet because he lacks the human flaws, he's also somewhat unapproachable and alien: a good balance to achieve."], ["This is a book that it seems like I should like. It deals with issues of religion, including a strong critique of religion as we know it, presents socially progressive ideas about sex and relationships, and relies upon a fundamentally humanist, individualist philosophy. In the end, however, I can't get past a few things to really like this book. 1. The word \"grok.\" I understand the meaning and significance of the word within the book and I understand why Heinlein chose to create a new word to carry this meaning, but \"grok\"? It's an ugly word and it gets used about 150 times too many in the book.2. The use of mystic religious concepts and practices. Heinlein critiques traditional, human religions, but he is unable or unwilling, finally, to leave behind the trappings of religion, relying upon them to bolster his argument. This bothers me because it feels like manipulation, like a man trying to have it both ways by using the religiosity and losing the religion. Michael admits that his philosophy, his truth, \"couldn't be taught in schools\" and says, \"I was forced to smuggle it in as a religion--which it is not--and con the marks into tasting it by appealing to their curiosity\" (419). He admits that he is manipulating his audience (just as Heinlein manipulates his) as well as admitting that the people he is trying to save are no more than marks, dupes to be conned. This is entirely too cynical for my taste and does not accord with the whole \"Thou art God and I am God and all that groks is God\" philosophy.3. The sexism of the text, which is inseparable from its heteronormativity and even homophobia. Despite Heinlein's progressive (especially for the time) ideas about sexuality and desire, he reinforces the gender dichotomy repeatedly, putting women and homosexuals in their place as he does so. Sometimes this is obviously negative and hard to miss, especially for a modern reader: \"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault\" (304). At other times this is done with apparently positive statements: \"Male-femaleness is the greatest gift we have--romantic physical love may be unique to this planet\" (419). A statement like this one is troubling not because of its emphasis on romantic physical love but because of its insistence on the male-female gender dichotomy as a necessary component of that love. A more substantial example arises when Jill discovers that she likes to be looked at it, that it makes her feel desirable. She says, \"Okay, if a healthy woman liked to be looked at, then it follows as the night the day that healthy men should like to look, else there was just no darn sense to it! At which point, she finally understood, intellectually, Duke and his pictures\" (302-3). The realization that she likes to be looked at is fine as far as it goes, although the immediate leap from there to pornography is definitely a problem (pornography of course having huge and unavoidable issues of power wrapped up in it that this analysis neatly sidesteps). Following Jill's realization of her own desire to be looked at, Mike comes to see that \"Naughty pictures are a great goodness\" and they go together to strip clubs to enjoy the live version. However, \"Jill found that she 'grokked naughty pictures' only through a man's eyes. If Mike watched, she shared his mood, from sensuous pleasure to full rut--but if Mike's attention wandered, the model, dancer, or peeler was just another woman. She decided that this was fortunate; to have discovered in herself Lesbian tendencies would have been too much\" (307). Here, Heinlein brings together his progressive, free love ideas about sex itself with his more traditional ideas about gender roles and his leaning toward homophobia. The conclusion Jill arrives at here is that a) sex and desire are good, b) women are the spectacle, never the spectator, and c) lesbianism is completely taboo, even for someone who is otherwise interested in opening herself up to sexual love in its many forms. This one scene simply brings together these ideas that recur throughout the second half of the book. Repeatedly, it is made clear that homosexual behavior is a danger for Mike to avoid and that women's role in sexual behavior is essentially passive. 4. The emphasis on self, whether in self-love, self-pleasure, self-control. There are two basic ideas here. One is stated by Patricia Paiwonski, Mike's first convert, who says, \"God wants us to be Happy and He told us how: 'Love one another!' Love a snake if the poor thing needs love. Love thy neighbor . . . . And by 'love' He didn't mean namby-pamby old-maid love that's scared to look up from a hymn book for fear of seeing a temptation of the flesh. If God hated flesh, why did He make so much of it? . . . Love little babies that always need changing and love strong, smelly men so that there will be more babies to love--and in between go on loving because it's so good to love!\" (288). Love is wonderful, love is a good goal, but this is a love I am suspicious of, for it is a love based on feeling good, based on happiness. There's nothing wrong with feeling good and being happy, of course, but if feeling good and being happy are the primary goals of life, then that opens the door for abuses of others in the name of love or happiness and seems a rather meaningless goal in and of itself. Hedonism alone is not enough for me. The second basic idea is Mike's final message to the people: \"The Truth is simple but the Way of Man is hard. First you must learn to control your self. The rest follows. Blessed is he who knows himself and commands himself, for the world is his and love and happiness and peace walk with him wherever he goes\" (429). Again, this is not a bad goal--for once, finally, Mike brings a message of personal responsibility to add to the free love and grokking that has constituted most of the rest of the book. However, to expect the rest to follow from that kind of responsibility and self-control is just silly. This is The Secret, this is \"name-it-and-claim-it\" theology, this is bullshit. Like the idea that God wants us to be happy so if we all try to live for our own happiness, it will all work out, this is a philosophy that believes that YOU are the center of the universe, that everything will work out for the best. This is the complete opposite of the philosophy provided in Kurt Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan. Vonnegut also emphasizes love and finding a kind of happiness, but in his universe, those things are refuges in the midst of chaos, small things we can each do to make the world we live in a little better, a little more livable, not means to become masters of the universe. For Heinlein, God moves from out there to in here, validating each individual person's individual desire and decision; for Vonnegut, there is no God, not out there and not in here. For me, that is much more appealing."], ["One must read Heinlein's signature work to understand what all the fuss is about, from both sides. For the RAH fans and Sci-Fi crowd, this is an excellent book, a masterpiece of the genre. For the opponents, and I understand there are many, he systematically makes a lot of folks mad, from conservatives and theologians, to feminists, and even pro-government liberals. He was way ahead of his time, and yet also rooted in a pre-war mindset that was probably infuriating to young baby boomer readers and especially to the baby boomer\u2019s parents. But the influence on the genre and on the larger culture is unmistakable.And the next thing is that this really transcends the science fiction genre. Heinlein, excusing his later life meanderings into the weird and sexually uninhibited, was a great writer. He uses a Sci-Fi story about a man from Mars as a vehicle for him to explore and to expound upon a great many subjects, most notably theology, ideology, social and sexual mores, and popular culture. Love it or hate it, and this work will no doubt inspire strong emotion, this is a powerful book and a must read for SF fans."], ["(Note: Original pub date is 1961)Fuck you, Heinlein!!!

The misogyny. is. Unrelenting. It is so completely unrelenting that I kept wondering if the whole thing was a put-on.

It'e like they're supposed to be a different species or something. Either Heinlein is pulling the reader's leg, or he's a gender-specific sociopath.3) This is not really a separate point, but since there's like 100 pages (at least) devoted specifically to the beauty of orgies, up to and including lady-orgies, I'm shocked at the lengths Heinlein goes to in order to emphasize that none of the male characters are gay, or would ever consider being gay. Again, it's a dated book, or whatever? But the introduction clearly states how Heinlein was trying to break every taboo he could think of, up to and including cannibalism.Cannibalism. But no gay dudes. Even the Martian is like \"Of course, as I preach the power of sexual utopia, I could never ever, never ever, never ever hook up with a dude. But I could totally teach all the ladies to be better at hooking up with dudes. I could do this by having sex with all of them.\"HELL'S YEAH BRO! ALL YOU BRO!4) Jubal Harshaw. We need to talk about Jubal Harshaw. If you talk to anyone about this book, after you get through the rampant misogyny and the no-gay-dudes and the this-book-is-terrible, some asshole will go \"Yeah, but Jubal Harshaw, amirite?\" Like the idea that you have one character that sort of has a personality makes up for all the other characters having less than none. Let me frame it for you this way -- at the beginning of the book, Jubal Harshaw is a hack writer living in self-imposed exile surrounded by women who are basically all secretaries / mothers / daughters / girlfriends to him. By the end of the book, the Martian cult members all believe he is the father of their Martian Jesus, and then he gets laid by a young woman who's used her spooky Martian powers to transform herself into a clone of the one female character everyone in the book is in love with. So maybe that sounds like a cool spot to be in, right? Not to mention Harshaw is written as being the smartest person on the planet, negotiating with the media and the government in one swoop in order to protect the Martian Jesus -- not in a pure-holy-genius way, but a this-old-maverick-can-outthink-all-you-whippersnappers-and-corporate-shills kind of way. Like the pure doggone common sense of being a fat middle-aged fiction writer will get you a harem of mom-secretary-daughter-girlfriends, make you more powerful than the UN, and make you the father of Martian Jesus.Heinlein was a fat middle-aged fiction writer when he wrote this. SO IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR WISH-FULFILLMENT. IT'S HEINLEIN'S. AND THAT DUDE'S FREAKING DEAD.4)We need to talk about the Martian sex cult. First, I'm calling it this because it's totally what it is, even thought technically it's a bunch of humans living in sexual utopia through learning Martian mind tricks. But Martian sex cult is funnier and truer. As I said earlier, there's at least 100 pages devoted to an attempt to break down the reader's preconceived notions about sex cults not being creepy, and how they make everyone happier. But look, maybe Heinlein didn't have old episodes of \"Real Sex\" to watch on the internet, but now we do, okay? And sex cults are creepy, fireals. In fact, 100 pages talking about their non-creepiness does not make them less creepy. Guess what it makes them the exact total fucking opposite of.And I'm just saying, maybe if there'd been one little guy-orgy in all those pages, like to replace all the dudes talking about how they were having sex with each other's wives? I'm just saying that would be a start. But mostly no. Because even then? You have this psychotic group-think thing that is totally mind-wipingly terrible and makes me hate everyone alive for liking anything about this book.5) In reviewing this, I'm going through it in my mind and heart again, and you know? I fucking hate it. I fucking hate this book. I was never actually convinced that Heinlein wrote all this stupid contradictory gender-politics stuff or insane cult stuff in order to troll the reader, which would be the one way I could possibly excuse everything else. The book is ethically dishonest, Heinlein was a scumgoat, and Jubal Harshaw is a turd.But the cover? It's pretty cool."], ["\"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it\u2019s at least partly her own fault.\" The most quoted sentence from this book.He's right it is. A woman should shroud herself in black, even wear a veil over her eyes and for extra protection she should wear a big size of Doc Martin boots so it could be a man under the shroud (Michael Jackson used to do that) and always be accompanied when she goes out. Which should be rarely. Very rarely. When she is in the house (most of the time) she should have the view through windows obscured and a chain on the door. No man who is not related to her should enter. Not workmen, not the police, not her son's friends from school. No one. Then she won't be raped. If she doesn't do all of the above, and she she is raped it is obviously her fault. If she does do all of the above and she is raped, then she should examine her conscience and see if there was something else she could have done to protect herself and didn't. This sounds like Saudi Arabia right? Or Afghanistan or any of those countries. This is because I was reading how there are very few rapes in these countries. It wouldn't have anything to do with the harsher penalties that the courts often apply to the victim rather than the rapist would it? (view spoiler)[Rape in Saudi Arabia worth reading this in it's (short) entirety (hide spoiler)].I suppose if you hold the attitude of it must be her fault '9 times out of 10' her punishment is just and knowing that, she isn't going to complain. Is this the world Heinlen, a large number of British and Caribbean judges (I don't know about American ones so much) would like to see? I don't think so, but then they still blame women. \"She was drunk\", \"she wore a short skirt\", \"she was out alone at night\", or even simply, \"she was out\", \"she opened the door to a workman\", she, she, she... Normal men don't rape, they like the woman to enjoy sex too. Rape is a crime of assault and violence. Normal men who like the idea of hard, violent sex like women who enjoy that kink too. Rape is never, ever, ever the response to lust by a normal man. It would be best if a woman home-schooled her daughters so that they are never exposed to risk but since they will not be going out very much, probably education beyond reading, writing and using a computer is pointless as housework, cooking and childcare will be all she really needs and she can get that from the endless reality shows she will no doubt watch as there isn't anything else much to do. A lot of men in the world would like to see this, minus the computer use. A lot of men in the world actually enforce this on women. And they still have rape in those countries.The book was brilliant and I read it years before I had my consciousness raised (horrible phrase). Just glanced at it again today and was reading some reviews and this rant just bubbled up, as they do.5 stars for being a brilliant book. 1 star for attitude towards women, total misogyny. Average 3 stars."], ["Nowadays, most people seem to either love or hate Heinlein. Many read his children's books like Podkayne from Mars, Red Planet and The Rolling Stones, enjoyed the adventure and moved on to his adult stuff just to get more. The politics, sexism and lack of depth went over their young heads. To them, his books were just great adventure. And yes, for the era in which they were written, they were great adventure and less sexist than most SF at the time. My intro to the man was a little different: I was dallying at the library because I wanted just one more book (I was 12 I think). My mom was trying to get me to leave so she glanced at the paperback rack where I was standing, grabbed \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and said, \"If you want to know how weird your father is, read this book.\" How could I turn that down? I grabbed it and devoured it as soon as I got home.I loved it, the free love was eye-opening, and I announced when I was finished that I was bisexual. I've never turned back, although my mom was understandably disbelieving, never really even hearing me. (She was later shocked when I first dated another woman.)The book affected me profoundly but I am afraid to read it again because I'm sure I'll hate it. So I have a love/hate relationship with Heinlein. He was my second favorite author by the time I graduated from high school having read everything he wrote. By the time he died, I had wised up and realized what he was really about. Libertarian politics anger me. His twisted sexism, the kind where a woman tells a man he's smarter because he needs to believe he is and yet has very little power, makes me want to vomit. And I hate to think what kind of racist drivel I'd find.But if there was a book that actually changed my life, this is it. Yes, I was 12, and yes, I would have come out eventually and yes, I would probably strongly dislike the book now. But Stranger was my favorite book for a long time. For its place in my past, my enjoyment of it at the time I read it, and the effect it had on my life, I must give it five stars. Just don't ask me to defend it."], ["\u201cDemocracy\u2019s worst fault is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents\u2014a depressingly low level.\u201dNow, why does that resonate so hard? Great line even though it is not representative of Stranger in a Strange Land\u2019s major theme.Stranger in a Strange Land is Heinlein\u2019s, best known and most popular book. It is not his most controversial novel but seems that way because it is the most widely read one. His later books  Friday and  I Will Fear No Evil are, to my mind, much more controversial, but also verges on being unreadable. This is not the case with Stranger in a Strange Land, which is a hoot from beginning to end.Robert Heinlein did not want Stranger in a Strange Land to be labeled as science fiction because he wants readers to view the novel as a sociopolitical allegory exploring the origin of a new religion, social mores, sexual liberation and other challenging themes. It is very easy to find stacks of in-depth analyses of this book online, but when I first read it in the 80s I was unaware of the themes, subtexts etc. At the time I only read sci-fi for the escapism and this book did not disappoint.Looking at the basic plot it is not surprising that Stranger in a Strange Land is labeled as science fiction. The story concerns Valentine Michael Smith, known to the public as \u201cthe Man from Mars\u201d. Mike (as he generally referred to by the other characters) was born on Mars, his parents and the rest of the crew the colonization starship Envoy mysteriously died. 25 years later another expedition from Earth discovers Mike as the lone survivor, having been raised by Martians. Mike is brought back to Earth, he is soon taken into the care of bestselling author Jubal Harshaw. This is where he learns\u2014at superhuman speed\u2014the English language and the peculiarities of human culture. Once he \u201cgroks\u201d* humanity he sets out to found a new religion based on Martian philosophy, featuring learning the Martian language, developing telekinesis, polygamy, \u201cthou art God\u201d and various other alien practices. His \u201cChurch of All Worlds\u201d picks up many followers but is viewed with disdain by the authorities and followers of the established religions, who are out for his blood.Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimov are often referred to as the \u201cBig Three\u201d sci-fi authors. During my formative years as a sf reader, Heinlein was my favorite of the three, followed by Asimov then Clarke\u2020. He just seemed like the funniest, the most \u201cbadass\u201d. A couple of years ago I reread his  Starship Troopers, a book I enjoyed very much as a teenager, and found it to be overly didactic and consequently rather dull. Prior to this Stranger in a Strange Land reread I half expected to be similarly disappointed. This turns out not to be the case, the didacticism is there, but presented in a much more entertaining package. I particularly enjoyed the early parts of the book when Mike is depicted as a sort of space Mowgli. His sudden withdrawal into a corpse-like meditative state, his incomprehension of nudity, money, ownership and all social mores in general, makes for some great comedy. While the book is not exactly densely plotted I enjoyed his development from idiot child to a Crocodile Dundee-like character, and eventually to a messiah. Art by SharksDen The first half of the book reads more like a conventional sci-fi romp, the second half, which consists of more dialogue than plot, is where Heinlein throws his challenging ideas at the readers. From the several discussion forums I have read, quite a few readers decided to abandon the novel when the sexual issues come in thick and fast. As a more mature reader I could not help but notice the sexisms in the book, a lot of the bantering in the dialogue is fun, but the female characters are often talked down to by the men. The (non-graphic) depiction of free love is also cringe-inducing. As for the seemingly libertine ideas put forward by Mike, Jubal and several characters I would have to be crazy to agree with them all, but Heinlein\u2019s intent was never to convince the readers of these ideas but to provoke them to think, to try looking at \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d from new angles, even crazy ones.Heinlein\u2019s literary skills are ahead of most of his sci-fi contemporaries when he is not busy being sexist, his prose and dialogue fairly sparkle. Jubal Harshaw is probably the most vivid and vibrant character I have ever encountered in a sci-fi book; he obviously has all the best lines, probably because he acts as an avatar (self-insert) for the author. Valentine Michael Smith is almost as memorable because of his oddness. Unfortunately, none of the female characters are well developed or believable. For me, Stranger in a Strange Land is a flawed gem that sensitive female readers will probably find distasteful and feminists will find intolerable. I suspect Heinlein would have approved this state of affairs, as his intent for the book is to challenge the readers through satirizing the accepted social mores. If you can tune out the sexism (a product of its time) it is well worth reading; certainly required reading for anyone who wants to be \u201cwell read\u201d in science fiction.Notes:* \u201cGrok\u201d is the most famous neologism from this book. In essence it is a level of understanding so profound that the subject (or object) of this understanding becomes a part of you and vice versa.\u2020 The ranking is the reverse these days, I like Clarke best, then Asimov, then Heinlein. Lately, I have come to appreciate Clarke\u2019s epic hard sci-fi plot and speculations more than the other two biggies possibly because I read very few Clarke books in the 80s, at the time finding him too dry and not very humorous.\u2022 This review is of the \u201cuncut\u201d version as Heinlein first conceived and written it, first published in 1991. The abridged version was published in 1961, both versions have their fans (and detractors ). I read the 1961 version in the 80s, unfortunately I can\u2019t remember what the differences are; but I do think some of the dialogue in this uncut edition is rather longwinded. The 1962 Hugo Award was, of course, for the abridged version. Thanks, Denis for raising this issue.\u2022 Some of the background info for this review was gleaned from this Mental Floss article.\u2022 An interesting Goodreads group discussion about this book, which remains a problematical read for many, and Heinlein would not have wanted it any other way.\u2022 From Quora: Why are Heinlein, Clarke, and Asimov called the Big-Three of Science Fiction?Quotes:\u201cThe Universe was a damned silly place at best . . . but the least likely explanation for its existence was the no-explanation of random chance, the conceit that some abstract somethings \u201cjust happened\u201d to be some atoms that \u201cjust happened\u201d to get together in configurations which \u201cjust happened\u201d to look like consistent laws and then some of these configurations \u201cjust happened\u201d to possess self-awareness and that two such \u201cjust happened\u201d to be the Man from Mars and the other a bald-headed old coot with Jubal himself inside.\u201d\u201cWhen one is of my age, one is necessarily in a hurry about some things.

No.But he tells me a story, and while he is telling it, I don't put that book down.I don't read books to find authors who agree with me or match some political template.I read books for stories. And diversity in story tellers is good."], ["\u201cNine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it\u2019s at least partly her own fault.\u201d (511)\nPerhaps this is the single most quoted statement from this work, and also the statement by which Heinlein is critiqued and berated, the same statement by which this philosophically charged work is sullied by 1-star ratings. Whether by inadvertent straying into a faulty conception and erroneous application of intentional fallacy or the failure to recognize that Heinlein sought this work to stand as historicization of the prevailing attitudes at the time of writing juxtaposed with those of the future, as represented by the Man from Mars, the loss of substance predicated upon such mistakes are saddening. Most reviews needlessly nitpick this book by implacably quoting sexist remarks offered to us by a cantankerous Jubal, who symbolized the attitude of a bigoted past, but that is missing the big picture, and missing the very idea this book seeks to impart. That is the point, to present homophobic, sexist, resistant-to-change personas that stand for the past, because in the end, we see that Jubal, is opened up to a new philosophy, divested of all improprieties and finds himself realigning his beliefs, a belief which is open to change. By doing so, Heinlein, through Jubal and the Man from Mars, asks the reader, by extension, to reexamine beliefs and conventions. To disregard this by literally focusing on the sexism is to lose the quintessential aspect of the book. See beyond the literal. Challenge the conventions.

Heinlein"}, "Daniel Deronda: A Conversation": {"average_rating": "4.50", "review": [["I watched a TV adaptation recently of Andrea Levy's Small Island, a book I had read when it first came out but which I'd more or less forgotten. The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "0", "description": null, "author": "Henry James"}, "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress": {"average_rating": "4.17", "review": [["TANSTAAFL = There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.My three favorite books of all time are (in no order) Heart of Darkness, The Dispossessed, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. When I first read this years ago I loved it, I could not put it down. As Stranger in a Strange Land was a Robert A. Heinlein vehicle for theology, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress to ideology. And just as The Fountainhead is the better, though less epic, of the pair with Atlas Shrugged, so is Moon is a Harsh Mistress, the more focused and simple of the two, better than Stranger in a Strange Land. I liked the setting, the use of libertarian principles and of course the brilliant work of the Grandmaster himself.This is a virtuoso science fiction futuristic re-telling of the American Revolution. Told from the first person recollection of a computer technician (with thick Russian accent) and of the birth and progress of the Lunar independence.The Moon (Luna to it\u2019s residents \u2013 who call themselves Loonies) has been a penal colony for decades. It is the perfect prison, get outside the underground warrens and beyond the air locks and you\u2019re on the moon. Without a pressure suit, you\u2019re dead. There are very little rules and no real laws, so a hardscrabble anarchy has created a loose but tough and resilient populace who want freedom.Certainly this libertarian paradise could have become an anarchistic hell, but in Heinlein\u2019s hard loving hands, his creation is the Free State of Luna. This story tracks with the American Revolution with unfair and distant landowners, inept and uncaring provisional governors (the warden) and even a declaration of independence on the fourth of July. Students of revolutionary movements will also see an allegory for \u201cthrowing rocks\u201d as a statement about the earliest stages of discontent and reaction.First published in 1966, this was written at the zenith of his considerable powers and stands as a true classic of the genre. I just re-read this (one the very few books that I have read more than once) and may re-read it again \u2013 it\u2019s that good."], ["do you play games where you know the outcome of the game itself is without question... where any fun to be had is not so much in the winning - that's predetermined - but in figuring out how exactly you will win, what moves you will make, how you will overcome all those minor hurdles along the way? that's sometimes how i feel when playing chess with some folks. for me, it's not the most exciting thing in the world; it's a little eye-rolling. i think others may have more excitement when playing a game they know they'll win. my little nephews seem to have a really enjoyable time kicking my ass at their various new-fangled video games. personally i don't get it, but they seem to love illustrating how easy and exciting it is, the thrill of watching all their strategies and skills coming to predictable fruition. even when there is no real competition. their eventual win is obvious. and that's the impression that i'm left with after reading the enjoyable Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.the novel is about a revolution on Luna by its oppressed permanent labor force. far in the future, the moon is the newest Prison Island... once you are transported there, you can't come back. and there you work, mainly to export grain, and live a life of economic exploitation by The Lunar Authority. you will alway live in this proletariat society. overall, it is actually not a horrible existence. the \"Loonies\" are an enjoyable lot, unpretentious and down to earth, concerned mainly with beer, gambling, and the ladies. Heinlein creates an odd and i suppose semi-utopic world, with a pleasing lack of laws (a kind of libertarian anarchy of sorts) and a surprisingly liberated view on women. basically, women are the social/family/romantic Boss of It All... not truly a matriarchal society per se, but rather one built around the need to make sure women are completely empowered. apparently due to the 2-to-1 status of men to women on the moon, and the need for women to be 'available' to much more than monogamy, if they so chose.still, despite the basic lack of horror in this odd world... it's no fun to be exploited by bureaucratic overseers. and so must come REVOLUTION! we have our friendly & no-nonsense Everyman, we have our bewitching & passionate Lady in Hiding, we have our amusing & highly intellectual Idealistic Professor. and of course we have our sentient computer Mike, who likes to play games. and revolution is just another kind of game, right?the writing is breezy, casual, and in a sort of pidgen english - a kind of cross between baby talk and our very own text messaging style. that style should be annoying but actually isn't. much like with HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, we have a fascinating computer who provides all of the genuinely emotional and resonant moments in the narrative. and - perhaps because of the time period in which the novel was written, but certainly topical today - we have a step-by-step account of How To Make A Revolution Work. Heinlein's passions come across mainly in the world-building of this almost-utopia and in the very detailed expression of how exactly to overthrow the chains of oppression through revolution (and i suppose a bit of terrorism, at times).so back to my original point. i liked this novel, but i would never consider reading it a second time. it was fun. but the outcome was never in question. Heinlein loads the dice by making sure that everything happens as projected, each step of the way. no tension... and a tension-free revolution is a curiously child-like enterprise. child-like but not childish. there is a sweet na\u00efvet\u00e9 to it all. Heinlein jerry-built this revolution to be won and so i never felt any kind of nervousness, i never worried. the only stakes that were meaningful to me were the (rather slight) emotional stakes around Mike the computer: his past loneliness, his concern about whether he is actually sentient, and his need to have friends, to talk to people who are 'not-stupid'. aww... that's adorable! Mike, i'm not super-smart or anything, but i'll be your friend! cute little revolutionary computer minds are very appealing to me."], ["Ah, Heinlein: SF's great paradox artist. I am fairly certain that I have personally held every possible wrong viewpoint on the man. Namely, that he was:1) A radically forward-thinking visionary of libertarianism2) A raging fascist, homophobe, and misogynist3) Any point on the sociopolitical spectrum in between.It's not my fault. Over the course of his career, Heinlein seemed to espouse every possible viewpoint on religion, government, and gender relations (obviously, he liked to stick to small themes), showing little tolerance for moderate opinions. Without a blink of irony, he also placed a premium on pragmatism. And the balance of pragmatism and idealism -- or, rather, the illusion that the two can coexist effortlessly -- is what The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is all about. It is the story of a lunar colony's revolt, in the same way that The Fountainhead is a book about architects (an insulting comparison; Heinlein's prose is significantly more readable than Ayn Rand's). You see, it's really about libertarianism -- or, as one of the book's heroes characterizes it, \"rational anarchism.\"So, a small group of revolutionaries attempts to liberate the moon from her Earthbound oppressors, and institute a perfect anarcho-syndicalist commune in their stead. They set about doing this, of course, with the help of a sentient supercomputer. They organize the people of Luna, and succeed in overthrowing the existing government, but in so doing upset the nations of Earth. After all, the moon has been shipping grain down to help feed Earth's starving masses, so they're a little cranky when the \"Lunies\" threaten to cut off the supply (you'd be cranky living on 1,800 calories a day too). Coincidentally, the ruling philosophy on Luna is the maxim \"TANSTAAFL\" -- There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch. I mentioned that Heinlein was subtle, right?So they go to war, and then, in the novel's single biggest twist, the computer doesn't turn evil. I could hardly believe it.Although the book is riddled with bizarre moments that nag one's attempts to suspend disbelief (the most persistent being Mike the Computer's regular updates as to the revolutionaries' \"probability of success,\" which starts out at 1/7, and then -- as everything proceeds to go perfectly to plan -- drops to as low as 1/100, in unapologetic defiance of all mathematical logic), the plot's weaknesses don't matter. Heinlein is a gifted novelist, and a natural storyteller. Even when the characters decide to take 10 pages off and simply talk politics for a while, it's enthralling. And talk politics they do. No one flinches at the notion of attempting to institute a perfect democracy run entirely by a handful of exceptional individuals, who themselves defer to the managerial expertise of a supercomputer (no tyrannic potential there, right?). Nor do they worry themselves with the philosophical contradiction of attempting to forge a pacifistic state by means of terrorism and interplanetary warfare (those who raise the issue, and thus violate Heinlein's worship at the Altar of Pragmatism, are conveniently Roslined out of the nearest airlock; it's okay, they're wormy enough that you won't miss 'em). But all of this simply serves to illustrate Heinlein's mastery of the ideological paradox. He's more than smart enough to recognize the inconsistencies of his own personal politics, and to play with them to terrific effect. Notably, Heinlein did not self-dentify with the majority of his protagonists. Instead, his Mary Sues are characters like Stranger in a Strange Land's Jubal Harshaw and, in the case of The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Professor Bernardo de la Harshaw--er, Paz. They are cynical old men who are, in novel after novel, infallible, brilliant, well-connected, and almost disturbingly capable.Exit thought: why is it that the computer that makes the revolution possible just happens to share its name with the superhuman hero of Stranger In a Strange Land, both of whom disappear suddenly and inexplicably upon concluding their tasks?"], ["One of the presents for my mother this Christmas was an Amazon Echo (Alexa). Having recently reread Robert Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, I couldn't stop thinking about the parallels between the awakened computer, Mycroft (Mike) in this novel and Alexa. This connection was reinforced when people kept asking Alexa to tell a joke. While he helps the former convict Lunar settlers in a rebellion against Earth, MIke's obsession remains fixated on jokes (and whether they are funny only once, in a given situation or always funny). Maybe Alexa is not on the verge of becoming self-aware; however, the idea that artificial intelligence could awaken is explored in an interesting way by Heinlein (in 1967) without the knowledge of what AI looks like now. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress feels a little clunky in my reread, but this side plot (Mike awakening) works well with the main plot (overthrowing Earth's control of the Moon). I would also have liked more on the implications of Mike's awakening, but overall Heinlein tells an interesting and enjoyable story about the not so distant future."], ["What do you want us to do? Throw rocks at them?Nah, but we could have a tea party.Wow. I'm still amazed at how good this Revolution novel has held up over the years. I had read it twice before this latest re-read, but it hasn't lost any of its charm.Of course, I love Heinlein's heavy reliance on self-reliance, libertarianism, and TANSTAAFL. I'm lucky to have read him early so as to be fully indoctrinated in this gung-ho politicism of Rational Anarchy and I can laugh and whoop and grin foolishly all the while.But I'm weird.Still. When it comes to the story, the most amazing thing about this novel is not that it's set on the moon or that it has been populated with all of Earth's undesirables, or that they're economic slaves to the Earth. Nope. It's amazing that this book is actually a How-To-Guide on how to stage a successful revolution against a technologically and militarily superior foe, from initial planning, leverage, sleeper cells, and of course, political preparation, communication, diplomacy, and economics. And, of course, the resulting MASS DEATH of so many innocents. Can't forget that.But I suppose the one thing that sticks in my mind most strongly is the planetary computer, Mycroft. What a guy/gal. He/she always gets me in the feels. That's leverage.Fortunately or unfortunately, I keep on seeing tons of good revolution books or modern SF still stealing from this classic, either knowingly or unknowingly. Perhaps all AIs that show up in SF are a reply to Mycroft in one way or another. Who knows? This is the one that stands out supreme in my mind and perhaps always shall.Call me a Lunatic. I dare you. ;)This one won the Hugo in '66, but I also place it firmly in one of my top 100 novels of all time. :) Great stuff. :)"], ["Very disappointing: 2.5* (it's not terrible, but it's weaker than books I award 3*, and I enjoyed it far less).I know of Heinlein as a sci-fi author and had heard of some interesting language-type things that make this novel unique, principally a Lunar dialect. Although it's mostly set in a lunar prison colony, just over 100 years after it was written (and 60 ahead of now), it's more of a political story, and the Lunar dialect is just a slightly stilted pidgin whose most notable features are the omission of articles and pronouns, and the odd Russian-influenced word.GOOD START, BIG IDEASIt starts off promisingly, immediately introducing big issues around artificial intelligence. Mike (short for Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother) is a supercomputer who enjoys jokes and playing pranks, which is an entertaining concept, but does he also have self-awareness, free will, emotions, personality and so on? The other principal character is Manuel (aka Mannie and Man), who is Mike's chief programmer and engineer. Oh, and a stupidly named woman, Why Not (albeit spelt Wyoming Knott, but usually abbreviated to Wyoh).Then it threw in issues of prison, punishment, freedom, civilisation, redemption, and some of the practicalities of living on the moon (low gravity, habitats, air, economics). Oh, and different types of marriage necessitated by a society with a huge gender imbalance: polyandry, clan marriage and line marriage (though the details and differences were not clearly explained). In this community, the scarcity of women gives them more power in relationships, which is a nice idea, but the opposite of what seems to be the case in China, decades after their one-child policy was introduced, with reports of young women being abducted and forced into marriage.Most of the humans living in tunnels on Luna are free: either the descendants of deported criminals, or they have served their time. In either case, they are too acclimated to return to the high gravity of Terra. There is no need for actual prisons, or even laws, because there is nowhere to escape to. The main industries are ice mining, and hydroponic farming; for the latter, they import fertilizer from Terra and then export the grain. But why go to the expense of all the transport to and from Luna, when they could do the same in tunnels on Terra?POLITICS, COLONIALISM and MORE POLITICSUnderstandably, some of the Loonies (as they call themselves) want independence from the exploitation of The Authority and its Warden, sent from Terra.Cue LOTS of socio-political... stuff. It's not a long book, so I ploughed on, assuming it would return to form, but it didn't. Instead, I read endless discussions of political theory and tactics (it's all about the cell system and money laundering), meetings and diplomatic missions, and eventually (view spoiler)[ war (hide spoiler)]. There are plenty of parallels with GB and Australia, but nothing startlingly original.One thing Heinlein did get right was the fundamental importance of communications, including mobile and covert - and also social media (not that he called it that, but irreverent propaganda was used to undermine the Authority and create unrest). However, everything seemed too easy. Mike was such a super supercomputer, and he had no competition. I kept waiting for something dramatic and unexpected to happen, but Mike was TOO omniscient and omnipotent for dramatic tension.ENDINGA few final paragraphs tried to bring it full circle, by contemplating computer consciousness and emotions, but it felt forced and rushed."], ["This is an excellent novel, action-packed, exciting, and deftly-plotted, with fascinating, complex characters and some interesting science-fictional ideas. I also enjoyed reading about Luna's culture; I thought the marriage customs were particularly interesting.One thing I noticed right off was the way the Loonies use language differently than people from earth do. In fact, it threw me at first -- I couldn't figure out what was going on or why the language was so rough and unpolished and choppy. Eventually, though, I found the rhythm of it and settled in just fine -- I didn't even notice it after a while. It makes sense; Luna started off as a penal colony and has since developed completely separate from Earth and relatively unmolested. Of course they would have their own dialect and speech patterns! To my mind, their language seems to be as efficient as possible. They trimmed away any unnecessary deadwood -- they don't use articles, for example, and very few personal pronouns, and they seem to prefer to use fragments to complete sentences. Only the essentials remain, much the same as the original colonists/prisoners had to start their lives over with only the bare essentials and sometimes not even that.This book was written about forty years ago, and it has stood the test of time quite well, but there are some aspects of it that do seem rather dated. For example, the idea behind the character of Mike -- the computer that is connected to everything and has \"woken up\" or become alive -- is one that is very familiar to modern readers, one that we accept easily. Apparently, we accept it much more easily than Heinlen expected his readers in 1965 to accept it, because he spends more time explaining it than he really needs to. When Mannie, the narrator, tells Wyoh about Mike and introduces them via a telephone conversation, she is shocked that Mike already knows what she looks like. He looked up her medical records and found a picture of her immediately after being introduced to her. To modern readers familiar with the internet, this is an obvious step and hardly shocking; we expect it, and Wyoh's shock and apparent need to have every detail and implication of Mike's \"life\" spelled out for her makes her seem a little bit stupid to us. If we don't remember that Heinlen is using Wyoh to explain things to his 1965 audience that his 2005 audience intuitively understands, then we'll get a little frustrated with Wyoh's denseness.All in all, though, this is a novel about politics -- a very complex, deep, intellectual and sophisticated look at politics, government, revolution and war. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress has a very definite world-view and political philosophy, some of which I agreed with, and some of which I really, really didn't. My agreement (or lack thereof) with the politics espoused in this book didn't seem to have much bearing on my enjoyment of it. This is a book that requires the reader to think. And that, I think, is why I loved it so much."], ["\u0130thaki bilimkurgu klasiklerinin 10. kitab\u0131 Y\u0131ld\u0131z Gemisi Askerleri'ydi, 20. kitab\u0131 da Ay Zalim bir Sevgilidir oldu, acaba 30. kitapta Yaban Diyardaki Yabanc\u0131 m\u0131 olacak diye d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnmeden edemedim.Y\u0131ld\u0131z gemisi askerleri ile militarizm ile ba\u015flayan sava\u015f\u0131 sorgulama bu kitapla birlikte daha farkl\u0131 yanlardan bir sorgulamaya gidiyor.Hapishane olarak kullan\u0131lan Ay'\u0131n Terra otoritesine kar\u015f\u0131 ger\u00e7ekle\u015ftirmeye \u00e7al\u0131\u015ft\u0131\u011f\u0131 devrim konu al\u0131n\u0131yor ancak kurgudan \u00e7ok devri nas\u0131l yap\u0131l\u0131r k\u0131lavuzuydu. ayn\u0131 zamanda kad\u0131n-erkek ili\u015fkileri, evlilik ve bo\u015fanmadan toplumsal kurallar ve cezalara kadar pek \u00e7ok farkl\u0131 alanda deneysel d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnceler ortaya koyuyor.Ben bireysel olarak bilimkurgu roman\u0131nda kullan\u0131lan \u00f6gelerin bilimsel dayanaklar\u0131n\u0131n (kurguya m\u00fcdahale edilmeden) a\u00e7\u0131klanmas\u0131n\u0131 talep ederim.

It's interesting!), and I've heard that they often used to chat about AI, science-fiction, and the connections between them. Here's a conversation I imagine them having some time between 1961, when Stranger in a Strange Land was published, and 1966, when The Moon is a Harsh Mistress appeared:\"Bob, this book's not so bad, but I felt it could have been so much better! OK, love the idea of the guy from Mars, who doesn't understand how people work and has to learn the most basic things about emotions, society, etc from first principles. You have some good stuff there. But I think you got a bit distracted with the super-powers and the sex. Sure, put in sex, all for it, but don't get Mike so involved in that part of the book. He should be more abstract I think. And I wasn't so thrilled by the fact that he never actually does anything much with his powers, except for start a minor cult and get martyred. Seems a bit negative. What does his martyrdom achieve, exactly?Wait. I have an idea. Why don't you rewrite it so that he's an artificial intelligence? Really, that makes more sense. He's even more alien than a human raised by Martians. Oh, don't worry about that, I can help you with the technical details. Feel free to drop in at the AI Lab any time, we're all huge fans. People will be delighted. So, yes, as I was saying, he needs to do something. Maybe he's... the central computer in a future Lunar society? And he helps them start a revolution, and break free from Earth's tyranny? Even though what he's really most interested in is understanding how humor works? I don't think you need to change that much else. Call him Mike again by all means, so that people see the link. And you should absolutely martyr him at the end. Only, I think this time you should do it in a subtler and more ambiguous way. But sure, leave the door open about whether he's really dead.\"\"Hey, thanks Marvin! Terrific ideas! You know, sometimes I think you should be the science-fiction writer, and I should be the AI researcher. I'll definitely come by soon. With a draft, I feel inspired. Going to start as soon as I put the phone down. Take care!\""], ["My first taste of Heinlein was Stranger in a Strange Land a few years back. It was, in a word, bad. So I gave up on Heinlein all together, figuring if his most famous and critically acclaimed book was no good, what chance did the others have? This conviction was met with protests from Heinlein fans, saying I need to read some \"good\" Heinlein before making the call. So I did, though it took me an unusually long time to finish. I just couldn't get into it. The characters were two-dimensional and shared too many qualities with those in SiaSL: the brilliant innocent (here, a self-aware computer named Mike), the levelheaded and elderly teacher/father-figure (Prof the anarchist philosopher), and the beautiful, \"smart\" woman whose most highly praised attribute is her ability to keep her mouth shut when the men are talking about important things (Wyoh, a revolutionary with a thing for older men - another SiaSL staple). Another recycled idea (though I don't know which book came first) was the group/line marriages, where the women are said to be in charge but actually spend most of their time at home worrying about their men. These characters weren't that great the first time around; the second time was just tedious.The idea behind the story is fine: the moon is more or less a penal colony under totalitarian rule. With the help of Mike the computer, Mannie (a computer tech who talks - and narrates the story - in an obnoxious dialect that sounds like someone faking a Russian accent very poorly), Prof, and Wyoh engineer a revolution. There is some interesting discussion of political ideals and governmental structure, but without sympathetic characters to bring it to life the story is about as gripping as your average high school civics class. I simply could not bring myself to care one way or the other. Now I wonder, how many more of his books do I need to read before I can officially say I don't like Heinlein?"]], "review_count": "396", "description": "Robert A. Heinlein was the most influential science fiction writer of his era, an influence so large that, as Samuel R. Delany notes, \"modern critics attempting to wrestle with that influence find themselves dealing with an object rather like the sky or an ocean.\" He won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, a record that still stands. <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> was the last of these Hugo-winning novels, and it is widely considered his finest work.<br /><br />It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of the former Lunar penal colony against the Lunar Authority that controls it from Earth. It is the tale of the disparate people - a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic - who become the rebel movement's leaders. And it is the story of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to this inner circle, and who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.<br /><br /><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is one of the high points of modern science fiction, a novel bursting with politics, humanity, passion, innovative technical speculation, and a firm belief in the pursuit of human freedom.<br /><br /><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is the winner of the 1967 Hugo Award for Best Novel.<br /><br />", "author": "Robert A.

And everybody had, like, the same two names. And there was this guy who lived under a tree and a lady who ate dirt and some other guy who just made little gold fishes all the time. And sometimes it rained and sometimes it didn\u2019t, and\u2026 and there were fire ants everywhere, and some girl got carried off into the sky by her laundry\u2026Wow. That was messed up.I need some coffee.The was roughly how I felt after reading this book. This is really the only time I\u2019ve ever read a book and thought, \u201cYou know, this book would be awesome if I were stoned.\u201d And I don\u2019t even know if being stoned works on books that way.Gabriel Garcia Marquez (which is such a fun name to say) is one of those Writers You Should Read. You know the type \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that everyone claims to have read, but no one really has. The ones you put in your online dating profile so that people will think you\u2019re smarter than you really are. You get some kind of intellectual bonus points or something, the kind of highbrow cachet that you just don\u2019t get from reading someone like Stephen King or Clive Barker.Marquez was one of the first writers to use \u201cmagical realism,\u201d a style of fantasy wherein the fantastic and the unbelievable are treated as everyday occurrences. While I\u2019m sure it contributed to the modern genre of urban fantasy \u2013 which also mixes the fantastic with the real \u2013 magical realism doesn\u2019t really go out of its way to point out the weirdness and the bizarrity. These things just happen. A girl floats off into the sky, a man lives far longer than he should, and these things are mentioned in passing as though they were perfectly normal.In this case, Colonel Aureliano Buendia has seventeen illegitimate sons, all named Aureliano, by seventeen different women, and they all come to his house on the same day. Remedios the Beauty is a girl so beautiful that men just waste away in front of her, but she doesn\u2019t even notice. The twins Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo may have, in fact, switched identities when they were children, but no one knows for sure \u2013 not even them. In the small town of Macondo, weird things happen all the time, and nobody really notices. Or if they do notice that, for example, the town\u2019s patriarch has been living for the last twenty years tied to a chestnut tree, nobody thinks anything is at all unusual about it.This, of course, is a great example of Dream Logic \u2013 the weird seems normal to a dreamer, and you have no reason to question anything that\u2019s happening around you. Or if you do notice that something is wrong, but no one else seems to be worried about it, then you try to pretend like coming to work dressed only in a pair of spangly stripper briefs and a cowboy hat is perfectly normal.Another element of dreaminess that pervades this book is that there\u2019s really no story here, at least not in the way that we have come to expect. Reading this book is kind of like a really weird game of The Sims - it\u2019s about a family that keeps getting bigger and bigger, and something happens to everybody. So, the narrator moves around from one character to another, giving them their moment for a little while, and then it moves on to someone else, very smoothly and without much fanfare. There\u2019s very little dialogue, so the story can shift very easily, and it often does.Each character has their story to tell, but you\u2019re not allowed to linger for very long on any one of them before Garcia shows you what\u2019s happening to someone else. The result is one long, continuous narrative about this large and ultimately doomed family, wherein the Buendia family itself is the main character, and the actual family members are secondary to that.It was certainly an interesting reading experience, but it took a while to get through. I actually kept falling asleep as I read it, which is unusual for me. But perhaps that\u2019s what Garcia would have wanted to happen. By reading his book, I slipped off into that non-world of dreams and illusions, where the fantastic is commonplace and ice is something your father takes you to discover.------\u201c[Arcadio] imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, declared to be public property any animals walking the streets after six in the evening, and made men who were overage wear red armbands. He sequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house under pain of execution and prohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells unless it was for a Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad organized in the square and had it shoot a scarecrow. At first no one took him seriously.\u201d"], ["I guarantee that 95% of you will hate this book, and at least 70% of you will hate it enough to not finish it, but I loved it. Guess I was just in the mood for it. Here's how it breaks down:AMAZING THINGS: I can literally feel new wrinkles spreading across the surface of my brain when I read this guy. He's so wicked smart that there's no chance he's completely sane. His adjectives and descriptions are 100% PERFECT, and yet entirely nonsensical. After reading three chapters, it starts making sense... and that's when you realize you're probably crazy, too. And you are. We all are.The magical realism style of the book is DELICIOUS. Sure, it's an epic tragedy following a long line of familial insanity, but that doesn't stop the people from eating dirt, coming back from the dead, spreading a plague of contagious insomnia, or enjoying a nice thunderstorm of yellow flowers. It's all presented in such a natural light that you think, \"Of course. Of course he grows aquatic plants in his false teeth. Now why wouldn't he?\"This guy is the epitome of unique. Give me a single sentence, ANY SENTENCE the man has ever written, and I will recognize it. Nobody writes like him. (Also, his sentences average about 1,438 words each, so pretty much it's either him or Faulkner)REASONS WHY MOST OF YOU WILL HATE THIS BOOK: I have to engage every ounce of my mental ability just to understand what the *@ is going on! Most people who read for relaxation and entertainment will want to send Marquez hate mail. Also, there are approximately 20 main characters and about 4 names that they all share. I realize that's probably realistic in Hispanic cultures of the era, but SERIOUSLY, by the time you get to the sixth character named Aureliano, you'll have to draw yourself a diagram. Not even the classic Russians suffer from as much name-confusion as this guy.On an uber-disturbing note, Marquez has once again (as he did in Love in the Time of Cholera) written a grown man having sex with a girl as young as 9... which is pretty much #1 on my list of \"Things That Make You Go EWW!!!\" He makes Lolita look like Polyanna on the virtue chart! (Note to authors: You give ONE of your characters a unique, but disgusting characteristic and it's good writing. Give it to more than one, and we start thinking we're reading your psychological profile, ya creep!)If you feel like pushing your brain to its max, read it. The man did win the Nobel after all, it's amazing. But get ready to work harder to understand something than you ever have before in your life. And may God be with you.FAVORITE QUOTES: (coincidentally also the shortest ones in the book)She had the rare virtue of never existing completely except at the opportune moment.He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians.Children inherit their parents' madness.He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and swum out the windows.He was unable to bear in his soul the crushing weight of so much past.It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.A person doesn't die when he should but when he can."], ["So I know that I'm supposed to like this book because it is a classic and by the same author who wrote Love in the Time of Cholera. Unfortunately, I just think it is unbelievably boring with a jagged plot that seems interminable. Sure, the language is interesting and the first line is the stuff of University English courses. Sometimes I think books get tagged with the \"classic\" label because some academics read them and didn't understand and so they hailed these books as genius. These same academics then make a sport of looking down their noses at readers who don't like these books for the very same reasons. (If this all sounds too specific, yes I had this conversation with a professor of mine).I know that other people love this book and more power to them, I've tried to read it all the way through three different times and never made it past 250 pages before I get so bored keeping up with all the births, deaths, magical events and mythical legends. I'll put it this way, I don't like this book for the same reason that I never took up smoking. If I have to force myself to like it, what's the point. When I start coughing and hacking on the first cigarette, that is my body telling me this isn't good for me and I should quit right there. When I start nodding off on the second page of One Hundred Years of Solitude that is my mind trying to tell me I should find a better way to pass my time."], ["More like A Hundred Years of Torture. I read this partly in a misguided attempt to expand my literary horizons and partly because my uncle was a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Then again, he also used to re-read Ulysses for fun, which just goes to show that you should never take book advice from someone whose IQ is more than 30 points higher than your own.I have patience for a lot of excesses, like verbiage and chocolate, but not for 5000 pages featuring three generations of people with the same names. I finally tore out the family tree at the beginning of the book and used it as a bookmark! To be fair, the book isn\u2019t actually 5000 pages, but also to be fair, the endlessly interwoven stories of bizarre exploits and fantastical phenomena make it seem like it is. The whole time I read it I thought, \u201cThis must be what it\u2019s like to be stoned.\u201d Well, actually most of the time I was just trying to keep the characters straight. The rest of the time I was wondering if I was the victim of odorless paint fumes. However, I think I was simply the victim of Marquez\u2019s brand of magical realism, which I can take in short stories but find a bit much to swallow in a long novel. Again, to be fair, this novel is lauded and loved by many, and I can sort of see why. A shimmering panoramic of a village\u2019s history would appeal to those who enjoy tragicomedy laced heavily with fantasy.

trapped in some kind of superbubble thing and it hit me that, being cartoons, the characters could just be erased and re-drawn outside the bubble. or could just fly away. or tunnel their way out. or teleport. or do whatever, really, they wanted... afterall they were line and color in a world of line and color. now this applies to any work of fiction -- i mean, Cervantes could've just written Don Quixote out of any perilous situation, but it just felt different with a lowest-common-denominator cartoon. it felt that adherence to reality (reality as defined within the world of the cartoon) wasn\u2019t a top priority. this ended my cartoon watching days and i\u2019ve pored over it in the years that followed: was it a severe lack or an overabundence of imagination that made it so that while all my friends were digging saturday morning cartoons i alternated between tormenting my parents and attempting to use logic to disprove the fact that everyone i knew and everyone i ever would know was gonna die?i had a similar experience with One Hundred Years of Solitude. the first chapter is just brilliant: gypsies bring items to Macondo, a village hidden away from mass civilization by miles of swamp and mountains\u2026 these everyday items (magnets, ice, etc.) are interpreted as \u2018magic\u2019 by people who have never seen them and it forces the reader to reconfigure his/her perception of much of what s/he formerly found ordinary. amazing. and then the gypsies bring a magic carpet. a real one. one that works. and there is no distinction b/t magnets and the magic carpet. this, i guess, is magical realism. and i had a Thundercats moment. lemme explain:the magic carpet immediately renders all that preceded it as irrelevant. are ice and magnets the same as magic carpets? what is the relation between magic and science? how can i trust and believe in a character who takes such pains to understand ice and magnets and who, using the most primitive scientific means, works day and night to discover that the earth is round -- but then will just accept that carpets can fly? or that people can instantaneously increase their body weight sevenfold by pure will? or that human blood can twist and turn through streets to find a specific person? fuck the characters, how can i trust the writer if the world is totally undefined? if people can refuse to die (and it\u2019s not explained who or how or why): where are the stakes? if someone can make themselves weigh 1000 pounds, what can\u2019t they do? how can i care about any situation if Garcia Marquez can simply make the persons involved sprout wings and fly away? should the book be read as fairy-tale? as myth? as allegory? no. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be read solely as any of those. and i\u2019d label anyone a fraud who tried to explain away a 500 page book as mere allegory. moreover, i don\u2019t believe Garcia Marquez has as fertile an imagination as Borges or Cervantes or Mutis \u2013- three chaps who, perhaps, could pull something like this off on storytelling power alone; but three chaps who, though they may dabble in this stuff, clearly define the world their characters inhabit. so i\u2019m at page 200. and i\u2019m gonna try and push on. but it\u2019s tough. do i care when someone dies when death isn\u2019t permanent? and do i care about characters who have seen death reversed but don\u2019t freak the fuck out (which is inconsistent with what does make them freak the fuck out) and who also continue to cry when someone dies? yes, there are some gems along the way, but i think had Solitude been structured as a large collection of interconnected short stories (kinda like a magical realism Winesberg, Ohio) it would've worked much better. this is one of the most beloved books of all time and i\u2019m not so arrogant (damn close) to discount the word of all these people (although I do have gothboy, DFJ, and Borges on my side -- a strong argument for or against anything), and not so blind to see the joy this brings to so many people\u2026 i fully understand it's a powerful piece of work. but i really don\u2019t get it. and i aggressively recommend The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll to any and all who find Solitude to be the end all and be all."], ["\"What is your favourite book, mum?\" How many times have my children asked me that, growing up with a mother who spends most of her time reading - to them, alone, for work, for pleasure - or looking for new books in bookstores wherever we happen to be.\"I can't answer that, there are so many books I love, and in different ways!\"\"Just name one that comes to mind!\"And I said, without really knowing why, and without thinking:\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude!\"\"Why?\"\"Because...\"This novel taught me that chaos and order are two sides of the same medal - called family life. It taught me that sadness and love go hand in hand, and that life is easy and complicated at the same time. It taught me that many wishes actually come true, but never in the way we expect, and most often with a catch. It taught me that sun and rain follow each other, even though we might have to wait for four years, eleven months and two days for rain to stop falling sometimes. It taught me that there are as many recipes for love as there are lovers in the world, and that human beings are lazy and energetic, good and bad, young and old, ugly and beautiful, honest and dishonest, happy and sad, all at the same time, - together and lonely.It taught me that we are forever longing for what we do not have, until we get what we long for. Then we start longing for what we lost when our dreams came true.This novel opened up the world of absurdities to me, and dragged me in like no other. In each member of the Buend\u00eda family, I recognise some relation, or myself, or both. Macondo is the world in miniature, and wherever I go, it follows me like a shadow. It is not rich, peaceful, or beautiful. It is just Macondo. No more, no less.My favourite book? I don't know. There are so many. But I don't think any other could claim to be more loved than this one."], ["One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a tremendous piece of literature. It's not an easy read. You're not going to turn its pages like you would the latest John Grisham novel, or The DaVinci Code. You have to read each page, soaking up every word, immersing yourself in the imagery. Mr. Marquez says that he tells the story as his grandmother used to tell stories to him: with a brick face. That's useful to remember while reading, because that is certainly the tone the book takes. If you can get through the first 50 pages, you will enjoy it. But those 50 are a doozy. It's hard to keep track of the characters, at times (mainly because they are all named Jose Arcadio or Aureliano), but a family tree at the beginning of my edition was helpful. The book follows the Buendia family, from the founding of fictional Macondo to a fitting and fulfilling conclusion. The family goes through wars, marriages, many births and deaths, as well as several technological advances and invasions by gypsies and banana companies (trust me, the banana company is important). You begin to realize, as matriarch Ursula does, that as time passes, time does not really pass for this family, but turns in a circle. And as the circle closes on Macondo and the Buendias, you realize that Mr. Marquez has taken you on a remarkable journey in his literature.

Nick Webb has caught the mood and mannerism of Douglas Adams to perfection, and anyone who's read Hitchhiker's or any of his other books will recognize the whimsical and charming humor inside this one.Wish You Were Here toes the line between what is personal and what is too personal to tell in a biography, but never once does the author cross it and there's never an uncomfortable moment when you think he's overshared a bit. All the stories he tells, and the natural criticism any imperfect human will be subjected to when their lives are being retold, are treated with the utmost respect and affection for the people in them. All I can say about this book is: read it. If you are familiar with Douglas Adams it will be like befriending him all over again with all his faults and virtues; if you don't know Douglas Adams read it anyway. This is the perfect example of how to write a biography that is truly in the spirit of its subject.Douglas Adams did not like biographies. But I believe that if Douglas Adams had to write an autobiography, it would be exactly like Wish You Were Here."], ["This isn't just a must-read for Adams fans, it's also a must-read for writers or any other creative type who enjoys the sweet torture of procrastination - Adams was a master of the genre.I'm not much of a biographies person but this one is almost like hanging out with Adams, he's that well captured."], ["Douglas Adams is one of my favorite writers, and I've been a fan of his books since I was about 12 or 13. Ironically, I was introduced to his first book (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) by my older brother, who has no sense of humor whatsoever.I read this at the same time as reading another Douglas Adams biography, called \"Hitchhiker\", written by M.J. Simpson. The reason I did this is I wanted to get a more complete sense of the life of my favorite humorist from more than just one viewpoint. Sure, each book is filled with interviews, but different writers focus on different things, and there was bound to be some stories and events that, while glossed over in one book, would be more fully described in the other. And I indeed found this to be the case. This book did a better job of telling the story of Mr. Adams' life from the viewpoints of his family and close friends. You get a sense of intimacy and closeness that is missing from the other book, largely because author Nick Webb was a close friend of Mr. Adams and family, and he had many personal stories to tell.I recommend this highly to anyone who has enjoyed or been influenced by the works of Douglas Adams. It is a worthy tribute to his life."], ["2.5ish. Full confession: I was one of those school kid nerds who discovered Adams' work and completely fell in love with it. I picked this up on impulse at the library and, sadly, struggled to get through it. There were lots of great stories about Adams (the author was a friend of his) but there were. So. Many. Names. I think if I had been familiar with 70s-80s famous media Brits I would have enjoyed it more. As it was, I kept stumbling and pausing, \"Should I know who this is?\" Still love Adams' work and admire his talents despite his quirks. He sounds like a great chap to have a pint with."], ["A bit rambly but enjoyable.Personally I find it extremely heartening that one of the funniest, most capable writers of the last few decades was beset by crippling self-doubt as to his abilities or chance of success in the world. Add to that the fact that are plenty of people who just as vastly overestimate their talents, and it just goes to show you never know.The biography is quite tolerable until the omg-he's-the-greatest quality of it gets to you. It's not like the level of admiration increases over time, or is particularly worth complaining about in the first place (not to mention that it's entirely understandable in the first place since the author was a friend of his) but it's like eating moderately spicy food until it builds up in your mouth and you just can't take any more spiciness."], ["Another thrift store find... and a fantastic one at that! Douglas Adams was a difficult genius and Nick Webb did a wonderful job of telling the story in a very even-handed manner. He admits Adams's shortcomings as well as some of his unpublicized triumphs. Webb's writing is also great. A biography has never been so fun! He has a quirky humor, much like Adams, that makes it an enjoyable read. The only bummer is that the book was published before the movie was released - I would have loved to hear his thoughts on the movie, and the thoughts of all the other creative minds behind Hitchhiker's to see how they felt about it. (I personally love the movie)"], ["This was a very comprehensive book, and very entertaining to read. It made me like Douglas Adams all the more, and really makes me want to go back and reread everything he's written! It took me an unusually long time to read for some reason (not a quick read), but I enjoyed every minute of it."], ["I thoroughly enjoyed this biography, and I may have to go back and reread Adams' books now."], ["Douglas Adams, and his ideas, were so much more than just Hitchhiker's."], ["I'm not a huge fan of biographies in general. Douglas Adams is one of my favorite authors, and I certainly learned a lot about him while reading this, but I can't say that it added much to my appreciation of his novels, or of him as a person. The author is British and the book was written over 10 years ago, so there was quite a wide cultural gap for me to leap as an American in 2017. References to British celebrities/actors/writers (from the 70s and 80s, mostly) abound that probably would have been more interesting if I had more familiarity.Much time is spent going into great detail about the companies and personalities behind Douglas' various projects (the original radio series, each novel, the non-fiction book, the video game and doomed Dot Com company), which was a bit of a slog.The most interesting parts were the insight into his crippling writer's block throughout his career. I know I can agonize over simply editing and rewriting a GoodReads review, so it's comforting to know that even one of my favorite authors struggled too.It was fun enough to read and definitely inspired me to finally go back and explore his catalog for a second time. That said, I'd only recommend this bio for the die-hard fans who want as much minutiae as they can get their hands on."]], "review_count": "45", "description": "It all started when Douglas Adams demolished planet Earth in order to make way for an intergalactic expressway\u2013and then invited everyone to thumb a ride on a comical cosmic road trip with the likes of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and the other daft denizens of deep space immortalized in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.<br /><br />Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book \u201ctrilogy\u201d that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you\u2019ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you\u2019ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique.

Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic<i>;</i> and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.<br /><br />A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat\u2013while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. <br /><br />By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration\u2013 a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject\u2019s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust.

Oh. Oh, man. Wow.I just had the  weirdest dream.There was this little town, right? And everybody had, like, the same two names. And there was this guy who lived under a tree and a lady who ate dirt and some other guy who just made little gold fishes all the time. And sometimes it rained and sometimes it didn\u2019t, and\u2026 and there were fire ants everywhere, and some girl got carried off into the sky by her laundry\u2026Wow. That was messed up.I need some coffee.The was roughly how I felt after reading this book. This is really the only time I\u2019ve ever read a book and thought, \u201cYou know, this book would be awesome if I were stoned.\u201d And I don\u2019t even know if being stoned works on books that way.Gabriel Garcia Marquez (which is such a fun name to say) is one of those Writers You Should Read. You know the type \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that everyone claims to have read, but no one really has. The ones you put in your online dating profile so that people will think you\u2019re smarter than you really are. You get some kind of intellectual bonus points or something, the kind of highbrow cachet that you just don\u2019t get from reading someone like Stephen King or Clive Barker.Marquez was one of the first writers to use \u201cmagical realism,\u201d a style of fantasy wherein the fantastic and the unbelievable are treated as everyday occurrences. While I\u2019m sure it contributed to the modern genre of urban fantasy \u2013 which also mixes the fantastic with the real \u2013 magical realism doesn\u2019t really go out of its way to point out the weirdness and the bizarrity. These things just happen. A girl floats off into the sky, a man lives far longer than he should, and these things are mentioned in passing as though they were perfectly normal.In this case, Colonel Aureliano Buendia has seventeen illegitimate sons, all named Aureliano, by seventeen different women, and they all come to his house on the same day. Remedios the Beauty is a girl so beautiful that men just waste away in front of her, but she doesn\u2019t even notice. The twins Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo may have, in fact, switched identities when they were children, but no one knows for sure \u2013 not even them. In the small town of Macondo, weird things happen all the time, and nobody really notices. Or if they do notice that, for example, the town\u2019s patriarch has been living for the last twenty years tied to a chestnut tree, nobody thinks anything is at all unusual about it.This, of course, is a great example of Dream Logic \u2013 the weird seems normal to a dreamer, and you have no reason to question anything that\u2019s happening around you. Or if you do notice that something is wrong, but no one else seems to be worried about it, then you try to pretend like coming to work dressed only in a pair of spangly stripper briefs and a cowboy hat is perfectly normal.Another element of dreaminess that pervades this book is that there\u2019s really no story here, at least not in the way that we have come to expect. Reading this book is kind of like a really weird game of The Sims - it\u2019s about a family that keeps getting bigger and bigger, and something happens to everybody. So, the narrator moves around from one character to another, giving them their moment for a little while, and then it moves on to someone else, very smoothly and without much fanfare. There\u2019s very little dialogue, so the story can shift very easily, and it often does.Each character has their story to tell, but you\u2019re not allowed to linger for very long on any one of them before Garcia shows you what\u2019s happening to someone else. The result is one long, continuous narrative about this large and ultimately doomed family, wherein the Buendia family itself is the main character, and the actual family members are secondary to that.It was certainly an interesting reading experience, but it took a while to get through. I actually kept falling asleep as I read it, which is unusual for me. But perhaps that\u2019s what Garcia would have wanted to happen. By reading his book, I slipped off into that non-world of dreams and illusions, where the fantastic is commonplace and ice is something your father takes you to discover.------\u201c[Arcadio] imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, declared to be public property any animals walking the streets after six in the evening, and made men who were overage wear red armbands. He sequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house under pain of execution and prohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells unless it was for a Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad organized in the square and had it shoot a scarecrow. At first no one took him seriously.\u201d"], ["I guarantee that 95% of you will hate this book, and at least 70% of you will hate it enough to not finish it, but I loved it. Guess I was just in the mood for it. Here's how it breaks down:AMAZING THINGS: I can literally feel new wrinkles spreading across the surface of my brain when I read this guy. He's so wicked smart that there's no chance he's completely sane. His adjectives and descriptions are 100% PERFECT, and yet entirely nonsensical. After reading three chapters, it starts making sense... and that's when you realize you're probably crazy, too. And you are. We all are.The magical realism style of the book is DELICIOUS. Sure, it's an epic tragedy following a long line of familial insanity, but that doesn't stop the people from eating dirt, coming back from the dead, spreading a plague of contagious insomnia, or enjoying a nice thunderstorm of yellow flowers. It's all presented in such a natural light that you think, \"Of course. Of course he grows aquatic plants in his false teeth. Now why wouldn't he?\"This guy is the epitome of unique. Give me a single sentence, ANY SENTENCE the man has ever written, and I will recognize it. Nobody writes like him. (Also, his sentences average about 1,438 words each, so pretty much it's either him or Faulkner)REASONS WHY MOST OF YOU WILL HATE THIS BOOK: I have to engage every ounce of my mental ability just to understand what the *@ is going on! Most people who read for relaxation and entertainment will want to send Marquez hate mail. Also, there are approximately 20 main characters and about 4 names that they all share. I realize that's probably realistic in Hispanic cultures of the era, but SERIOUSLY, by the time you get to the sixth character named Aureliano, you'll have to draw yourself a diagram. Not even the classic Russians suffer from as much name-confusion as this guy.On an uber-disturbing note, Marquez has once again (as he did in Love in the Time of Cholera) written a grown man having sex with a girl as young as 9... which is pretty much #1 on my list of \"Things That Make You Go EWW!!!\" He makes Lolita look like Polyanna on the virtue chart! (Note to authors: You give ONE of your characters a unique, but disgusting characteristic and it's good writing. Give it to more than one, and we start thinking we're reading your psychological profile, ya creep!)If you feel like pushing your brain to its max, read it. The man did win the Nobel after all, it's amazing. But get ready to work harder to understand something than you ever have before in your life. And may God be with you.FAVORITE QUOTES: (coincidentally also the shortest ones in the book)She had the rare virtue of never existing completely except at the opportune moment.He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians.Children inherit their parents' madness.He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and swum out the windows.He was unable to bear in his soul the crushing weight of so much past.It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.A person doesn't die when he should but when he can."], ["So I know that I'm supposed to like this book because it is a classic and by the same author who wrote Love in the Time of Cholera. Unfortunately, I just think it is unbelievably boring with a jagged plot that seems interminable. Sure, the language is interesting and the first line is the stuff of University English courses. Sometimes I think books get tagged with the \"classic\" label because some academics read them and didn't understand and so they hailed these books as genius. These same academics then make a sport of looking down their noses at readers who don't like these books for the very same reasons. (If this all sounds too specific, yes I had this conversation with a professor of mine).I know that other people love this book and more power to them, I've tried to read it all the way through three different times and never made it past 250 pages before I get so bored keeping up with all the births, deaths, magical events and mythical legends. I'll put it this way, I don't like this book for the same reason that I never took up smoking. If I have to force myself to like it, what's the point. When I start coughing and hacking on the first cigarette, that is my body telling me this isn't good for me and I should quit right there. When I start nodding off on the second page of One Hundred Years of Solitude that is my mind trying to tell me I should find a better way to pass my time."], ["More like A Hundred Years of Torture. I read this partly in a misguided attempt to expand my literary horizons and partly because my uncle was a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Then again, he also used to re-read Ulysses for fun, which just goes to show that you should never take book advice from someone whose IQ is more than 30 points higher than your own.I have patience for a lot of excesses, like verbiage and chocolate, but not for 5000 pages featuring three generations of people with the same names. I finally tore out the family tree at the beginning of the book and used it as a bookmark! To be fair, the book isn\u2019t actually 5000 pages, but also to be fair, the endlessly interwoven stories of bizarre exploits and fantastical phenomena make it seem like it is. The whole time I read it I thought, \u201cThis must be what it\u2019s like to be stoned.\u201d Well, actually most of the time I was just trying to keep the characters straight. The rest of the time I was wondering if I was the victim of odorless paint fumes. However, I think I was simply the victim of Marquez\u2019s brand of magical realism, which I can take in short stories but find a bit much to swallow in a long novel. Again, to be fair, this novel is lauded and loved by many, and I can sort of see why. A shimmering panoramic of a village\u2019s history would appeal to those who enjoy tragicomedy laced heavily with fantasy. It\u2019s just way too heavily laced for me."], ["\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0643\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631\u0647\u061f- \u062a\u0646\u0647\u062f\u062a

trapped in some kind of superbubble thing and it hit me that, being cartoons, the characters could just be erased and re-drawn outside the bubble. or could just fly away. or tunnel their way out. or teleport. or do whatever, really, they wanted... afterall they were line and color in a world of line and color. now this applies to any work of fiction -- i mean, Cervantes could've just written Don Quixote out of any perilous situation, but it just felt different with a lowest-common-denominator cartoon. it felt that adherence to reality (reality as defined within the world of the cartoon) wasn\u2019t a top priority. this ended my cartoon watching days and i\u2019ve pored over it in the years that followed: was it a severe lack or an overabundence of imagination that made it so that while all my friends were digging saturday morning cartoons i alternated between tormenting my parents and attempting to use logic to disprove the fact that everyone i knew and everyone i ever would know was gonna die?i had a similar experience with One Hundred Years of Solitude. the first chapter is just brilliant: gypsies bring items to Macondo, a village hidden away from mass civilization by miles of swamp and mountains\u2026 these everyday items (magnets, ice, etc.) are interpreted as \u2018magic\u2019 by people who have never seen them and it forces the reader to reconfigure his/her perception of much of what s/he formerly found ordinary. amazing. and then the gypsies bring a magic carpet. a real one. one that works. and there is no distinction b/t magnets and the magic carpet. this, i guess, is magical realism. and i had a Thundercats moment. lemme explain:the magic carpet immediately renders all that preceded it as irrelevant. are ice and magnets the same as magic carpets? what is the relation between magic and science? how can i trust and believe in a character who takes such pains to understand ice and magnets and who, using the most primitive scientific means, works day and night to discover that the earth is round -- but then will just accept that carpets can fly? or that people can instantaneously increase their body weight sevenfold by pure will? or that human blood can twist and turn through streets to find a specific person? fuck the characters, how can i trust the writer if the world is totally undefined? if people can refuse to die (and it\u2019s not explained who or how or why): where are the stakes? if someone can make themselves weigh 1000 pounds, what can\u2019t they do? how can i care about any situation if Garcia Marquez can simply make the persons involved sprout wings and fly away? should the book be read as fairy-tale? as myth? as allegory? no. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be read solely as any of those. and i\u2019d label anyone a fraud who tried to explain away a 500 page book as mere allegory. moreover, i don\u2019t believe Garcia Marquez has as fertile an imagination as Borges or Cervantes or Mutis \u2013- three chaps who, perhaps, could pull something like this off on storytelling power alone; but three chaps who, though they may dabble in this stuff, clearly define the world their characters inhabit. so i\u2019m at page 200. and i\u2019m gonna try and push on. but it\u2019s tough. do i care when someone dies when death isn\u2019t permanent? and do i care about characters who have seen death reversed but don\u2019t freak the fuck out (which is inconsistent with what does make them freak the fuck out) and who also continue to cry when someone dies? yes, there are some gems along the way, but i think had Solitude been structured as a large collection of interconnected short stories (kinda like a magical realism Winesberg, Ohio) it would've worked much better. this is one of the most beloved books of all time and i\u2019m not so arrogant (damn close) to discount the word of all these people (although I do have gothboy, DFJ, and Borges on my side -- a strong argument for or against anything), and not so blind to see the joy this brings to so many people\u2026 i fully understand it's a powerful piece of work. but i really don\u2019t get it. and i aggressively recommend The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll to any and all who find Solitude to be the end all and be all."], ["\"What is your favourite book, mum?\" How many times have my children asked me that, growing up with a mother who spends most of her time reading - to them, alone, for work, for pleasure - or looking for new books in bookstores wherever we happen to be.\"I can't answer that, there are so many books I love, and in different ways!\"\"Just name one that comes to mind!\"And I said, without really knowing why, and without thinking:\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude!\"\"Why?\"\"Because...\"This novel taught me that chaos and order are two sides of the same medal - called family life. It taught me that sadness and love go hand in hand, and that life is easy and complicated at the same time. It taught me that many wishes actually come true, but never in the way we expect, and most often with a catch. It taught me that sun and rain follow each other, even though we might have to wait for four years, eleven months and two days for rain to stop falling sometimes. It taught me that there are as many recipes for love as there are lovers in the world, and that human beings are lazy and energetic, good and bad, young and old, ugly and beautiful, honest and dishonest, happy and sad, all at the same time, - together and lonely.It taught me that we are forever longing for what we do not have, until we get what we long for. Then we start longing for what we lost when our dreams came true.This novel opened up the world of absurdities to me, and dragged me in like no other. In each member of the Buend\u00eda family, I recognise some relation, or myself, or both. Macondo is the world in miniature, and wherever I go, it follows me like a shadow. It is not rich, peaceful, or beautiful. It is just Macondo. No more, no less.My favourite book? I don't know. There are so many. But I don't think any other could claim to be more loved than this one."], ["One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a tremendous piece of literature. It's not an easy read. You're not going to turn its pages like you would the latest John Grisham novel, or The DaVinci Code. You have to read each page, soaking up every word, immersing yourself in the imagery. Mr. Marquez says that he tells the story as his grandmother used to tell stories to him: with a brick face. That's useful to remember while reading, because that is certainly the tone the book takes. If you can get through the first 50 pages, you will enjoy it. But those 50 are a doozy. It's hard to keep track of the characters, at times (mainly because they are all named Jose Arcadio or Aureliano), but a family tree at the beginning of my edition was helpful. The book follows the Buendia family, from the founding of fictional Macondo to a fitting and fulfilling conclusion. The family goes through wars, marriages, many births and deaths, as well as several technological advances and invasions by gypsies and banana companies (trust me, the banana company is important). You begin to realize, as matriarch Ursula does, that as time passes, time does not really pass for this family, but turns in a circle. And as the circle closes on Macondo and the Buendias, you realize that Mr. Marquez has taken you on a remarkable journey in his literature.

The organization, with sidebars and many illustrating photographs, helps to give variety in an interesting way. Unlike some books that only focus on different types of airplanes, Flight is good in that it elaborates on the specific usage of human flying machines at various points in the last century, tying them into political and economical developments along the way.I especially appreciate the section in which it discusses the early history of human flight in the beginning of the 1900s. Besides the Wright brothers, there are many others who are often less recognized. My biggest complaint is that the sidebar placement makes it difficult to read them along with the text if reading through smoothly, forcing the reader to stop in the middle of a page, read a sidebar, and then continue.Furthermore, it would be nice if the book's title was more clear that the book discusses human flight.Anybody who thinks they might enjoy a specific look at this history or likes to read about transportation should consider this book as a read."], ["An excellent book following and succinctly explaining the most important and history-making aircraft and events in the development of aviation over the past 100 years.

Also enclosed in this volume are a series of short stories, essays, travelogues, and other random snippets, some of which date back over a decade, and most of which have little to do with the next entry, except they were all written by Adams.How, then, to review this book? How does one go about commenting on a collection of miscellanea the author never intended to exist in single-volume form? How does one offer criticism on a draft of an unfinished novel? Indeed, how does one offer any insight into a bricolage of material that, pessimistically, smacks of the publishing industry's frantic attempts to make one last posthumous dollar off of a popular writer?I answer through a personal narrative. Any review ever published is, of course, subjective. This one is more so than even most. There's your grain of salt.My wife bought me this book for my birthday, and I took it with me when I flew home (alone; my wife wasn't able to accompany me) the next week to visit my parents. I read the entire book in one day as I shuffled between airplanes and ticket counters, fast-food stands and uncomfortable plastic seats. Much of what appeared in Salmon... was completely new to me, as I'd somehow never read Adams' shorter works--only his novels. But in short, I was both entranced and maddened: the former at the brilliant intelligence and humor that marble-streaked its way through the pages; the latter at the frustratingly incomplete Dirk Gently novel (imagine if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had only written the first half of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" before suddenly perishing, or if Shakespeare had never completed \"Romeo and Juliet\"). I saw in Salmon... sides of Adams both familiar to me, as in his intelligent satire, and unfamiliar, as in the extemporaneous and atheistic speech he delivered at Cambridge, sections of which forced me to close the cover temporarily while I pondered my own thoughts about the nature of God. Most importantly, through all of these scattered scribblings I saw the inner workings of a man who truly, admirably loved life. And as I turned the last page and stared helplessly at the blank sheet before me, and realized that I had just read the last \"book\" Adams would ever \"publish,\" I was overcome with a sadness so deep and painful that I've never yet been able to even pull Salmon... off of the shelf again, much less read it.Douglas Adams never knew I existed: we never met, exchanged correspondence, or even caught a glimpse of one another in a crowded airport. Yet I consider this man one of my dearest mentors, a man whose writing has shaped the last fifteen years of my life in areas too varied and extensive to number. How then to review a book like this? Simply put, I can't. I'm too close. Even now, five years after the only time I managed to read Salmon..., and six years after Adams' death, I'm too close.Why, then, do I give this book five stars?How could I not?"], ["It's really amazing the amounts of nostalgia that can build up in a person's system before it kinda explodes into a kind of reverse word soup full of interviews, introductions, epilogues, and snippets of novels we wish we had but they were never penned because the author up and died on us.I'm writing of Douglas Adams, of course. I almost didn't re-read this one because I remember it WAS mostly just magazine articles and interesting early computer-tech stuff and ruminations on science, god, and other random bits that fly out of this wonderful man's brain in tightly humorous one-liners that explain not only life, the universe, and everything, but also the way his mind works... and this is all DESPITE the fact that Mr. DNA may or may not have had a functional nose with which to sneeze out those humorous one-liners.So am I rating this entirely based on a man's ability to be clear, funny, horribly learned, and dead?Yes, but it's gotta be more than that, and indeed it is. I loved the man.I grew up reading and re-reading HHGttG about a bazillion times with or without the cheese sandwhich, playing countless hours on the Infrogames title of the same name being simultaneously corrupted and flabbergasted by my inability to create NO TEA, and learning how to fly by distraction.I even decided when I was fourteen that I'd grow a beard for the distinct purpose of giving some poor hapless creature a traveling burial site to not see the rest of the world through.DNA is that kind of man to me.This book reminds me of just how regular a human he is and it is an unabashedly wonderful nostalgia piece to boot. Oh, and we also get a few short stories including Ghengis Kahn, a non-presidential Zaphod, and the opening to the next Dirk Gently book which would have been fantastic, I'm sure, had he written it.*sigh*Still, what a wonderful thing it is. Farewell, Mr. Adams. (Yes. I know I'm 16 years late. It's just that this book was compiled shortly after his death, so I feel it fresh. Sue me.)"], ["I waited sixteen-and-a-half years to read this and I just about managed to get through it without bawling my eyes out. Douglas Adams was the first author to make me laugh uproariously, back when I was a wee nipper. Sure, Roald Dahl had given me a few chuckles, but it wasn't until I read Hitchhikers for the first time that I realised a book could make me laugh so much I nearly wet myself.As such, this was a bittersweet experience. Reading Adams' unpublished work, including several chapters of a new but never to be finished Dirk Gently novel, gave a new definition to laughing through one's tears. I'm glad I read it but it's going to take a while to recover. It's a good job I had my towel..."], ["This technically is the 3rd book in the Dirk Gently series. Sadly, it's not really a Dirk Gently book. You see, before Douglas Adams could write/finish this third book, he died of a sudden heart attack in a gym in Santa Barbara in 2001.But he left behind fragments of chapters or chapters and their rewritings and a lot of other notes on his various computers. His wife, daughter, agent, editor, assistant and other people then pieced together what is now The Salmon of Doubt which would have been the title of the third book.This book is divided into three parts:1) Life2) The Universe3) And Everythingwhich is a tribute to his Hitchhiker book(s).There is much more in this book than simply another story (or the beginning of one). The first two parts are filled with snippets, random thoughts DA wrote down about tea and cookies and computers and other stuff, interviews for various magazines and newspapers he did, as well as speeches he gave for all sorts of occasions.For example, did you know how much Douglas Adams got involved with environmentalism? Yes, this giant (literally) of a man did not just love all things Apple, but thanks to a trip done with biologist Mark Carwardine, he also became a staunch defender of bio-diversity. Most notably, he loved and tried to protect rhinos. He even climbed the Kilimandscharo in a rhino costume in order to raise money for \"Save the Rhino\" (a wildlife conservation organisation). Here he is:Naturally, it was much more of an ordeal than he had originally thought, which he explains in his very unique hilarious way (seriously, I almost suffocated when reading his account of that trip).My favourite story though is of the cookies. Here it is:This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I\u2019d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It\u2019s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here\u2019s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There\u2019s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There\u2019s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know\u2026 But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn\u2019t do anything, and thought, \"What am I going to do?\"In the end I thought \"Nothing for it, I\u2019ll just have to go for it.\", and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, \"That settled him.\" But it hadn\u2019t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. \u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2026\u201d I mean, it doesn\u2019t really work.We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.Typically British. And, strangely, or not so strangely because it's typical DA, a perfect anecdote about life.This book, therefore, grants a unique insight into the author's mind, his anxiety that sometimes bordered on depression, his early years and struggle, the sudden fame and success, the maddening battle with Hollywood, his private life even. And it shows how beloved and respected he was by family, friends and colleagues. I mean, Stephen Fry penned the Foreword and Richard Dawkins the Epilogue! Just the list of people he knew and often also how he got to know them is staggering.Alas, this is the end. So to speak. Fortunately, I can look forward to reading the 4 other Hitchhiker volumes as I haven't read those yet. It's amazing what kind of a legacy this man left behind (not just through his books, but also radio programmes, BBC contributions, movies, TV shows etc).Trigger Warning:This book is sometimes difficult to read; at least to those people who mourn the author, or generally feel for people who have to cope with sudden loss. It sure made me cry at certain points."], ["In early 1998 (or was it \u201897?), I experienced one of the most heady experiences of my life. A literary idol approached me at a conference we were attending in France (it was in Cannes, but it was a media festival rather than the more famous annual event), invited me to join him at dinner and debate the existence of God. Douglas Adams, self-proclaimed radical atheist, wanted to consider God\u2019s existence (or lack thereof) with me. As a minister, I\u2019d like to write myself in as the hero and claim that I at least put a dent in the famous atheist\u2019s armor. We had a fascinating conversation and I\u2019d like to think that I pushed him into rethinking his position, but that\u2019s not very realistic. Hang on! This does relate to this collection of Adams\u2019 writing in his last years, especially those reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt.In our discussion, I pulled out the well-worn rubber duck of apologetics. I told him that he was dishonest in calling himself an atheist instead of an agnostic. I didn\u2019t realize that this was the most offensive opening I could try. I hadn\u2019t read his interview with American Atheists where he asserted that Agnostic did not adequately express his position because he was \u201cconvinced that there is no God.\u201d (p. 96) But I blundered into the conversation with my classic approach that it is intellectual arrogance to claim to \u201cknow\u201d that there is no God by appealing to an illustration in one of Rudy Rucker\u2019s books on multidimensionality. This took my literary hero off guard because \u201cmultidimensionality\u201d was a great fascination for him. I told him that certainty of the non-existence of God might well be trying to decide a multidimensional issue via the limited dimensions we have discovered in our empirical science. Then, I conceded that being \u201cconvinced\u201d was different than \u201cknowing,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t objectively any better than a person of faith being \u201cconvinced.\u201d I scored the opening round a stand-off. I\u2019m not sure what Adams would have scored it. He must have been somewhat satisfied because he shifted gears.He told me that there was no rational need for the existence of God. This, of course, is a different question. Unlike my typical sermon, I opted to walk the tightrope of suggested that God is a useful concept\u2014EVEN (don\u2019t be horrified at my speculation, true believers) if a personal God didn\u2019t exist. I told him that I personally believe in a personal God, but for purposes of discussion, we should consider whether there really was no rational need for the existence of God. I asserted that, contrary to Adams\u2019 hero Richard Dawkins for whom I expressed admiration for his science and reservation for his assertions which went beyond the acceptable evidence, the idea of God was more helpful than harmful.Adams was skeptical (duh!) and attempted two analogies which I found interesting. He pulled some British currency out of his wallet and suggested that burning it wouldn\u2019t warm you, eating it wouldn\u2019t feed you, and wearing it wouldn\u2019t cover you, but that it had purchasing power because the state stood behind it. But, he suggested that you need the assurance that the state exists in order for the currency to have any effect whatsoever. I countered (maybe a feeble parry at best) that, for the bulk of the British population, they had no idea of the nature of money supply, national deficit, budget viability, and governmental oversight of that currency but had an essential faith in the government. One doesn\u2019t have to have all of the economics behind the currency explained satisfactorily in order to use the money. In the same way, one doesn\u2019t have to understand everything about God in order to benefit from the idea of God. Therefore, there may well be a rational need for God. Before I explain the next analogy, imagine my amazement to see the late 1998 speech from Adams that was reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt: \u201cMoney is a completely fictitious entity, but it\u2019s very powerful in our world; we all have wallets, which have got notes in them, but what can these notes do? You can\u2019t breed them, you can\u2019t stir-fry them, you can\u2019t live in them, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do with them, other than exchange them with each other\u2014and as soon as we exchange them with each other, all sorts of powerful things happen, because it\u2019s a fiction that we\u2019ve all subscribed to. \u2026if the money vanished, the entire cooperative structure that we have would implode.\u201d (p. 140) Did our discussion bear fruit? Adams didn\u2019t change his mind about the existence of God. He merely recognized the utility of the concept of God. Egotistically, I had thought to convince him one step at a time, but perhaps, I merely pushed him to fortify and develop his philosophical position to allow for a utilitarian (he called it \u201cartificial\u201d) God. The conversation was still stimulating, especially so when Adams began to expound about Feng Shui. Now, maybe I wasn\u2019t listening, but I thought he was expressing skepticism about Feng Shui, so I said that it wouldn\u2019t really make any different that he and I don\u2019t believe that dragons exist, but that the concept of the dragon may help people design more comfortable and functional living spaces even if no dragon ever sets foot in the dwelling (and presumably they would not). Therefore, I suggested that even if I was wrong about the personal God whom I serve, my life may be better and more meaningful as a result of my conceptual idea of God\u2019s involvement in my life. Now, admittedly, Adams\u2019 hero of evolutionary arrogance (Richard Dawkins) wouldn\u2019t concede this as said individual perceives the very concept to be harmful due to the fundamentalist extremes which have wreaked havoc in human history, but it seemed like the approach caused Adams to pause. Again, that could be arrogance on my part. I WISH I had impacted Adams and this could merely be wish-fulfillment. However, I was delighted to read on p. 146: \u201cYou figure out how the dragon\u2019s going to be happy here, and lo, and behold, you\u2019ve suddenly got a place that makes sense for other organic creatures, such as ourselves, to live in.\u201d Do I think I won a debate with this man who was, in so many ways, my intellectual superior? Naaah! I just like to think that our conversation pushed him in a direction he was already considering. Do I wish I could have convinced him of the existence of a personal God who cared about Him and wanted to be involved in his life and life\u2019s work? Absolutely! Do I still admire him as a person and his creative output? Absolutely!There were a few other lines that I really enjoyed in this book of essays, interviews, introductions to books, albums, and concerts, speeches, and rambling thoughts before I got into what I really procured the book to read, the last Dirk Gently story. I loved his line about art when he said, \u201cI think the idea of art kills creativity.\u201d (p. 158) And, I loved the story about his awkward experience in the train station with the cookies (pp. 150-151). It appears that he was sharing a table while waiting for a train. He had his coffee and a packet of cookies along with his morning newspaper. As he was reading his paper, the fellow reached over, opened the bag of cookies, too one out and began to eat it. Some British reserve kept him from confronting the man for his effrontery, so they actually ate the cookies in uncomfortable silence one-for-one. When the man left, Adams moved his paper and discovered an identical, but unopened bag of cookies under his paper. He was amused that he had thought so ill of the man while he was erroneously consuming the other man\u2019s cookies. And he knew why this had occurred, but the other man never discovered the punch line. In the U.S., of course, there would have been a loud vocal confrontation at the very least. As for the title piece, the bare-bones portion of the unfinished Salmon of Doubt, it was delightful\u2014even in its admittedly unpolished form. I followed the tortured logic of the cabbie who assumed that since people said, \u201cFollow that cab!\u201d in the movies and he, having had a long tenure as a cabbie had never heard that phrase, he must indeed have been the cab that all other cabs were following (pp. 249-250). I rolled my eyes with empathy when Dirk discovered a freezer cabinet full of \u201cold, white, clenched things that he was now too frightened to try to identify.\u201d (p. 226) I chuckled at the description of Gently\u2019s office that was \u201cold and dilapidated and remained standing more out of habit rather than from any inherent structural integrity\u201d (p. 238) I really loved the slam on typical airline personnel speak (Airline Syllable Stress Syndrome\u2014p. 253). I was sad that the book wasn\u2019t complete, even in its current form."], ["What a delight to revisit the mind of Douglas Adams. I like that this is a collection of emails, speeches, one-liners, and rants. Yes, there's the start of a novel in there, that he may or may not have intended to call the Salmon of Doubt. The result is so much better than it sounds like it's going to be: Douglas Adams died, but his buddy knew his password and emptied his Mac onto a CD, the various unfinished writings were lightly edited and printed as this. But gosh, am I ever glad that they did, because there's some exceptional writing in here, hilARious, as he always was, and glitteringly insightful. His projections on the future of technology, from the 90's, are pretty brilliant, and the piece de resistance is the speech to Cambridge on the purpose of God."], ["A collection of essays, speeches, ramblings unearthed on his hard drive(s), one short story culled from a BBC annual, and the titular unfinished Dirk Gently novel. The essays are breezy and witty, often lacking focus when discussing science and technology, but comprise (realistically) the most readable of his non-fiction output. There are some readers, yours included, who feel Adams spent himself on the Hitchhiker\u2019s books: although the Dirk Gentlys were absurdist romps sutured with awesome logic, they didn\u2019t hang together as novels. The short excerpt from The Salmon of Doubt, however, might prove me wrong: the usual warmth and humour is present, although in nascent form, (the narration even slips from third into first person, a sign of Adams\u2019s dissatisfaction). But all in all, nobody who loves Adams could resist reading this book, despite snoozing through the travel/nature pieces to get to the stuff they want. It\u2019s a pleasing gallimaufry. Savour it, because there is no more."], ["A kind of poor book which just happens to be filled with awesome. I'd really like a well-organized and indexed collection of all of Douglas Adams' short writings. Round up all the columns and editorials he wrote, the text he did for his websites, everything, and get it all tied up with a bow and some context. Salmon isn't that collection; the writings are just tossed into poorly-defined buckets with no real TOC to speak of (and let us not speak of indexes), and there's no real way to tell what's missing or what's even important. There's some occasional interesting serendipity to be had, but eh.On the other hand, it's Douglas Adams, bringer of joy and wry, good-natured English despair, and even inferior collections of his work are crucial."], ["If you love Douglas Adams this book is an absolute must read. It's got some great incite into the man who could make a pot of petunias think to itself, 'Not again.' A large part of my enjoyment was finding out about Adams as a person, and in turn finding out that I've got some stuff in common with him. I mean sure I haven't ridden a stingray like he has or written the funniest books of all time and granted I'm not British, BUT we do make our tea the same way, we're both have the same religious beliefs in our complete lack of having them (did you know atheists have conventions? I didn't), and, well I can't think of another one right now, but we're like peas in a pod. Trust me.Plus he recommends some great authors and tells some hysterical true stories. Damn it, I miss him.

Twelve chapters on how stress is going to kill you, followed by six chapters on why stress is stressful, when it's not, and what we can do about it.If you're a worrier, this may not be the book for you. I won't lie, it upset me in the beginning. There are so many ways that stress can affect your health, your memory, the way you age, how you deal with stressors, and even how your children deal with stressors. The book can become a source of stress itself, one that far outweighs the few methods it gives for dealing with stress. But it addresses a lot of important issues, like the economics of stress and the way poverty and pay inequality have life-long health ramifications. It's not just about stress on a personal level, but a social, cultural, and political one. It also looks at the role stress plays in mental illness, pain, infertility, and addiction.The science can be quite dense at times, but Sapolsky is good at walking you through it and recalling topics he introduced earlier so you never have to feel like you're studying for something. He makes this easy to read, even if the subject is a difficult one. He's a great writer with a sense of humor, an obvious love of science, and respect for views that aren't his own. He offers multiple approaches for any given problem and points out questions we don't have answers for yet.Four stars. Good science writing that challenges assumptions and doesn't take itself too seriously. Also includes extensive end notes and an index.

He's clearly aware that his book might be read by a wide range of audiences, and strives to provide something for everyone. I'll definitely be working my way through the rest of his catalog.The book is fascinating, too, although as he notes many times, thinking about and addressing stress is difficult, because trying to act to reduce stress can itself be stressful. As he elucidates what's currently known about the links between stress and disease, a lot of interesting things emerge, some of which are essentially throwaway trivia, like the idea that anti-depressant medication takes a while to work on people that are clinically depressed because of the physiological nature of depression; he doesn't really spell it out, but the obvious corollary is that is someone takes AD medication and instantly feels better, they're probably not actually depressed.

If you're looking for a solid book on recommendations to deal with stress, this might not be it.To the author's credit, he is trying to be as accurate as possible, and therefore I believe he is trying his best to recommend the most scientifically accurate practice to deal with stress; and sadly, there may not be many, although there is a few practical one such as exercise and meditation."], ["This is hands down the best medical book I have ever read.

He outlines how modern stress triggers that have nothing to do with immediate survival - whether brought on from traffic, bad bosses, bad relationships - can be linked to exacerbating the development of almost every modern epidemic from cancer to colitis, depression to dwarfism, diabetes to diarrhea, heart disease to infertility to immune disorders.

This book assists all players in their efforts to improve, and provides fresh insights into the opening and early middlegame.<br /><br />Rowson presents many new ideas on how Black should best combat White's early initiative, and make use of the extra information that he gains as a result of moving second. For instance, he shows that in some cases a situation he calls 'Zugzwang Lite' can arise, where White finds himself lacking any constructive moves. He also takes a close look at the theories of two players who, in differing styles, have specialized in championing Black's cause: Mihai Suba and Andras Adorjan.

It\u2019s one I\u2019m a little embarrassed to admit. The problem is not with the writing or the characters that Stevenson has created; it\u2019s not even with the plot. The problem resides with Kermit the Frog. (Stay with me here!) I grew up watching the muppets. I became slightly obsessed with them. I kind of wanted to join them. So, whenever I read about Captain Smollett and Long John Silver all I can see is Kermit fighting Tim Curry! Therefore, I just can\u2019t take this book seriously. Well, at least not completely. The Muppet Treasure Island is such a great film; it\u2019s hilarious. This book was much more serious. The pirates in here aren\u2019t singing toys; they\u2019re hardened criminals that created the pirate stereotype. They\u2019re the sort of men you don\u2019t want on your ship because they\u2019d likely cut your throat in your sleep. They might wake you up first if they\u2019re feeling kind. So, they wouldn\u2019t try and gain your trust by singing you a jolly song about piracy, like Tim and his muppet mates would. But, muppet based comparison aside, this is a good novel. I did quite enjoy it. It all begins when the young Jim Hawkins comes across a map for buried treasure, except he hasn\u2019t got any money to fund the voyage. He  Gonzo and Rizzo goes alone and seeks the help of  Fozzie Bear  Squire Trelawney. As a member of the Victorian gentry, he takes the map for himself with the intention of filling his own coffers with the loot. He\u2019s not a very nice  bear  guy, and he\u2019s not overly intelligent either. In his frugality he accidently hires a group of twisted  muppets  pirates that, unsurprisingly, mutiny against him. This all sounds terrible, I know. But, it\u2019s not all bad because the ship\u2019s captain is none other than  Kermit the Frog  Captain Smollett who is absolutely in love with  Miss Piggy  no one. Indeed, Smollett is in direct contrast to the money driven  Fozzie  Trelawney because he is everything he is not; he is brave and honourable; he is completely true to his word. He is competing, unknowingly, for the attention of Jim. The young boy is looking for a farther figure, and in Silver and Smollett he sees two potential role models, and two potential life choices. It all works out in the end though because this is a  muppet movie adventure book after all. In all seriousness, it is an exciting book. But, for me, that\u2019s all it is. There are no hidden motives or dark secrets. Everything is straight forward, clean cut and simple. It is a nice easy read. Stevenson\u2019s masterpiece is most definitely  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde. That\u2019s where the real mystery is at. But, it doesn\u2019t have muppets\u2026.."], ["YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!!!This is the iconic novel about pirates that it stands as the best example in this topic and easily one of the most adapted to other media novels in any genre.I can remember having watched several adaptations, live action films, animated movies, even an animated film using animals as the characters, there is the Muppets' one, a Japanese anime TV series, an European mini-series taking the story to outer space starring Anthony Quinn, the animated remake of that version by Disney and the current Starz channel prequel TV series \"Black Sails\". Just to mention the ones that I have watched but there are a lot of more adaptations.While the topic of pirates is a popular one, I think that there aren't much novels about it. At least not examples really worthy of reading them. Obviously there are some here and there, but taking in account how much options one has in other topics in literature, pirates has been a concept seldom touched with success.However, this novel was able to keep on the mind of everybody the storytelling appeal of the topic of pirates inspiring successes on other media such as Japanese anime \"Captain Harlock\" and live actions films of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".For all that and its own merit, Treasure Island keeps retaining the crown as the best novel about pirates. Characters like Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Ben Gunn, Captain Smollett and of course, Long John Silver have become iconic in the universe of literature. Even they have been so admired that other authors couldn't resist to makes homages/mentions of them on their own novels, such examples like on Peter Pan.Its appealing is obvious depending the readers, many young ones can't resist to be amazed by Jim Hawkins who is 14 years old but he is able to keep up in the middle of adult characters and even being a key character in the success of the adventure.To readers and writers of all ages, certainly the character of Long John Silver stands out as one of the best developed characters in the history of literature becoming a model to many following similar ones. He is able to do ruthless things but he has a code, he has limits, and not matter that he is not a nice person, there are things that he never will do and for that, he is a complicated and truly interesting character to read about.Not matter how was on real life, Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, was able to show a romantic picture of pirates' world with now iconic elements like islands with treasures, maps with \"x\"'s, fearful papers with a black spot, peglegs, eye patches, parrots on shoulders, but above all, he had no doubt to show how dangerous and murderous can be real pirates."], ["Three items worthy of note in R. L. Stevenson's classic treasure, \"Treasure Island\":1) There are a ton of tropes!

He's the go-between of the two fighting groups, the one who bargains with the villain Long John Silver (mmm.... breaded fish and shrimp...) and propels the narrative forward. He's the center; a dreamer; while he loses his humility he attains a coming-of-age wisdom that peaks at the point where he brandishes a pistol for the first time.3)The plot resembles a Hollywood blockbuster. There is very little inaction, but when it occurs (such as the villain's cliched soliloquy or the factions grunting against their enemies) it does decelerate the pace of the story.

This is typically seen as a children's book (although some of the sea and pirate terminology is quite specific and complex) and having the first person perspective shown from the view of a young kid adds to the remarkableness of the story. The fact Jim is a young man who performs extraordinary deeds, often going against the odds on the Hispaniola (the trusty vessel that takes them to treasure island) or the island itself amongst hardened sea-faring men means we really have his back and support his deeds throughout the tale. We feel close to him because of how well Stevenson writes this character. Every time the plot progresses, it is because of an amazing deed that Jim has done, often on his own back without the consultation of the most senior members of the group. We route for him every second of the way because he is us. Things don't work out smoothly when they get to the Island. A divide occurs. Mutiny some might say. A split is presented so Jim, Dr, Squire and a few trusted men are on one side. Old pirates who were part of Captain Flint's crew rally under who we thought was a nice dude. Long John Silver.He is the most complex character in this short book. Peg legged, parrot on his shoulder \"pieces of eight\" are some of his characterisations that you will probably see some 12-year-old child imitating this Halloween. You never quite know where you stand with Silver. He starts off seeming good. Jim overhears his plot of mutiny whilst hiding in a barrel. At that point, he is portrayed as purely evil but towards the end, he seems more human and complex. Sticking up for Jim Hawkins when the rest of his sea mates want to kill the poor lad. Other notable characters are Ben Gunn, the Robinson Crusoe-esque marooned island dweller and Dr. Livesey. It is ingeniously written that in such a short book we can care about so many of the players and their complexity is unrivaled. There are lots of cool scenes. Shootouts on the Island between the two factions. Jim vs. Israel Hands. Meeting Ben Gunn and when Jim goes back to the safe haven of the wooden castle expecting to regroup with his friends but alas... it is not to be. I will end this review with a few pirate clich\u00e9s that frequent Treasure Island. \"Shiver my timbers\" \"Shipshape\" \"Jolly Roger\" & \"Pieces of Eight\" come to mind. I really enjoyed this. So different to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde that I have previously read by Stevenson. Yet, that makes a good author, being able to flaunt his linguistic skills in various genres making tales such as these which will last forever.

And then you finally saw the third one on DVD when you were home from the hospital after almost dying of mono,who knew that could happen, but apparently it really messes with your liver, and the movie was so bad you couldn't even stay awake through the literally 45-minute long action sequence that caps it all off, and besides, it makes no sense at all, with everyone betraying everyone else so many times you need a flow chart to follow the plot?I suppose we have RLS and Treasure Island to blame for all that. Because this is the book that established what we think of when we think of pirates, from skull & crossbones banners to peg legs to squawking shoulder-mounted parrots to maps with big red Xs and yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. It's kind of weird to think about: those concepts are so ingrained in our culture (see: International Talk Like a Pirate Day), and yet they all stem from this rather innocuous adventure story for children.But it is a really great adventure, which is probably why it became so iconic. This book is 130 years old but exhibits none of the mustiness of late Victorian-era fiction (turgid description being the chief offender, which you know if you've tried to slog through Jules Verne, and how in the world do you make submarines and sea monsters boring? Ask Jules). The adventure clips along quite nicely, moving from murder and mayhem on dry land to mutiny and more murder on the sea, and then to a creepy island filled with treasure and other dangers. Long John Silver is a crafty and compelling villain, switching sides more often than Benjamin Linus (hey, speaking of islands). Even though I knew basically where the story was going, it was a fast and engaging read, with a lot of creative sequences of suspense. The only sections that bogged down a bit were the brief but somewhat technical descriptions of the ship, the sails, how the waves turned it this way and that, etc. I don't know starboard from port, and I don't care to, RLS. So get back to the parts with the talking parrot."], ["As Indiana Jones once, rather astutely pointed out, when it comes to treasure \"X never, ever marks the spot\". Well, it does if you're a pirate, which basically means that as a pirate you have a statistically much higher chance of finding treasure than any archaeologist ever would. I find this a bit unfortunate and if someone had presented me with this hard and fast evidence I would have ticked the pirate box and not the archaeologist box on my careers worksheet at school. Instead, I have to make do with reading Treasure Island and fantasising about my ideal bespoke treasure island (emeralds growing on trees- I know this is an arboreal unlikelihood but it's my fantasy so back off; lagoons filled with sapphires, gold dubloons in huge heapy piles at the foot of azure blue waterfalls and knuckle sized diamonds to be chipped off the walls of underground caverns). Stevenson's Treasure Island is much less of a Disney-esque fantasy and Jim Hawkins, narrator and salty sea dog in the making, is forced to pit his wits against the wiliest of all pirates, Long John Silver in a race to retrieve the booty. After finding an oil-skin map in a dead mans chest (nice Robert, very nice) Jim sets off to find some trustworthy (or gullible) adults. Jim must be in possession of some serious powers of persuasion because within minutes the good squire and his associates are rustling up a ship (no mean feat when a schooner could set you back \u00a36000 and your chance of surviving the voyage was slim), tightening their buckanneering belts and getting ready to hit the high seas. It turns out the ships cook is more than he seems though and not to be underestimated (I wonder if JF Lawton, the writer of Under Siege was a Treasure Island fan, after all he served up Casey Rybeck, the most underestimated ships cook of all time).Caribbean capers ensue as Long John Silver serves up a melting pot of mendacity in an attempt to get his hand on Captain Flint's treasure. Jim Hawkins proves he's tougher than a soused herring that's been at the bottom of a barrel for a year and successfully repels the Island siege before hoisting the main sail, jibing -ho and heading for Britain. The other pirates are left marooned as a punishment and their skeletons will be unearthed 250 years from the time of telling during the construction of a Sandals adult holiday resort. Personally I think I'd rather be marooned than go to Sandals."], ["ARRrrr, me reader! Embark now on a voyage of high seas adventure with scurvy pirates, honest jack-tar sailors, marooned souls, and a vast treasure buried on some faraway island. Aye, that's Treasure Island! Weigh anchor, me laddie! The wind's always fair for gettin' this wonderful tale under way! HAHAAAAARRRGGGHHHAAAaaaa\u2026.omg, that's exhausting."], ["Book Review\n\n4 out of 5 stars to Treasure Island, a coming-of-age-of-sort novel, written in 1882 by Robert Louis Stevenson. I read this book as a young adult when I received it as a Christmas present from an aunt and uncle. At first, although I knew it was a classic, I wasn't too anxious to jump into it. I wasn't a big fan of pirates and boats. I wasn't a normal kid, what can I tell you. But... it was a gift and I thought I should give it a chance. And once I did, I loved it. I had read Peter Pan recently and felt a kismet connection of sorts between them. From the adventures to the bonds, to the test of good versus evil, the book had so many wonderful moments. And since then, I've sampled many different iterations, from movies to other books with pirate stories, all the way to Once Upon a Times interpretation. It's truly a remarkable story that helps young adults figure out how to approach a world full of fears, hopes and questions. And to think it's a pirate and a cook who help you to figure some of it out. But it's more. There's bonding. And team work. And treasure hunting. And challenges. And mystery. All culminating in reaching one's goals in ways you didn't necessarily expect.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp.There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath.... and then a voice from above utters the words: \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, Dent!\u201d Arthur Dent has every reason to be both puzzled and angry at the blue skinned alien called  Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged  who came over the aeons only to insult him. In the previous two volume the hitchhiking Earthman served as a sort of lightning rod, attracting all sort of (explosive) troubles on his head. He was stranded on prehistoric earth as the result of a complex sequence of events that had involved his being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he had ever dreamed existed, and though life has now turned very, very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy.He hadn\u2019t been blown up now for five years. Arthur Dent should actually rejoice at the respite he gets and at being back on his previously annihilated planet, but prehistoric times had very little to offer in the entertaining department. His melancholic mood is lyrically captured by an author who is more famous for his comedy chops: In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn\u2019t cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know you\u2019ve taken all the baths you can usefully take that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o\u2019clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.  (view spoiler)[ the passage is referring to the troubles with immortality that Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged is experiencing, but for me it has an universal resonance with regard to my own empty and dark weekends with nothing to do  (hide spoiler)]Escape comes in the unusual form of a galloping Chesterfield sofa, but readers familiar with the style of Douglas Adams already know to be prepared for the unexpected and to always have a towel handy before they embark on a new adventure. Arthur Dent and his companion in exile Ford Perfect should also be more careful what they wish for, because times are about to get interesting and the boredom of prehistoric times will be sorely missed : an old friend, a planet designer specialising in shaping fjords, has need of their assistance for nothing less than the saving of the Universe. \u201cDeep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe,\u201d said Slartibartfast, \u201cthere is a reason.\u201dFord glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things. [...] \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cWe are going to confront an ancient nightmare of the Universe.\u201d\u201cAnd where are you going to drop us off?\u201d\u201cI will need your help.[...] A curse has arisen from the mists of time. A curse which will engulf the Galaxy in fire and destruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a premature doom. I mean it,\u201d he added.\u201cSounds like a bad time,\u201d said Ford; \u201cwith luck I\u2019ll be drunk enough not to notice. [...] My doctor says that I have a malformed public duty gland and a natural defficiency in moral fiber, and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes.\u201d Move over, Mr. Flash Gordon! Arthur Dent is taking over the role of saviour of the Universe and the quest starts right here on Earth (after alittle time travel on the Bistromathic spaceship) when alien war robots from the planet Krikkit are stealing a piece of junk from the middle of a sports field. For many readers, a piece of burned wood from Melbourne, Australia in the year 1882 would mean nothing, to others it is a holy relic of national pride. For Slartibartfast and his unwilling heroes, it is an artefact of ancient power and evil. The game you know as cricket is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory that can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races of the Galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into what I am afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game. ... and so the journey into danger and adventure begins anew, with only a towel and a small tourist guide in my pockets, ready to witness the neverending wonders of the Universe.Wheeee!!! Sign me in for the trip, Mr. Adams! Each episode is better than the previous one for me, and I am in awe at the inventivity of the setting, the satirical sharpness of the sketches, the all embracing and gentle acceptance of our human condition in a cold and hostile Universe.

Steel walls were erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps and three major armies were installed, so that no one would ever have to hear Prak speak. What exactly did this man Prak know that was so dangerous to the establishement? Was he another Snowden shouting to the world that the emperor has no clothes on? We might never know more than the fact that it has something to do with frogs, because when Prak lays eyes on Arthur Dent mayhem issues: He howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backward onto the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with laughter, kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest. Gradually he subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell back again howling with laughter. Eventually he fell asleep. In the end, laughter may be the best weapon we have at our disposal against the tyranny of people and the tyranny of time.

The only excitement, in the five stranded years here( or is it four?), came a couple of trips around the Sun, ago. A spaceship landed in front of the cave of Arthur's, coming down the ramp, a tall gray green alien stranger, and said, \"You're a jerk , Dent\". The flabbergasted Arthur, mumbled some incoherent noises, that should have been words, before the alien went up the ramp and left as quickly as he arrived. This mysterious creature, is an immortal, so lacking in things to do, that he devised an activity, maybe not the most worthwhile, he himself acknowledges, and quite impossible also.

I don't think so!"], ["People may have noticed that I've recently become very interested in theories of physics which involve multiple universes. I've spent a fair amount of time over the last few weeks reading about them and discussing the ideas.Since it's buried in one of my other reviews, let me present my conclusions explicitly. To my surprise, I discover that there is a great deal of evidence to support the claim that we are only one of many universes, and, moreover, that we know what these other universes are. The theory isn't particularly flaky or speculative. Or, to be more exact, there is an abundance of flaky and speculative theories, but there is also one which is rooted in mainstream science and already comes close to explaining Life, the Universe and Everything. The idea is simple. There is a way of looking at quantum mechanics - the so-called Many Worlds Interpretation - which, roughly, means that everything which might have happened actually did happen in some alternate universe. These alternate universes are as just real as ours. Now, one's first reaction to this ought to be that it's nonsense, or at best no more than playing with words. It's easy to say that what might have been is real, but does that actually mean anything? Well, it turns out there is a strong argument which supports the claim that many universes exist. When you look at the different physical constants - things like the strength of gravity, the strength of the electromagnetic force, the relative masses of the proton and the electron, and so on - a weird pattern emerges. There is no known reason why any of these constants should have the values they possess. They appear to be arbitrary numbers. But, if these numbers were even slightly different, life would be completely impossible. The most straightforward way to explain this fact is to suppose that there are many universes, with many different settings for the constants; we happen to live in one of the very few universes where the numbers came out right for life to happen. This argument is presented in detail in Martin Rees's \nBefore the Beginning\n.Next, let's look at the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics (MWI). Everyone who reads SF novels has heard of this, but I had always dismissed it as a fringe theory with little credibility. I was surprised to learn from Brian Greene's \nThe Hidden Reality\n that the MWI has steadily been gaining ground over the last 30 years, and is now considered completely respectable. As Greene explains, everyone agrees on the mathematical theory behind quantum mechanics, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. People know how to do the calculations, and these calculations work spectacularly well. The disagreement is about what the equations actually mean. Greene, and other people you can easily find on the Web, say that the MWI is in fact the simplest and most natural way to give intuitive significance to the mathematics of quantum physics; the traditional \"Copenhagen interpretation\" due to Niels Bohr and his colleagues is close to mysticism when you try to pin it down, since it makes the human observer an integral part of physics. Quantum physicists are sufficiently uneasy about the choices that the most popular approach is not to ascribe any meaning to the mathematics, but just perform the calculations without asking what they refer to. This is evidently an unusual way to do science.To summarize, the most natural way to interpret our mainstream scientific theory is to say that there are many alternate universes. The physical evidence also suggests that there are many alternate universes. If the notion weren't so startling, one would just conclude that, since theory and experiment coincide, there must be many alternate universes. There are plenty of loose ends to tie up, and you can question the logic in several places. (Robert has done a good job of presenting the case for the defense in the comment thread to my Greene review). I still can't quite bring myself to believe it emotionally, but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes. The other explanations are even more far-fetched; as Sherlock Holmes says, once you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true. Check it out for yourself and see if you agree.___________________________________Looking around for material on the Many Worlds Interpretation, I found a paper by Max Tegmark where the following interesting passage appears:Is there ... any experiment that could distinguish between ... the MWI and the Copenhagen interpretation using currently available technology? The author can only think of one: a form of quantum suicide in a spirit similar to so-called quantum roulette. It requires quite a dedicated experimentalist, since it is amounts to an iterated and faster version of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment with you as the cat.The apparatus is a \"quantum gun\" which each time its trigger is pulled measures the z-spin of a particle. It is connected to a machine gun that fires a single bullet if the result is \"down\" and merely makes an audible click if the result is \"up\". The details of the trigger mechanism are irrelevant (an experiment with photons and a half-silvered mirror would probably be cheaper to implement) as long as the timescale between the quantum bit generation and the actual firing is much shorter than that characteristic of human perception, say 0.01 seconds. The experimenter first places a sand bag in front of the gun and tells her assistant to pull the trigger ten times. [Everyone] agrees that the \"shut-up-and-calculate\" prescription applies here, and predict that she will hear a seemingly random sequence of shots and duds such as \"bang-click-bang-bang-bang-click-clickbang-click-click.\" She now instructs her assistant to pull the trigger ten more times and places her head in front of the gun barrel. This time the shut-up-and-calculate recipe is inapplicable, since probabilities have no meaning for an observer in the dead state, and the contenders will differ in their predictions. In interpretations where there is an explicit non-unitary collapse, she will be either dead or alive after the first trigger event, so she should expect to perceive perhaps a click or two (if she is moderately lucky), then \"game over\", nothing at all.In the MWI, on the other hand, the state after the first trigger event is [...] Since there is exactly one observer having perceptions both before and after the trigger event, and since it occurred too fast to notice, the MWI prediction is that [the experimenter] will hear \"click\" with 100% certainty. When her assistant has completed his unenviable assignment, she will have heard ten clicks, and concluded that collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics are ruled out at a confidence level of 99.9%. If she wants to rule them out at \"ten sigma\", she need merely increase n by continuing the experiment a while longer. Occasionally, to verify that the apparatus is working, she can move her head away from the gun and suddenly hear it going off intermittently. Note, however, that almost all terms in the final superposition will have her assistant perceiving that he has killed his boss. Many physicists would undoubtedly rejoice if an omniscient genie appeared at their death bed, and as a reward for life-long curiosity granted them the answer to a physics question of their choice. But would they be as happy if the genie forbade them from telling anybody else? Perhaps the greatest irony of quantum mechanics is that if the MWI is correct, then the situation is quite analogous if, once you feel ready to die, you repeatedly attempt quantum suicide: you will experimentally convince yourself that the MWI is correct, but you can never convince anyone else!But is Tegmark really correct in saying that the experimenter would not convince anyone else of the correctness of the MWI? Imagine that you are the assistant in the universe where the experimenter succeeds in cheating death 100 times in a row, after having explained what she is about to do. I, at least, would find this convincing. I wouldn't be able to repeat the experiment (only the person risking their life can do that), but it would still seem way too strange to ascribe to pure chance.It seems to me that the argument about lucky settings in the physical constants making life possible is related to Tegmark's thought experiment with the quantum gun. We have all been the beneficiaries of, in effect, a long string of clicks, as opposed to bullets. The question is whether this is good evidence of the existence of other quantum worlds. I can see that opinions are divided!___________________________________So I was chatting with a CERN physicist today (imagine other people peacefully knitting in the background), and I took the opportunity to ask him why the picture I describe above isn't the standard one. \"Well, it is more or less the standard one!\" he said. \"At least among cosmologists.\"\"In that case...\" I began, but he cut me short.\"However, it's not the standard picture among theoretical particle physicists,\" he continued. \"And for experimental particle physicists, it's a yet another picture.\"\"But... if they all know they have different pictures of what's happening, why don't they discuss it until they've agreed which is right?\" I asked helplessly.That CERN shrug again. It's starting to look familiar."], ["A series losing steam, and it's a real shame given the potential of the first two books--both fun, quick reads. This title is less focused on the sci-fi and philosophical underpinnings of the first two books. Instead, Adams here maintains sequences that hinge on bizarre chains of events and silly, ponderous exchanges between characters who have less and less of an idea as to what exactly is happening around them. These felt a long 200+ pages indeed.The bon mots and clever passages are fewer and further between than the previous two installments. In fact, much of this book is rather uninspired and infuriating; the Krikkit robots, the Bistromathematics, the reincarnations of the hapless multiple-murder victim Agrajag... none of the set pieces gave me more than a brief chuckle. Much of what aims to pass for characteristic Adams whimsy feels perfunctory, and the string of coincidences that form the crux of the plot are truly slapdash.The highlights for me here are Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged's perpetual misanthropy and what amounts to the only real meat of the book--the story of the reason why the ultimate question and answer of the universe are (putatively) mutually exclusive. Thus leading to \"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\". But nothing here matches the humor of, for instance, the truly inspired chapter containing the Hitchhiker's Guide's entry on The Universe in \"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\".When Adams is working with less inspired ideas, his inability to write characters as anything but vehicles for punchlines and guttural confusions is trying. Vonnegut, while a weak painter of convincing personalities, instills a sense of humanity and pathos in the proceedings that eludes Adams. Some sense of feeling and sympathy, perhaps, plays foil to the general absurdity of exposition and content in Vonnegut. This is why he's a better read if you're comparing the two as I feel prone to do, and one of several reasons I'm not too concerned with making it through last installments in this series.All of that being said, I have to say that the ending is pretty simpatico with me. Maybe Adams should have left it all at that."], ["I'm feeling some series fatigue after binge-reading this and the second book over the weekend. I don't know if this was indeed a weaker/more confusing volume or was it just the fact that too much of a good thing can sometimes be bad. Either way, I had some difficulty finishing it and I think I won't be reading the 4th and 5th book anytime soon. It gets 3 stars (2,5 actually) because despite it being really confusing and at time frustrating, it still had a lot of fun and hilarious moments."], ["this is the last book in the series that I really enjoyed and I almost wish Douglas Adams would have called it quits here. The book gives us the chance to laugh at ourselves in going back to prehistoric earth and Adams alternate view of how we ended up the creatures we are, that was extremely clever.But Krikkit was the best part, this story was amazing and I can't help but wonder if Adams religous views are at work here. A group of people that just can't accept the idea that there might be another group of people besides them in the universe, and the only way they can deal with it is to kill anyone who is not them.But the time paradox starts to become a real problem at this point and utterly undoes the series from here out, and the fact that the cast of characters spends most of their time split apart and that is not as much fun. Also, the characters flaws have become exagerrated by this time and the things that made them interesting characters but people you wouldn't want to know, has now made all of them a little annoying."], ["As a continuation of Douglas Adams' famous The Hitchiker's Guide Series this was, as indicated by the foreword, one of the most plotted in the series. But as also indicated by the foreword, you don't read The Hitchiker's Guide Series for the plots. So, you ask me, what do you read it for? You read it for the sense of wonder about the crazy place the universe is. You read it for the comedy of Douglas Adams, for his creative and zany use of made up people, places, words...for his use of language. He is a wizard, transforming words into wit to power a laugh within the inner sanctum of your mind as a reader. When you think you've got him figured out, that's when you realise that actually you haven't.I read elsewhere when attempting to discover what I could about the literary idea of 'deus-ex-machina' that while it is generally frowned upon as poor storytelling that Adams was able to use it brilliantly for humour. Reading this third instalment of his series I saw again that yes, he was able to do exactly that! And at the same time his use of deus-ex-machina also contributes ultimately to the plot (which we as readers of Adams do not care for). In many ways, perhaps unintentionally, Adams therefore shows that he can also use the literary device of 'Chekhov's gun'. Characters and plot ideas introduced earlier in the piece never really go away. Some may be simple ideas thrown in their for an occasional laugh, but if you see Adams mention a fact or a character specifically, especially in a way that's out of the story's usual context then that character or fact will appear later. Such as the idea in this story of flying (and the re-incarnated character - which I thought was brilliant!).I won't bother with a plot summary. I doubt anyone can sum up the plot in any way that makes much sense. I will say that if you've read the previous books and enjoyed them then this is a similar continuation.

Alas, despite my high hopes going in, that's exactly what it is. To start with, there are the small issues, such as the fact that, having been written in 2005, most of the content and especially tone of this book is hopelessly dated by today's standards - anything bitching about the Bush administration is just hopelessly passe these days, and the fact that the author didn't like the bullshit-laden cynicism of that administration seems to be pretty much the entire point of this book, at a time when such sentiments were hardly unique. With the exception of a few mildly interesting \"organization of knowledge\" type ideas about the nature of bullshit in the first few pages, there isn't a single thought in this book that someone else hadn't already thought of by 2005. This would be fine if not for Penny's annoying habit of turning every. single. sentence. into a series of rhetorical flourishes in a tone that screams \"look at how clever and edgy I am\", but mostly just succeeds in conveying that she's trying too hard to be clever and edgy. This makes her writing not only difficult to scan but tiresome to actually read. I would've been willing to forgive this transgression, though, if not for the much larger issue that Penny makes no effort whatsoever to be anything but derivative of all of the other anti-Bush screeds circulating at the time, or to actually show that she is capable of using her education in any way other than appealing to that laziest common denominator of Bush-era liberal discontent. Absolutely no attempt is made at any time to cite any actual facts or to make any original contribution beyond the first few pages. It should therefore come as no surprise that Penny's argument is riddled with factual errors. At first, it's just minor, annoying things such as referring to her disdain for commercials featuring a nonexistent SUV called the \"Chevrolet Tacoma\", but as the book goes on she starts misquoting history in ways that undermine her argument (e.g. misidentifying both Jamestown and New England as being essentially corporate constructions from the beginning, when New England was no such thing.) and assuming that the reader has never heard of and apparently will never hear of James Comey, who as of this writing is head of the FBI. [May 2017 update: No one will ever hear of James Comey? Never ever? Hoo boy...]If Penny had made errors like this once or twice it would be forgivable, but she does it so often that it undermines her credibility, since mostly these are errors that would require about a minute of Google time in order to fix. Dude, if Al Franken could cite his sources for the anti-Bush screeds he produced during this period, so can you. That this sort of shoddy, mass-produced work should appear in a one-dimensional liberal screed about how shoddy and mass-produced our culture has become is as ironic as it is sad, because it doesn't challenge the premise that even our \"intellectual\" polemics in opposition to mass-produced bullshit have to be mass-produced bullshit in and of themselves. Despite its initial intentions, this book is ultimately a product of the very same corporate profiteering and societal attention span issues that Penny herself is railing against. It exists not because Penny is a brilliant, or even coherent author, but simply because there was a market for this sort of writing in 2005, so someone published it to cash in, seeing the potential market of 59,028,444 (John Kerry's share of the 2004 electorate) US citizens alone who were dissatisfied with the then-present administration. Penny's failure to recognize this, as well as the unfortunately dated nature of many of these observations, is really what makes this book so insufferable. It also explains why, when I bought this book shortly after Obama took office, it was out of a stack of about two dozen remainders. It's a shame, because there are some good ideas recycled here, and even a handful of entertaining witticisms, but ultimately this is just not a book that will appeal to most people this far after the fact, at least if you want anything more than superficial affirmation that your dislike of George W.

The thing is that Penny doesn't actually say anything new in this book, and does not really point out anything that we don't already know, and there are much better books out there that do just that (such as Naomi Klein's No Logo).\tThe thing about the corporation is that there are two sides to every issue. Corporations are able to raise huge amounts of capital to be able to produce things that normal people like us are not able. They are also able to make life easier and to provide avenues for us to be able to get things that we like and need. Without the corporation we would not have supermarkets, or multiplex cinemas, or even the vehicle to get you to these places.\tOn the flip side, they have what is effectively unfettered power of control. Corporations control what we see and what we do. With the amount of money they are able to raise they are able to influence governments and elections. We have seen this recently in Australia where one media company pretty much dictated the election result by printing newspaper articles with views that they wanted people to see. For instance, opposition leader was pictured as the saviour that Australia needed while every move that the government made was plastered everywhere, and was given a negative twist (while this has been the case for a long time with elections, it has never been to this extent previously in Australia). Now, what we have is a government that is effectively secret and media shy, and bowing to corporate interests for what they believe is in the best interests of the country.\tThere is one thing that I have noticed that is coming out of this recent election and that is a law banning boycotts. This law is clearly aimed at promoting and protecting corporate interests and denying the citizens of Australia the right to freedom of speech. The question is how is this law going to be implemented. Am I going to be forced to eat at McDonalds, and am I going to be forced to do all of my shopping at one of the major supermarkets because if I don't it will be considered a boycott. Or is this law going to fall flat on its face because there is no way to actually determine whether a consumer's buying behaviour is a boycott or simply choice.\tAnother thing this book raises is the idea of the phone maze. I work in a glorified call center (meaning that we need to have decent training to be able to work where we are working) and the idea of the phone maze is to try and direct us to where we want to go. With the number of calls I make out, I encounter either the switchboard, or the phone maze. Having navigated lots of phone mazes, one becomes proficient in getting to where you want to go, or at least working out how to speak to a person because a computer simply has no intelligence and only responds to commands. Otherwise you hit the switchboard which, unless you are ultra-specific, they end up sending you to the wrong department anyway.\tOne thing that I notice in my workplace is how people are being forced to specialise. The work duties are slowly being narrowed down in the same way that the manufacturing sector has narrowed down the tasks that the workers perform. Before the industrial revolution, blacksmiths used to be multi-skilled, however now all you do is the same repetitive task day in and day out. The same is the case with office work, and with file management, as the specific tasks on each file are farmed out to specialists.

I read this book \"way back when\". I probably read it first when I was in high school or just after. That would probably be the 1960s. I went through a period when I discovered Heinlein and ran through everything I could get my hands on by him. Some I didn't care for, some I liked and some I loved.Many people place this in his so called \"teen reads\" but there is some question about that due to some of the subject matter. Heinlein was very much a libertarian and had very open ideas about most things. This includes sex. Among some there's a bit of, consternation concerning the \"final love interest\" in the book.Just try it yourself and decide for yourself.Daniel Boone Davis (many of Heinlein's protagonists have names hearkening back to American history) is a master engineer and inventor...and that's what he wants to do. In the story which is placed in the \"near future\" (1970)...among other things in this \"near future\" people are able to take cold sleep. They can be frozen and awakened months or years later.Now, if I go any further in this synopsis it will involve spoilers so I'll simply suggest you try the book if for some reason you have managed to miss it. There's something here for hard science fiction fans, science fantasy fans, animal lovers (particularly cat lovers), and fans of just plain good books. I can and do recommend this one. Enjoy."], ["An enjoyable SF story from a Grandmaster.The novel's protagonist, Daniel B. Davis, was a precursor to Hugh Farnham and even Lazarus Long somewhat, though Long was introduced earlier in 1941's Methusaleh's Children. Actually, Davis (and others) are thinly disguised Heinlein: fiercely individualist, libertarian, technically savvy, hard working yet innovative, resourceful, wise cracking, and with a horn dog libido that would make a porn star blush. I wonder if Door Into Summer used some of the same notes and ideas that would later surface in Time Enough for Love? Door into Summer may be classified as a transitional book between the earlier juvenile works and his middle works (his apex, his high water mark) and then to the weird, time traveling and lusty later books. I think a better reviewer than me could even make the point that Heinlein had begun his ascendancy here."], ["I liked it, but it was suggested to me I shouldn't give four stars to every single book I enjoy, so here it goes for Heinlein. I really had no issues with \"The Door Into Summer\", and Heinlein is still one of my favorite SF masters after this.I enjoy books that feature engineers as protagonists, and here we have one proto-geek singlehandedly inventing robotics in the 50's and failing rather spectacularly in the human relations department. Later on, there's some time travel thrown in and some cryogenics, giving us a glimpse of what the year 2000 would look like to a 1950 citizen. It's interesting to note how we surpassed some of Heinlein expectations in the field of artificial intelligence and miniaturization, and still didn't invent regenerating teeth, disposable shirts or beard removal cream. There's something very similar to velcro replacing zippers, but with a rather fancy field energy source.Heinlein prose is clean and fast, without his sometime annoying preaching and with some quality humor, courtesy of Petronius the Arbiter. Some of his sexual liberation stuff is included, like a nudist camp or an engagement with an 11 year old, but it doesn't take a central role to the story.[edit for spelling 2015]"], ["Well after many thousands of ratings this book is averaging 4 stars so my rating will make no difference at all. I first read this back in the late 70s, and like most of Heinlein's early and middle work I really enjoyed it then and again now. The storyline and characterisations are good and there is none of the (in my opinion) vague sexism and verbal meanderings of his later books (look how many pages his later novels have, yawn).Ok I've just re-read my review and whilst I thoroughly enjoyed the book, Heinlein must've been a cat lover as he had Petronius exactly right, maybe I was a tad harsh on some of his later books. I just found them very introspective and self indulgent, and much as I enjoy Heinlein books I think I gave up after fighting my way through \"Time Enough For Love\". I don't think I've read anything written after that. Yes, that sounds fairer :)"], ["I really enjoyed this book from beginning to [almost] end. The reason for the \"almost\" will become apparent. The story of time travel by various means was excellent. When reading this story, you should remember that it was written in the 1950s. Some of Heinlein's predictions are amazing, and some are way off the mark. It's amazing to follow his line of thinking though.You can see an outline of the plot in the description. It is fairly predictable, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story at all. It was fun, and it was refreshing to read such innocent prose.Although some people might be offended, there was some narrative that would be considered non-PC these days, but was just part of life in the 'fifties. I actually found that quite refreshing too. I get so irritated by the over-sensitivity to political correctness these days. You can't even tell a good Irish joke, or drop your pants in a US bar to proudly show off your British tattoo, these days, without drawing comments from the puritans.The story was great right up until the final chapter. This was a bit of a damp squib, Heinlein felt that his hero had to justify and explain his actions and how several instances of himself could coexist. I would have been far more satisfied with the explosive ending which could so easily have been there.Having said that, I would strongly recommend this book to all lovers of time travel and sci-fi books."], ["I didn't read this book with the intention of writing a review, so you'll excuse me if I don't go into great detail. Let me just summarize \"the feel\" of the book...It is not very often that I read a book that makes me smile the entire time I'm reading it; this is one of them. From the hilarious anachronisms of the 1950's Futurist to the brilliant side-kick cat, Pete. (Cat lovers will appreciate this book on a completely different level than other readers). I was laughing out loud at least once every 20 pages or so.It is only because I read some of the other reviews for this book that I felt the need to write a review myself. After seeing that a number of reviews that charge The Door into Summer (and sometimes Heinlein himself) as being both misogynistic and perverse, I felt the need to defend it (and him).First of all, on the complaints that Heinlein's vision of the future (from 1956, remember) is sexist, misogynistic, anti-woman, etc.:There are not many women in this story, true enough, which may be a mark against it in and of itself. Because of this, the heinous Belle stands out as being a particularly unlikable femme-fatale. Though I would argue that, had Belle not been foiled by Dan's foray into time travel, her plot would have succeeded and she would have made a respectable villain. She was well-equipped for it: calculating, edgy, violent, and un-emotional. But because the other women in the book (Jenny Sutton, the Girl-Scout Matron, and later Ricki) are fairly minor they do little to offset the influence of Belle and rather support the 1950's housewife stereotype. And Dan Davis' engineering vision of rescuing women from the drudgery of housework is a little dated, to be sure.However, I consider these to be the faults of a novel written in the 1950's. I always find it best to approach a book with the understanding that it is a product of the time in which it was written. If a novel breaks through the conventions of its time, great! But it would be unreasonable to expect it every time one picks up a new book. Our modern sensibilities might be offended by some archaic ideas, but out-dated notions don't necessarily devalue an otherwise good yarn. (not to mention historically important works)It's true that science fiction often pushes boundaries: of politics, religion, war, gender, sexuality, human nature, etc. But it is not necessary. And it is certainly not necessary to push all of them at once. The Door into Summer is not a book about gender roles. It reflects opinions common to the time in which it was written, but it does not address them specifically. It cannot be said to be particularly forward thinking on the subject, but at the same time it is a passive position. Heinlein is not actively or purposefully oppressing women in this novel, but he is describing a world very similar to the one in which he lived. Which, for me, is enough that I didn't hate the novel for its faults.Heinlein has shown in this and other novels that he is not rigid in his notions on the future of gender roles. In Starship Troopers women make the best fighter pilots because of their superior reflexes and mental dexterity. In this novel, there are suggestions that--outside of the narrative--women are fulfilling more diverse roles than we see them in. Dan Davis, when discussing the merits of his engineering robot 'Drafting Dan', admits that most women don't care much for it unless they are engineers themselves! The offhand nature of this remark is indicative that it is not an alien idea to Dan. Perhaps his housekeeping robot is more liberal-minded than we initially supposed, if it has freed women from the role of housewives to pursue their dreams outside the home. Something to consider, anyways.With that out of the way, I wanted to talk about the so-called perversion of Dan's unconventional (temporally speaking) romance with Ricki. Many people have commented on the \"disturbing\" nature of the love story sub-plot. And maybe it's because I've recently read Lolita, but I really didn't feel too put out about it. I actually found Dan and Ricki's relationship kind of cute, mostly because Dan falls in love with Ricki because she understands and appreciates his cat--which Dan feels is indicative of the kind of person she is (although she is only a child). It is important to note that there are no overtly pedophilic suggestions in this book, unless the reader supplies them (I'm sure there are those who will disagree)When it comes down to it, Dan's romantic feelings towards Ricki are not directed at her juvenile self but at the woman he imagines she will become. It is not unusual, I think, to idealize and idolize romantically (particularly after one has had ones heart broken). Ricki is the only female that Dan has ever felt any connection with, and he values her friendship. It is only after Belle betrays him that he begins to think \"if only Ricki were older\". Not because he fantasizes about being with a child (obviously, he wouldn't then wish she were older) but because he fantasizes about being with someone he loves and trusts.He cannot even be said to be taking advantage of her childish crush on him. He tells Ricki to wait until she's 20 to decide if she wants to be with him (he is, and will remain, 30). Ricki has 8 sobering years to decide if she still has feelings for Dan once she is an adult, during which he can supply no pressure. Thanks to the invention of suspended animation their love is possible without being creepy!Ok, so that's a longer rant than I intended. But there it is. Thanks for bearing with me if you got this far!"], ["Somewhat unusually for Heinlein, this is a cute, fun book which doesn't try to ladle a bunch of right-wing ideology down your throat, or O.D. you on dubious sex. There's some time travel, a sympathetic main character, a Bad Girl, and a cat who steals the show every time he appears on stage. He even gets the title: the reference is to his endearing habit, during winter months, of making the hero open each door in the house in turn, just in case one of them happens to lead into summer..."], ["Are you a cat person? If yes, you\u2019re definitely in for a treat. Pete is an amazingly written cat character if there ever was one. Yes, cat lovers will surely appreciate this one. Cat owners will understand that cats like Pete are as rare as true love and only come once in a life time, if we\u2019re lucky, hence they will understand what makes Pete so special to Dan, his owner. However, even if you happen to hate cats, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll appreciate the ingenious way Pete is described. That\u2019s just plain good writing. I\u2019m making it sound like this is a novel about cat. Well, it\u2019s not but it sorts of is. The cat I\u2019m talking about is an important character, not in any futuristic genetically altered pet sense of the world, he just happens to be a side kick of our protagonist. Who might that be? Our protagonist is Dan Davis, an engineer, a well written characters, one could say a typical Heinlein hero. You know, a very intelligent badass guy who is on to take on the world and won\u2019t let anything stops him. He is charming yet bold, brave but thoughtful, no fool but willing to take calculated risks.Nevertheless, this isn\u2019t exactly how he starts out! When the novel opens, he is not up to much. The novel opens with our guy drinking himself to death on account of his best friend and his ex-finance tricking him out of his invention (and hard earned future glory as well as financial security). So, he is a bit depressed. The only person he cares for in this world is Ricky, who happens to be a ten-year-old daughter of his late friend. He respects her and we suppose he imagines she might be a good companion someday because he decided to freeze himself so that they can be together in ten years\u2019 time. Some people find this part to be quite disturbing, but it isn\u2019t like he wants to be with her when she\u2019s a kid, he is romantically interested in the women she will be once she grows up. There is no knowing who that will be, you might say and yes that would be a valid point but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother our protagonist. If Pete likes her, the girl must be ok and will stay that way (maybe Dan believes in cat\u2019s intuition). I would say there is nothing fishy in the relationship between Dan and Ricky, but I can see why some might consider it to be a bit weird. Why the need to freeze himself up in the first place? He could have waited for her to grow up, but that sounds creepy doesn\u2019t it? To watch someone growing up and then to marry them? Way creepier than just freezing yourself up and meeting them in the future? Actually yes.It is interesting that he wants this relationship to happen when they\u2019re about the same age. Does that indicate that he actually thinks there is something wrong in relationships in which there exists a significant age difference? Or more likely he needs the freezing up part to make the story more interesting? I mean this is a SF novel and we\u2019re all waiting for the story to become well more SF. Furthermore, you know Dan is not motivated just by the desire to be with the future grown up Ricky. There isn\u2019t much talk about Ricky if you think about it, this isn\u2019t Lolita. There is not much talk about his feelings at that point and that\u2019s not going to change drastically. Don\u2019t expect him to get all emotional, it is not going to happen. This avoidance of emotional talk (or perhaps even thoughts) may be due to the fact that Dan makes that freezing himself up decision after a long period of drinking. It may be that his true feelings for Ricky only develop later on. At any rate, she isn\u2019t the sole motivation.Dan wants revenge. He wants to rub it into the face of his ex. He wants to be young when she is old. Perhaps most importantly, he wants to live in the future. He is an engineer you know. He is wondering what the world will look like in a number of years. Speaking of which, it is fascinating to observe how correct or how wrong Heinlein\u2019s predictions were. There is certainly a lot of talk about the future in this one. Moreover, there is the actual \u2018future\u2019 experienced by a man from another time epoch and you can trust in one of the greats of SF to make that part good. It does get more interesting because things don\u2019t go as planned, I mean the freezing up and all. When he wakes up in the future, he starts seeing things he is sure he had himself invented. As he said, every engineer has his own signature and it is this signature he is seeing everywhere that is driving him crazy.Enters time travel. You know a book about just being frozen wasn\u2019t going to cut it. He needs to travel back in time. There needs to be more action. Not surprisingly, that is what we get. More action and adventure. No complains here. You know I\u2019m not even sure if women play an important part in this novel. Perhaps not really. We have one typical femme-fatale and one angelic girl, but the relationships with them are never explored into great detail. As far as relationships are concerned, this is more about the love between a man and his cat then about love between a man and a woman. Just for a record, I don\u2019t have a problem with that. Not everything has to be all romantic and stuff.There is certainly a way to read the story between Dan and Ricky that makes it all sweet and romantic, but I think Ricky is there mostly for the plot. This is a one-man show or more precisely one man and his cat show! Romance isn\u2019t a fundamental part of it, but it doesn\u2019t feel out of place either. As I said, the relationship between Dan and Ricky can be read in a very sweet light (or in a slightly creepy one) \u2026or it can be just ignored, if that isn\u2019t your thing.  The Door into Summer is a very good SF novel that is mostly about adventure, time travel, engineering, future predictions, action, being badass and all those things we love about Heinlein. It is interesting enough to keep us intellectually stimulated and there is a touch of emotion that is just enough. I really enjoyed reading it. I have a copy at home, so I\u2019ll probably reread it again eventually (emphasis on again because I already reread it). I recommend this to engineers, Heinlein\u2019s fans, cat\u2019s lovers, readers of SF as well as those interested in time travel stories. This is a fabulously written SF novel, pretty short but filled with such lovely things! The protagonist is and awfully charming and smart guy and it is great fun reading about his adventures. If you want to read a novel with a guy that makes it against all odds, this is the novel for you.Final words? The Door Into Summer is a highly enjoyable read. It is not Heinlein\u2019s best, but it is a very good novel. It found it to be incredibly uplifting and fun. In addition, this novel managed to accomplish what many great works of literature have tried but failed and that is describe perfectly an infinitely complex creature called....the cat."], ["** spoiler alert **\n           Ultimately, creepy, and not in a good way. It's a time travel tale, and I'll forgive a lot for an entertaining time travel story. But \"entertaining\" and \"time travel\" are all it's got going for it. I haven't read a lot of Heinlein, but this didn't show me at all why he's got got so many fans. The writing style is fine, but he goes wrong in a few key ways with the story. [SPOILERS] For one, he wrote the book in 1956, with most characters' natural time being 1970 and the rest of the action (reached cryogenically and returned from via time travel) being in 2000 and 2001. Both are full of technological, cultural, and historical differences Heinlein invented. These probably seemed cool in 1957 or 1960, but his 2000 here wouldn't have held up in 1985, let alone 2008. Spoiling with age as badly as his inaccurate visions of change is his vision of something wholly unchanged over 50 years: a degree of sexism astonishing these days. Hell, I suspect his degree of sexism would have been startling even in the real 1970. It's not constant and overpowering; it's just striking.Each of those would be flaws I wouldn't mind having to overlook for the sake of the time travel story, which is largely entertaining, but Heinlein completely undermines any satisfaction that could come from it by having the protagonist and narrator, Dan Davis, eagerly find a way (via the rampant cryogenics of imaginary 1970) to marry in 2000 the step-daughter of his business partner, a girl who, as a child called him \"Uncle Danny.\" He'd known her since she was a toddler or something (in 1970, she's nine and he's [always] thirty), and there's talk early in the book about how she had a crush on him and wanted to marry him when she grew up, but it's just some misplaced childhood crush and, of course, nothing he actually reciprocates. Supposedly. Ultimately, though, after all the time travel stuff (which you could totally separate pretty easily from this weirdness), during which he makes various occasional references to how great this kid is and how important she is to him, after he returns from 2000 (during which time he never met her as an adult) to 1970 and takes care of fun paradox stuff, he tells her that he's going to go into thirty-year cryostasis. (Again, though no one but he knows it's his 2nd time.) 30 years seems like forever to a young kid, and she's upset she won't see him again, and he tells her that in 1982, when she's 21, she could do \"The Long Sleep\" too and come out of it also in 2000. She asks, \"If I do...will you marry me?\" He replies, damn disturbingly, \"Yes....That's what I want. That's why I'm doing this.\" After they awake in 2000, they get married pretty much immediately. And then the book ends within a few pages.So Heinlein's a freak and a perv. I don't care that much that this girl is physically 21 when they hook up. The \"hero\" never knew her as an adult, just as a young kid who called him \"Uncle Danny,\" and it was based on that relationship that he decided he wanted to marry her. Also, the 21-year-old who opted for the cryogenics in 1982 apparently still has the precise same feelings as her nine-year-old self, which is similarly disturbing. Goddamn. Fricking. Creepy. Throughout the book, the protagonist (and narrator) doesn't seem like a really great guy but sympathetic enough. If Heinlein's trying to blow the reader's mind by having him turn out to be not at all sympathetic after all that, I could see the point in that. But there's no indication that's what the author's up to or, indeed, that he sees anything wrong here. It seems instead that he's glad for Dan to have a happy ending. Parents of 1957, keep your children away from Robert Heinlein, please.My default tendency is to react favorably to time travel fiction, so it's pretty striking to make that U-turn from amusement to revulsion there at the end and move this from the \"OK\" column into \"Not OK. Not.\""], ["Another old favorite picked up as a downloadable audio book from the library. It was quite enjoyable in this medium & the reader was very good. Originally published in 1957, it is set in 'the future' years 1970 & 2000. The idea of traveling into the future via 'cold sleep' was a pretty popular until sometime in the 70's, but cutting edge at this time, I think. Haven't heard about it in humans for years.The hero, Dan, is an engineer & inventor. His genius isn't in break through technology, but in putting together mostly off-the-shelf parts to create really useful laborsaving devices. Steve Jobs type genius, timing, & design. Heinlein's discussion of this tech timing over the course of the book is very practical & interesting. It's amazing how much supporting technology there has to be for every major breakthrough.Engineering is the art of the practical and depends more on the total state of the art than it does on the individual engineer. When railroading time comes you can railroad-but not before. Look at poor Professor Langley, breaking his heart on a flying machine that should have flown-he had put the necessary genius in it-but he was just a few years too early to enjoy the benefit of collateral art he needed and did not have. Or take the great Leonardo daVinci, so far out of his time that his most brilliant concepts were utterly unbuildable.It was Heinlein's genius to take this a step further into the prosaic & make it sound so easy & obvious.Amazingly little real thought had been given to housework, even though it is at least 50 per cent of all work in the world. The women's magazines talked about \"labor saving in the home\" and \"functional kitchens,\" but it was just prattle; their pretty pictures showed living-working arrangements essentially no better than those in Shakespeare's day; the horse-to-jet-plane revolution had not reached the home.Of course, Heinlein got a lot wrong about the future, but that wasn't too bad. Most obviously, we still don't have most of the devices that he describes. I loved his idea of Thorsen Memory tubes & macro programming, even though both are silly & simplistic. He had helicopter buses & completely missed the idea of the Internet - overall communications or electronic databases - yet he had transmutation of elements. Not a bad reason, if incorrect, for getting off the gold standard & he had the timing pretty close.The overall story was a pretty good one of love & betrayal. With the time travel tossed in, it got quite twisty - although I was a little disappointed the he seemed to try to obscure it a bit too much especially in the last conversation. That was too much as the character is supposed to be fairly intelligent. And that brings me to the creep factor that really brings the book down for me - Dan's relationship with Ricky. (view spoiler)[ What do you call a guy who promises to marry a 10 year old when she grows up & then does it without even knowing her as an adult? Seriously, he did & the scene was so poorly done, too. Ricky talks like the little girl she is yet Dan treats her like the full grown woman she will be. It was seriously icky. (hide spoiler)]So it was a 4 star story with 1 star removed due to this one creepy factor. It's well worth reading or listening too, though.

Sometimes, the plot is as much of a mystery, too, but I don't care. :) After the rising of new gods in Asgard and the fate of soooo many pebbles, and the dark, dark fate of a Coke machine, who really cares? The novel is brilliant and creative and so darkly funny. It's enough to make me despair for modern literature, and this came out in '88! Here's another awesome tidbit. It's the novel that I first thought of when I first read American Gods. All the greatness of seeing Odin on the page or Thor blowing up an airport is all here and the characterizations are brilliant. Can I even say that it's even more brilliant after knowing the legends much better? You bet I can! I read this when I was 14 years old the first time and let's be frank... I didn't know crap. I learned most of what I knew about Thor from this book and the fact that there was some silly Marvel comic that I wasn't even tempted to read was about it. And now? Soooooo Nice! :) Even the little In-Jokes about the gods are all here. It's a bit more erudite than I expected it to be. :)But it's also so funny! Do I love eagles even more now? You bet! Am I even more annoyed with Yuppies? You bet! Do I want to run out and get some 300 count sheets and snuggle in them, perhaps get an eyepatch and avoid big strapping men with hammers? You bet!Poor Dirk. I have to admit that his Horoscope is always dead-on. :)My one complaint is that there wasn't a whole series made out of this. I still wonder just how amazingly cool it could have been to have a full bookcase full of these and point to it as the most amazing thing EVAH.*sigh*Some authors just overflow with goodness. Douglas Adams was one of them. *sigh*"], ["This is the second book about Dirk Gently, the holistic private investigator. A seriously underestimated series (or what was to become a series, I'm sure).In this second volume, Dirk is not really at his best. Something is wrong and he can't put his finger to it. To make matters worse, a very well off client, who promised to voluntarily pay for all sorts of quirks, is not just crazy as Dirk had thought, but ends up dead (money sure does seem to have a way of getting away from Dirk). Dirk's horoscope is even worse than usual but instead of taking the holistic approach, he chalks it up to an acquaintance of his being even more annoying than usual (that acquaintance is writing that particular horoscope). Add to that a weird incident at Heathrow airport (it had it coming if you ask me, I hate that place) and several encounters with fridges and a Coca-Cola vending machine and you get the usual silliness for which Douglas Adams was so famous for.However, as is also signature DA, no matter how silly his characters or observations, they are also spot on. Like how airports are the worst places on Earth and how everyone is aggravated there. Or how the simplest things we're used to can seem paramount when living somewhere this simple thing isn't normal and certainly not simple (yes, I'm talking about the pizza deliveries - Paul, is it true that London doesn't have (or didn't have, in the 80s?) pizza delivering services, but that you have (had?) to pick the pizza up yourself instead?).Throughout the book there are hilarious moments, classics of the comedy genre. Like when Kate is at Heathrow in the very beginning. Or when (view spoiler)[the eagle is in Dirk's office/apartment, he locks it in the kitchen, it repeatedly flies against the kitchen door in order to get out, then Dirk opens the door, the eagle doesn't notice in time and instead slams into the wall of the next room (hide spoiler)]. Or how Kate often gets revenge for not having a pizza delivery service in London. In fact, her interaction with (view spoiler)[Thor (hide spoiler)] in general. Or how Dirk gets his Jaguar from the mechanic (see below). Or how (view spoiler)[a certain couple got what they had coming (hide spoiler)] at the very end of the book. I was once again involuntarily attracting a lot of attention on my commute home when I burst out laughing on several occasions.Here, for those who already know the book or want to laugh but not read the book (*gasps* shame on you all!):He did at last understand that the mechanic was also claiming that a family of starlings had at some point in the past made their nest in a sensitive part of the engine's workings and had subsequently perished horribly, taking sensitive parts of the engine with them, and at this point Dirk began to cast about himself desperately for what to do.He noticed that the mechanic's pick-up truck was standing nearby with its engine still running, and elected to make off with this instead. Being a slightly less slow and cumbersome runner than the mechanic he was able to put this plan into operation with a minimum of difficulty.He swung out into the lane, drove off into the night and parked three miles down the road. He left the van's lights on, let down its tyres, and hid himself behind a tree. After about ten minutes his Jaguar came hurtling round the corner, passed the van, hauled itself to an abrupt halt and reversed wildly back towards it. The mechanic threw open the door, leapt out and hurried over to reclaim his property, leaving Dirk with the opportunity he needed to leap from behind the tree and reclaim his own. He spun his wheels pointedly and drove off in a kind of grim triumph, ...Or this little gem:An \"Act of God\". Merely a chance, careless phrase by which people were able to dispose conveniently of awkward phenomena that would admit of no more rational explanation. But it was the chance carelessness of it which particularly appealed to Dirk because words used carelessly, as if they did not matter in any serious way, often allowed otherwise well-guarded truths to seep through.One thing was scary: the lawyer? The whole time I read the speech he gave Dirk I kept hearing Donald Trump (you know, the pronunciation, the repetition, \"the greatest\", ...)!Nevertheless, despite such golden moments of comedy and the fact that (view spoiler)[Norse gods (my second favourite canon) (hide spoiler)] were in this, I didn't love this as much as the first book. Maybe it was because Dirk wasn't on top of his game and I kept screaming at him internally that he had already noticed the significant bits, just subconsciously. Or because although there were sharp observations in this as well, they weren't as sharp or as numerous as in the first book. I don't know. However, those are also very strong emotions the book invoked and the writing style was once again top notch and very engaging, the characters all quirky and realistic though (or especially because) extremely whacky.Before writing this review, I intended to \"only\" give this 4 stars to mark the difference between this and the previous volume. However, now that I've gathered my thoughts for this review, I think that would be an injustice - the first one was perfection from start to finish, this one was \"only\" but still excellent after all. Thus, I'm giving it 5 stars yet again, because I'm a solid Douglas Adams fangirl now and it is clear that I love Dirk Gently and am thoroughly saddened by how soon the series has had to come to an end. I'll definitely finish this up by also reading the \"3rd\" (actually just a collection of what Douglas Adams had prepared for a third novel plus some other bits and pieces he might have turned into books had he not died much too soon)."], ["Unlike his \u201cHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d series (a collection of humorous vignettes without much of a plot, continuity, or character development), Douglas Adams\u2019 Dirk Gently series (two novels and some sketches for a third one, included in the \u201cSalmon of Doubt\u201d) is in fact literature of the first degree. In the second novel, \u201cThe Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul,\u201d Dirk Gently, a private \u201cholistic\u201d investigator (an eccentric slob, perpetually broke, capricious, silly, and wonderfully insightful), while minding his client\u2019s (Kate, a somewhat confused gal from New York) interests, unravels a pseudo-conspiracy involving the Norse gods (all of them), in which the gods are the victims.Employing his own special methods (which differ from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 methods in that Dirk has a soft spot for the impossible and does not like to dismiss it), Dirk manages to a) side with the gods b) save them c) punish the guilty d) help his client e) end up broke again. The last bit is fine by him (in the previous novel, he sent a bill to a client of his, whose missing cat he was supposed to find, with just one item on it, \u201cSaving the Universe. No charge\u201d).Laced with Adams\u2019 trademark humor, this novel certainly puts its author in the same category with Mark Twain, Chekhov, and Maupassant. I\u2019m not exaggerating."], ["This used to be one of my favorite books when I was 18 (that was more than a few years ago *cough* thirty something *cough*). I was definitely going through a \u2018I love everything Douglas Adams\u2019 phase at the time and while I still like this book because sometimes the ridiculousness of the plot and randomness of how everything happens is still so much fun I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I did back then.There are some great things in this. There is Dirk who is a funny and severely quirky character who is often very creative in his role as a holistic detective. I really do laugh at the odd way in which he sees the world and interacts with it. \n\u201cHe had a tremendous propensity for getting lost when driving. This was largely because of his method of \u201cZen\u201d navigation, which was simply to find any car that looked as if it knew where it was going and follow it. The results were more often surprising than successful, but he felt it was worth it for the sake of the few occasions when it was both.\u201d \u201cWhen the girl sitting at the next table looked away for a moment, Dirk leaned over and took her coffee. He knew that he was perfectly safe doing this because she would simply not be able to believe that this had happened. He sat sipping at the lukewarm cup and casting his mind back over the day.\u201d \nWhile if I met him in real life I\u2019d probably like to deck him, in the story I find his antics and musings completely fascinating and sometimes hilarious.Some of the story seemed more like just random events to me this time through and while situationally funny I wasn\u2019t sure how it all moved together sometimes. Thor having performance issues was entertaining as was Kate trying to figure out why right after she left the ticketing gate at Heathrow Airport did it blow un and what is with all the penguins in her subconscious.\n\u201cInsofar as she recognized at all that she was dreaming, she realized that she must be exploring her subconscious mind. She had heard it said that humans are supposed only to use about a tenth of their brains, and that no one was really clear what the other nine tenths were for, but she had certainly never heard it suggested that they were used for storing penguins.\u201d\nAdams wrote some wonderful jokes throughout the story but now that I\u2019ve read so many more books I see where there are some real pacing problems and the actual story is a bit lackluster overall, but the jokes are great.Even though this isn\u2019t as great as I once remembered it being I still so love to dive into this type of humor from time to time and just give into the improbability and impossibility of it all."], ["20,000 ratings, 500 reviews? Why bother to add another one to the masses? You don't need me to tell you to read this book, if you've gotten this far you're either already a fan of Adams or like me you picked it up because of the moody title and should have now found out that it's a sequel to the original Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. Fear not, you don't really need to have read the other one to enjoy this additional piece of absurdity from Douglas Adams. Instead I'll make five points about the second Dirk Gently if I may.1. I've read this book more than any other Douglas Adams book.2. This is my good friend Emily's favourite ever book; she loves it so much that she judges people by whether they have it on their bookshelf or not, whether they've even read it and most importantly how much they enjoyed it. Happily I still enjoyed this book, my friendship with Emily is safe.3. The BBC TV series recently aired and was totally and completely brilliant, the performance of Stephen Mangan as Dirk Gently is as close to perfection as you get in a TV adaptation. So good was his performance that I read through this book today and could only imagine him as Dirk, as if Adams wrote it with him in mind (impossible but Dirk doesn't have any problems with impossible, as long as he can find out how it's done.)4. Written in 1987 apparently pizza was not delivered in the UK at this time. The horror! I cannot imagine a world where you can't get pizza delivered. No wonder Pizza Hut was such a big thing when it opened in my town as a child.5. Combining the content of this novel and the fact that he wrote Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion, Neil Gaiman was clearly influenced by Adams when writing American Gods AND for the first time I realised that some of the parts of Good Omens I'd attributed to Terry Pratchett in my mind were obviously examples of early Gaiman.And there you have it, another collection of words written about this book on GR. Well worth reading."], ["I love Douglas Adams but this book missed the mark a wee bit for me. Although the stuff with the gods was fun I'm not sure how much help Dirk was and the ending was a little abrupt. But otherwise, there were some funny parts."], ["Unfortunately, Adams' sequel to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency isn't as tightly-written as its predecessor. On the sentence level, Adams is still writing furiously funny jokes, but The Long, Dark Tea-Time of the Soul ends up feeling like first-class humor wrapped loosely around second-class plot and characters. Adams has been accused of writing punchlines rather than plots, and it shows in this book perhaps more so than anywhere else. I also thought the book's flow suffered greatly in places, with important scenes not having enough space devoted to their development (especially in the last few pages, such as the Valhalla scene). In addition, Dirk Gently's \"fundamental interconnectedness\" approach to investigation--where everything is important because it's linked to everything else--is still present here, but the linked items don't line up as neatly as they did in the first book. I also found the conclusion lacking: at the end of Dirk Gently's..., I said \"Fantastic!\" aloud to the room around me; at the end of The Long, Dark... I turned the page and, when there was nothing else to read, said aloud, \"That's it?\" So: five stars for humor, but minus two for poor plot and flow."], ["This is very hard for me, you know? I love Douglas Adams; I adore his phrasing, his word structure, and how he manages to make things seem funny,ridiculous, menacing or heartbreaking. I've loved the Hitchhiker books, and he continues to be one of the writers I care for quite immensely.This is why rating this book as 3/5 is so sad for me, this book started off great, with plenty of intrigue and mystery, and a bunch of characters that seemed interesting and off their rockers (in other words, regular Adams fare). So, I thought I was going to love it, and I did!But then I came to the last few chapters, and it seems like someone was on Adams's case, asking him to finish the damn book. The whole thing seems hurried, with characters jumping around and events taking place so fast that you couldn't even tell what had happened until you've read it again. His randomness, which is endearing when used carefully, is tossed about everywhere, as he ties up every single loose end in a matter of a few paragraphs.I won't lie; I felt cheated by the end of this book, and I don't like to be cheated."], ["Lots of hilarious moments, though the pacing's not quite up to the level set in the first Dirk Gently book.

'Once you have discounted the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.' \"\"I reject that entirely,\" said Dirk sharply. \"The impossible often has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks. How often have you been presented with an apparently rational explanation of something that works in all respects other than one, which is just that it is hopelessly improbable? Your instinct is to say, 'Yes, but he or she simply wouldn't do that.' \"\"Well, it happened to me today, in fact,\" replied Kate.\"Ah, yes,\" said Dirk, slapping the table and making the glasses jump, \"your girl in the wheelchair--a perfect example. The idea that she is somehow receiving yesterday's stock market prices apparently out of thin air is merely impossible, and therefore must be the case, because the idea that she is maintaining an immensely complex and laborious hoax of no benefit to herself is hopelessly improbable. The first idea merely supposes that there is something we don't know about, and God knows there are enough of those. The second, however, runs contrary to something fundamental and human which we do know about. We should therefore be very suspicious of it and all its specious rationality.\"Words to live by.

This probably has less to do with the book itself, which I'm sure is fine, and more with having worked in a homeless shelter and thus not being terribly interested in what goes on inside them, nor anything having to do with homeless men, be they drunk, mentally-ill, or somebody's long lost father.... I also have this weird aversion to Boston, so maybe that played into it. I kept coming up with all these weird opinions about the type of guy I imagined the author to be (has sideburns; loves Guinness, crappy bands), and deciding I didn't like him, then realizing these ideas were entirely based on my hateful stereotypes about guys from Boston, and had nothing at all to do with poor Nick Flynn, who I'm sure is a fine fellow with excellent taste in music. Anyway, all these problems sort of combined, and finally I realized that reading this book was causing me more mental anguish than I was willing to put myself through, and I threw up my hands. My unfulfilled yearning for the beautiful cover played a large role in my purchase around that time of _Black Swan Green_, which has some superficially similar elements (it's black and green) but is obviously vastly inferior (I think you might recognize this kind of phenomenon from the world of dating).But what a great title!

We could argue about it, but trust me, it's my problem and it's not resolving. So it was really hard for me to get into this book.

But it's definitely amazing. Don't confuse it with just another quirky family memoir: it has emotionally raw and real things to say about alcoholism, mental illness, heredity, and the homeless. (Each person from the shelter is drawn so distinctively it makes you realize how reductive and dismissive the term \"the homeless\" really is).I make it sounds harsh and dark--which it is--but there is also a deadpan sense of humor running through it, eliciting the relieved, nervous laughter you get when you just catch yourself overbalancing on a rickety ladder. Flynn takes a lot of stylistic chances to keep making the story immediate and arresting. Not everything works--for me, the Lear chapter doesn't quite cut it--but so many other chapters (\"Ham\" and \"Cloverleaf\" and \"Same Again\") are just stunning."], ["The credit for this book\u2019s colorful title goes to Nick Flynn\u2019s dad, the main protagonist in his memoir of coming to know himself through a chance reunion with his father. The story initially focuses on the early parallels between young Flynn and his estranged, alcoholic father. The author then brings us to a Boston homeless shelter where he held a minimum-wage job for 5 years after living alone on a houseboat near Boston Harbor. Father and son\u2019s lives fatefully intersect in the shelter when his dad becomes a regular, but highly-volatile, unwelcome guest. As a Boston native, I appreciated Flynn\u2019s wry surveying of the City during his nightly voyages in the homeless shelter van. He was usually successful rounding up the deinstitutionalized and others made homeless by chance or by choice; however, he was often unable to corral his own father, that is, when he didn\u2019t purposely avoid his usual haunts. Flynn\u2019s dad burned all personal and professional bridges long before he wound up on the streets, and it seems all he has left is his ego, buttressed by grandiose notions about his skill as a writer. He talks ad nauseam (to the reader\u2019s amusement) about his great semi-autobiographical novel that has gone unrecognized (this tome may or may not have ever been completed). As proof someone was interested in this work, he frames \u201cpersonal\u201d notes (form rejection letters) he received from publishing houses. Flynn is first a poet, and you see his skill as he deftly crafts lyrical passages about their shared mental illness and sometimes self-destructive streak of eschewing convention\u2014and help when needed. For good or bad, they are both self-made men who have a talent for storytelling. You get the sense that Nick\u2019s book serves to tell his own story, but also that of Flynn Sr., who never had the discipline or courage to get it down himself."], ["Now here goes a book that is creatively non-fiction...If you want to read a book that breaks all the rules, while hearing the survival story of a boy who is abandoned by his mother and homeless father, read this book.

Now, amidst the tweet storms of President Trump, I find it central to understanding the devolution of our political discourse.Frankfurt demonstrates, through argument and example, the difference between lying and bullshit: the liar knows what is true (or else he would not be lying), whereas the bullshitter cares nothing about truth or lies. The bullshitter really does not give a damn.I find this distinction useful now when dealing with political bloviating or religious propaganda. I used to look at each jeremiad as a fabric of lies, isolating each untruthful or illogical thread, refuting and dismantling it bit by bit. This of course took up much of my time which would be better spent writing Goodreads reviews or working on my novel.But now, since reading Harry G.

As others on GR have remarked, we have entered into a political era in the US of pure, unadulterated bullshit with the election of Drumpf and so it is quite the timely read. Mr. Frankfurt starts by looking at dictionary definitions of \"humbug\" and \"bull session\" and compares them to the concept of bullshit: the line to be drawn semantically between lying and bullshitting is quite a convoluted one as it turns out. He has one animated story about a certain Pascal who is castigated by a certain Wittgenstein for using the phrase \"I feel like a dog that got run over\" as an example where W calls her out on bullshit. I thought that line was a bit thin and that expressions such as this are purely allegorical and do not really fall into the bullshit category and that Wittgenstein was annoying splitting hairs over it. The author also quotes the amazing Ezra Pound, where the poet does not want to be bullshitted. (I laughed out loud at that one.) But most importantly, just before the conclusion of this short 65-page essay, he makes a valid point that bullshitting is a greater enemy to the truth than lies - precisely because it is manipulative and never benevolent. Putting that in the perspective of the nightly flood of excrement on CNN and Fox seems very apt to me. The essay ends with a facetious but humorous point about all sincerity being bullshit. OK, that may be true, it does not undermine he previous points. So, take a shot at this little marvel and see where you stand On Bullshit!Thanks for all the comments and Likes! Who'd've thought that Bullshit could be so popular?

BS. It's one long mental wank lecture by a college professor of the word and its meanings in every possible boring, mildly-interesting, wow, I didn't know that, kind of way.

You can read the paragraph above in a slightly negative tone of voice and then it also reads in an ironic kind of way that I kind of admire the professor and had also quite enjoyed both his work and why he did it.

The whole production team was staring expectantly at me.To gain time, I asked:\"How much was the gap initially?\"\"Two metres.\"\"Hmm... and how much now?\"\"A metre.\"\"And you say the deposition has decreased, and you can live with it.\"\"Yes.\"\"Well...\" I said, scratching my chin and trying to look knowledgeable: \"You've left it very narrow, but it seems to be OK.

As he points out, the bullshit artist often lies, but need not do so: some bullshit is, more or less by accident, perfectly true.

In particular, the distinction is being made between lies and bullshit, following the work of Harry Frankfurt. The difference is that someone who tells a lie has access to the truth, whereas the concept of bullshit requires no knowledge of the truth at all. That is, the liar knows that what he says is not true, whereas the bullshitter has no proper knowledge to support the statements he or she is making. (Martin Caminada, University of Luxembourg).\nBefore I read this essay, I had no idea who Harry Frankfurt was and it wasn\u2019t until I had done some research last night before beginning this book that I found out that he\u2019s a renowned moral philosopher and realized He is professor emeritus of philosophy at Princeton University and has previously taught at Yale University and Rockefeller University.So the tiny hardback that I had initially purchased had been because of the title and I thought that it would prove to be amusing. I wouldn\u2019t really call this book amusing but it made me think, and thus when reasoning came into the equation, the book thus took me far longer to read.I always thought that \u201cbullshit\u201d was on a par with \u201clying\u201d and \u201cbull\u201d but obviously that\u2019s not the case and as for \u201chumbug\u201d? I must confess that I haven\u2019t really thought about it. Basically don\u2019t they all deal with some form of nonsense? One can just sail through life with vocabulary and actually be unaware of the true essence of words.I can give you an example of what I perceived to be bullshit at the time. I have a brother, Roy, who is eleven years older than me. He\u2019s indeed a bullshitter and known for it by our family and all of his friends. I recall when I was about ten he took me out in his car through the countryside, as he was en route to his girlfriend Sue. My mother had insisted that I went along. Was I some kind of junior chaperone? When we arrived at Sue\u2019s home, I was given a book to read and stayed in the lounge on my own for about two hours. What did they get up to?Well we passed some cows in the field on the left and Roy laughed. \u201cGuess what Lynne? I was following a mini the other day and it came to this exact spot. It then suddenly flipped over the hedge and landed on top of a cow\u201d! I ask you. It\u2019s nonsense I know but is that bullshit, bull or humbug ? I knew that it was fanciful and did Roy make me laugh. I never could find out though what had happened to the cow or the car.I realize that philosophers are searching for wisdom and enlightenment but it is really all down to interpretation and the thought processes are all so different. I didn\u2019t have too much of a problem with Descartes as I read him at university and also Seneca but when it gets to Roger Scruton; he is way above me in his thinking process. So this book, although thoroughly enjoyable, I wondered, when I arrived at a reference to Wittgenstein, how I would react to him. He evidently detested any form of \u201cnonsense\u201d which actually rather amused me and so I could certainly appreciate how he would relate to a comment made by Fania Pascal, who had known him at Cambridge in the thirties:I had my tonsils out and was in the Evelyn Nursing Home feeling sorry for myself. Wittgenstein called. I croaked \u201cI feel just like a dog that has been run over.\u201d\u2019 He was disgusted: \u201cYou don\u2019t what a dog that has been run over feels like.\u201dIt makes one wonder though if what Fania said was true or was Wittgenstein joking or trying to joke anyway? Difficult really to determine without knowing the facts.I don\u2019t think that I could have handled a much larger book than this but this was definitely good as a taster and sometimes tasters are the best things in life.Thanks Rakhi for enticing me with your somewhat brief review."]], "review_count": "832", "description": "A #1 \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BESTSELLER<br /><br />One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, \"we have no theory.\"<br /><br />Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.<br /><br />Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.", "author": "Harry G.

The Grandmaster tells the story of the first survey ships going out into deep space to look for suitable planets for humanity to colonize due to overpopulation on Earth. Needing a simultaneous communications system, the powers that be hire on groups of telepathic twins (or triplets) to provide real time coms between the ship and Earth. (Ten years before Ursula K. LeGuin\u2019s ansible, which was first described in her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.Central to the narrative is the accepted theory of special relativity, whereby a voyager on a spaceship traveling at close to light speed will experience a different time than a person on Earth. The protagonist aboard the Lewis and Clark remains relatively young while his telepathic twin on Earth grows old. This concept is also explored in Joe Haldeman\u2019s The Forever War and most notably in Poul Anderson\u2019s Tau Zero.Heinlein also explores the concept of faster than light travel and these ideas may have been included in his notes for the novel that would be completed and published after his death by Spider Robinson in Variable Star.A good friend of mine suggested that a reader who favors Heinlein\u2019s early / juvenile works over his middle works from the sixties and his later experiments with the tacky and wacky feels this way because that was the reader\u2019s first exposure to Heinlein\u2019s work. This could be true, as I have always liked his juveniles and these were my first books of his I read. In whichever camp one finds himself, Time for the Stats is one of his better novels.My final point to make on this book is an unusual observation about Heinlein\u2019s work in general. According to Goodreads, Time for the Stars is my thirty-second Heinlein book. Bob mentions cannibalism in a lot of his works. Weird, creepy, unusual. By my recollection, I think he has mentioned cannibalism in each of the following works:Orphans of the SkyStranger in a Strange LandTime for the StarsFarnham's FreeholdFor Us, the Living: A Comedy of CustomsMethuselah's ChildrenThe Cat Who Walks Through WallsThe Moon Is a Harsh MistressStarship Troopers"], ["- Good afternoon, may I talk with Professor Einstein?- Speaking.- Ah, I just wonder if I could have a few minutes of your time sir, this won't take long...- And who are you, young man?- Oh, I'm sorry, I should have said. My name's Bob Heinlein. You wouldn't have heard of me...- On the contrary, I know exactly who you are. I bought a copy of your novel Space Cadet for my godson's eleventh birthday, and he was most complimentary. In fact, he said it was the best thing he'd ever read.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"], ["Slowly but surely, my obsession with young adult space stories will knock every Heinlein juvenile book off my to-read list. A month or two ago, I read Podkayne of Mars and while I did enjoy the audio format and the underlying world-building, the characters grated on me. I'd read and heard from several sources that Heinlein's treatment of his female characters can be a huge turnoff and he's two for two on that note for me thus far. I'm not going to go over why I felt the way I did about Podkayne but in Time for the Stars, though it was far less frustrating, I was still not satisfied with the female presence in the book. But I'm getting ahead of myself, what's the book actually about? It's a futuristic Earth setting where families are allowed only a certain number of children before they get taxed. Identical twins Tom and Pat are asked to come in for some testing by a huge research organization, one whose mission is to fund the projects that have projected results so far into the future that no one else will fund them. Through the testing, Tom and Pat find out they are telepathically connected. The foundation intends to explore the galaxies to find potential colony planets and uses telepathic pairs to communicate between ships and between ships and Earth when radio transmissions no longer work. I don't want to spoil which twin goes to space and which stays behind because I enjoyed that aspect of the story. I cannot think of another instance of a book where identical twins do not really get along. Heinlein adds in a realistic amount of sibling manipulation that rang true to life. (\"Do your chores, Dad will be home soon.\" \"Why? If I don't, I know you'll just do them for me.\" - Me and my sister)The science and philosophy are very much present in this novel and some of it went over my head. Faster than light, simultaneity, time, relativism, the science of aging, and various equations and theories are all present and accounted for but never in a severe infodump kind of way. The book is set up as a diary written by the twin in space. I am not sure if it is broken up as such in the traditional book as I listened to the audiobook but the scientific conversations were usually just that--conversations between the twin and someone else on the ship. However, there is very little action to keep the book going. The interest lies in the world Heinlein has created and the scientific offshoots. I was fascinated by the idea that as one twin was aging \"regularly\" on Earth, the other was aging at a far slower rate, so much so that the twin in space had to do the telepathic work with several generations down the line. What action there is is backloaded. His books, to me, feel like someone is writing about a fantastic futuristic world and then realizing halfway through that there's supposed to also be character building and plot movement. On to the creep factor. There was just an episode of 30 Rock on television wherein Liz Lemon realizes that she is dating her third cousin. They say, \"On the count of three, say how many cousins removed we'd have to be to try to make this work.\" He says fifth and she says never. I really think my answer is also never. There are several pubescent boy relationships in this book as well as adult relationships but there is one that relates to the 30 Rock episode I just spoke of. I won't ruin it for any potential readers but Heinlein basically glossed right over the relation aspect and it felt cut and dried in the most awkward way possible. I actually said, \"Whaaaaaaat? Dude.\" to my car stereo. You're going to marry your relation, no matter how distant? Ew.Back to Heinlein's treatment of women. Here's the gist: If you want to read any of his books, just think to yourself, \"Am I okay reading a book where no female character will ever be completely rational? One where she will never be seen as anything other than a gender stereotype or achieve life goals beyond society's expectations during the forties and fifties when these books were written?\" If the answer is yes, then read away. As I've said, Heinlein creates some interesting scientific worlds and stories. However, if you're answer is no then these books will be a nightmare for you. There are entire conversations about the best way to tell a mother that her son/s are joining a space program but also how to manipulate her irrational emotions. A grown woman wants to join a specific mission and another character tells her to check with her husband. (who also tells her later that they will be moving back to Earth to raise their family and she will not be working anymore) The mission finds a planet and fights in a battle but both times women are excluded from the teams--until one planet is deemed \"safe enough that even the women could go!\" Being a woman in Heinlein's world just seems like it would be so depressing. Who wants to achieve their dreams of being independent and going into space? Not so fast, vaginas! I believe this is the first audiobook I've listened to that is narrated by Barrett Whitener, and I enjoyed his narration for the most part. Though they are not coming to me at the moment, there were a few words he pronounced in a weird way (maybe alternate pronunciations?) and several of the characters sounded the same. At one point, I wasn' t sure if the captain had an American, British, or Australian accent. He is a conversational narrator so his voice was/is well-suited to the diary-entry format of Time for the Stars.As is the story with Podkayne of Mars, there is enough fun world-building present that I wish Heinlein would set more books in this world, perhaps even incorporate some of the same characters. I have a feeling my wish will come true with the rest of his young adult books. I anticipate each one will be a fun sciencey adventures/feminist's nightmare.Also seen at The Readventurer."], ["Originally posted at FanLit:http://www.fantasyliterature.com/revi...Time for the Stars is one of my favorite Heinlein Juveniles, and I like his juveniles better than his books for adults, so I guess that makes Time of the Stars one of my favorite Heinlein works. It\u2019s got everything that makes his stories so much fun to read, especially for kids. Likeable heroes, sweet relationships, real emotions, a touch of romance, a bit of physics, spaceship travel and exploration of distant planets. (And also, as usual, there\u2019s a hint of incest \u2014 romance with a cousin \u2014 and a few complaints about taxes. It is a Heinlein novel, after all.)In Time for the Stars, twins Tom and Pat join an experimental scientific study to see if telepathy might be a viable way for Earth to communicate with her exploring spaceships. It\u2019s thought that if telepathy could work for anyone, it would be identical twins. Tom and Pat are excited to be involved, but they know this means that one of them will get to explore space while the other one has to stay home to be the other end of the telepathic line. This fact has a lot of ramification for the brothers. First of all, the boys have to decide who gets to go. Second, the one who leaves will probably never see his family again. Third, the boys will now age at different rates because of relativity, so even if the one who leaves ever comes back, he will be much younger than his twin.All of this gives Time for the Stars an emotional texture that makes this story feel weightier than your average YA SF adventure. Also, Time for the Stars is not just a story about exploring space \u2014 it\u2019s about family, friendship, loneliness, love, guilt, and the power of the human mind. In fact, I think Heinlein spends more time exploring the brain than exploring distant galaxies.Time for the Stars is an entertaining and moving YA space adventure that will probably please most adults as well as kids. I listened to Barrett Whitener narrate Blackstone Audio\u2019s version. I thought his voice, tone, and cadence were perfect for this emotional story."], ["This was my first Heinlein novel. It probably deserves only 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 because this novel showed me why Heinlein is one of the fathers of science fiction. The world-building of the future is done so well, especially in the case of the science and the explanation of it in ways that allowed me to suspend disbelief. The motivations behind why the characters in the book were sent to space made logical sense, and the exploration of what happens to time when you are traveling at the speed of light were fascinating. Additionally, as a coming of age novel I could imagine this resonating with young people (boys, in particular) as we get inside the narrator's head as he experiences his growth from adolescence to adulthood while in space.Where this book loses stars is the dated feel to it. Though the science seems advanced, the social aspects of the world are clearly colored by the time that Heinlein wrote it. This is a future where women still defer to their husbands and hold domestic roles almost exclusively (with a few exceptions). The social relationships are what makes this book feel less futuristic than it might. Combine that with the fact that there only substantial character is the main character, the character building falls a bit short. Lastly, the end of this novel... wtf? I won't spoil it, but it seemed very strange.Still, I will definitely read more Heinlein after this!"], ["I had forgotten about this Heinlein juvenile completely thinking I was reading it for the first time, but part way in I realized that I had read it before. The human race has finally created a source of propulsion for ships that can offer constant boost and carry its fuel. That means it's \"time for the stars.\" Population pressure and the sort of intrepid adventurousness Heinlein always so brilliantly portrays drives our heroes out in ships pushing the speed of light knowing that relativistic effects will have them return eventually to earth after many decades have passed leaving their world immeasurably changed.As light years stack up, both transmission time and the energy required for transmitting become intractable. This provides a way to have our heroes cut off and return to strangeness. Instead, in Time For The Stars, Heinlein allows communication by positing telepathic abilities that are instantaneous between some identical twins. The Long Range Foundation pays high fees to incent twin pairs to split up, one going on ship and one staying home. This sets the scene for taking two teenage boys who are as close as any are likely to be and first putting a spike in the relationship by offering just one the dream of a lifetime, being among the first to get to explore the stars, provided the other stays home, and then have them linked and maintain their relationship over a few years for one and a long lifetime for the other. You get to see the relationship evolve as one member of the relationship lives out his teen years and the other has great-grandchildren.It's a gripping story, full of action like all the Heinlein juveniles, but also has touching relationship components, sometimes missing from those stories. I enjoyed it thoroughly.2015: The kids particularly enjoyed this one."], ["Pop culture is often dismissed as simply low culture \u2013 in contrast to the high art of opera or classical music or abstract expressionism. And there\u2019s good reason: As long-ago scifi author Theodore Sturgeon once pointed out, \u201cNinety percent of everything is trash.\u201dA simple tour through the cable channels, or spin of the radio dial, will prove Sturgeon right, and in the mass of modern pop culture it\u2019s much harder to filter out the signal from the noise. In classical music, for example, the bad symphonies simply never get played because time has winnowed the field to only the best.But even if pop culture doesn\u2019t always deliver quality, it does have something else to offer: a window on the modern world. Though movies, books and music take time to work their way from inspiration to dissemination, they still have a relatively brief gestation, and taken as a whole, they reflect and amplify some oftentimes hidden aspects of our culture.Since this is a science fiction and fantasy column, it\u2019s pretty obvious what the focus will be, but the same arguments apply across a much broader spectrum \u2013 and the same insights emerge.Recently, publishers sent me a couple of books by writers from the so-called Golden Age (which shines much more brightly because, like classical music, the trash has been forgotten). The first, \u201cThe Voyage of the Space Beagle\u201d (Orb, $14.95, 215 pages), by A.E. Van Vogt, holds up remarkably well, while Robert Heinlein\u2019s \u201cTime for the Stars\u201d (Orb, $14.95, 244 pages) shows it age. Nonetheless, both share a quality that is almost always missing from modern scifi: optimism.In both books, there\u2019s a sense that problems will be solved, both individually and collectively. The future is bright, human beings are capable (if not exceptional) and the triumph of progress (and thus the good) is inevitable. You can read far and wide in 21st century scifi (especially that with a serious intent) and not find much to bolster any of those beliefs.Two other veterans who worked in the 1950s (\u201cThe Voyage of the Space Beagle\u201d came out in 1950, \u201cTime for the Stars\u201d in 1956) combined for a new book, \u201cThe Last Theorem\u201d (Ballantine Books, $27, 299 pages). It\u2019s not up to their best work, which is not surprising, but even so, that sense of optimism shines through. Human beings will still struggle and make mistakes but Arthur C. Clarke (who died recently) and Frederick Pohl not only acknowledge, but celebrate, humanity\u2019s abilities.Most writers whose careers are firmly rooted in the 21st century have little truck with such sunny outlooks. At a surface level, the books are full of blood and pain. Authors make sure that their heroes fight realistically \u2013 the crunch of bone, the burst of blood, the tide of pain, are always meticulously recounted. But beyond that, there is an underlying despair that humanity will ever get it right. If it\u2019s not environmental disaster, it\u2019s the inability to control technology; if it\u2019s not escaped microbes gone wild, it\u2019s war with civilization-destroying weapons.And that, to this American who remembers when the United States did not invade foreign countries for no apparent reason (from Vietnam to Iraq), when the promise of technology was greater than the dangers of terrorism, when Mother Nature seemed to be kind rather than vengeful, is more than a little depressing. For if the light shone on modern culture by science fiction in particular and pop culture in general is so obscured by the grey fog of despair, does it mean that the 21st century world is on the way to giving up? If the heroes can\u2019t solve the problems, or are turned into antiheroes who cannot find a way to glory without compromising their ideals and values, then who will stand up and lead? If these dark visions are correct, what will the world our children and grandchildren inherit really look like?Of course, every older generation always thinks the world is going to hell in a hand basket \u2013 and the phrase itself gives the lie to its prediction. I don\u2019t even know what a hand basket is, which reminds me that the pessimism of the elders does not necessarily doom the young ones. And in fact, there are some science fiction authors who still cling to the old tropes, the vision of humans as problem-solvers and not carriers of a culture-killing disease.At the top of that list for me is John Scalzi, who has a new book out (\u201cZoe\u2019s Tale\u201d (Tor, $24.95, 336 pages)) that brings a different narrator to some of the events from the satisfying \u201cThe Last Colony.\u201d \u201cZoe\u2019s Tale\u201d isn\u2019t completely successful, as its depiction of its female teen-age heroine seems to me \u2013 someone who has coached teen-age girls for more than 20 years \u2013 impossible to credit, but it is still a book in which problems are solved, and positive resolutions are reached.The same is true Scalzi\u2019s \u201cAgent for the Stars\u201d (Tor, $14.95, 352 pages), which he wrote more than a decade ago but is just now getting widespread distribution. \u201cAgent for the Stars\u201d is also funny, and not in a dark, vein-slicing way, which is another rarity as the young century wears on.A pair of writers \u2013 Gary K. Wolf and Archbishop John J. Myers \u2013 went all-out for the past with \u201cSpace Vulture\u201d (Tor, $24.95, 333 pages), an unabashedly old-fashioned space opera with heroes, villains, coincidences, and all the trappings of old-time science fiction \u2013 and old-time westerns, as far as that goes. But simply re-working the old themes doesn\u2019t make this book more than just a diversion, while the Isaac Asimovs and Clifford D. Simaks of the \u201950s and \u201860s were reflecting the underlying positive attitudes of an entire culture.Scalzi echoes that optimism, but the vision of most of the writers working in this pop culture field is generally darker, more depressing and seldom ends well. Even when the heroes win, the scars take long to heal, and there\u2019s no sense that the most serious problems will be solved, or that progress has been made. Usually, in fact, the protagonist is pretty much back where he started, after much pain and suffering, and more blows to any belief that the world can be made a better place.Of course, it\u2019s not possible for scifi and fantasy writers, or anyone involved in pop culture, to truly shift the direction of the great mass of people, and if they are too far from the edge of the pack, they will simply be ignored. Nonetheless, the message that\u2019s being sent \u2013 that the future is dark and getting darker -- is not one that should be ignored, as it\u2019s just one more warning sign that the road the worldwide culture has been traveling does not appear to lead to many happy endings."], ["I actually find Heinlein's juveniles a lot more interesting than his later work these days.For those not in the know, Heinlein wrote a lot, and his books can generally be divided into three periods (or maybe just two). First, he wrote an awful lot of juveniles, which would be considered young-adult today. They almost always feature young protagonists (still in school) and revolve around adventure and family. These books came out between 1947 and 1959.The turning point for Heinlein was the (in)famous time-travel story All You Zombies in which--using both time travel and sex-change operations, a single person ends up being his/her own father/mother/son/daughter. It's quite dark--and a definite departure from the apple-pie family dynamics of the juveniles--but then again, the apple-pie family dynamics were never actually really that straight forward. (More on that in a bit).Anyway, that story was written in 1958 (in a single day) and then published in 1959, which is the same year that Starship Troopers came out. According to Wikipedia, Starship Troopers is the last of his early novels, but I'd put it as the first of the middle period. It's transitional, though, so I can see the reasoning. It has the typical structure of one of his juveniles (e.g. a single, young, viewpoint protagonist) but also has a lot of the themes of his later work (e.g. overt politics that deviate from the mainstream). Wikipedia also tacks on a third phase of his writing (for novels from 1985 onwards) and I've read one of those: The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. I remember the ending brought tears to my eyes, even though Heinlein was being brazenly manipulative. He was always kind of a jerk that way, much like his alter-ego Jubal Harshaw. I don't really follow the division between the second and third period myself.My point, however, is that as a kid doing research for a paper on sci-fi, I learned about the turning point in Heinlein's writing and I was only interested in the later, \"serious\" stuff, like Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and Stranger in a Strange Land. So I read all those first, and never got around to the juveniles. But now that I'm an Audible subscriber and Heinlein novels are often for sale for $5 or less, I've worked my way through a lot of the early work. None of them have the impact of his later work, but in their own way their more interesting, because you can see the early manifestation of the nutso stuff before it came on full-force.For example, there's the preoccupation with pushing sexual boundaries in general and incest in particular. In Farnham's Freehold--the painfully dated anti-racist screed--the incest is father/daughter. But that's well into his middle period (1964). In this book, the incest is much more remote: the main character marries his twin brother's grand-daughter, which is far enough to be \"hardly related\" as the character says at one point. The age gap is also less, since the main character spends about 60 Earth-years zooming around at near light speed, so that when she's 19 he's 23 or 24. Similarly, Orphans of the Sky pushes the boundaries as well with polygamy. (Wikipedia puts the book in his middle period because it came out in 1964, but it's a fix-up novel made from shorter works that were published in 1941, so it ought to be categorized in his first phase.) But I think the thing that's most interesting is that--when he had to keep editors satisfied that his writing was largely kid-safe--he was just as stridently political. He just chose to be strident about acceptable topics. Thus his book is laced with pithy declaratives like, \"I sometimes think \"good intentions\" should be declared a capital crime,\" or \"Learning isn't a means to an end; it is an end in itself,\" etc. Lots of manly, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps stuff that wouldn't go amiss in the 1950s.Then in his second phase, he started writing openly against racism (although, again, it doesn't read well to a 21st century ear) and preaching about free love and his odd mashup of totalitarian fascism and libetarianism. And so it just makes me wonder, as I'm going through the juvie stuff, how much of this apple-pie politics was sincere and how much an affectation to keep the editors satisfied while still scratching his itch to pontificate?It's hard to say, but I'd hazard a guess that he basically believed every word he wrote, no matter how apparently contradictory. At least, I'm pretty sure that if he were still around and you pressed him, that's what he'd say.Oh, but is it a good story? Look, it's a kids sci-fi book from the 1960s. You read this because you have a historical interest in sci-fi in general or Heinlein in particular. It's an enjoyable enough read, but if you're looking for sheer enjoyment there's lots of other stuff to read first. Thus, the three stars.EDITED TO ADD: I almost forgot one interesting thing. There's a minor sequence in the middle of the book when the protagonist is bullied by a younger, smaller, smarter kid. I think it might be one of the only times in all of sci-fi when that happens, like a sort of anti-Ender's Game situation. It was interesting."], ["This science-fiction novel was exactly what I was looking for at this time. It dealt with mankind's first exploration of planets outside our solar system. What I especially loved was the author did not burden the reader with tons of technical language. It was kept to a bare minimum. I'm so glad that I read TIME FOR THE STARS (1956) by Robert Heinlein."], ["\u201cI don\u2019t like to be around twins, they make me think I\u2019m seeing double.\u201dTime for the Stars is one of the twelve \u2018Heinlein Juveniles\u2019 series of books the author wrote between 1947 and 1958. Wikipedia states that \u201ctheir intended readership was teenage boys\u201d. They would probably fall under the YA category today. After a bit of research on the web, it would seem that these YA books by Heinlein are still rated and respected by a number of readers. But it should be remembered that these were written over sixty years ago and will obviously show some signs of their age.Brief Summary-This is an adventure story about telepathic twins Tom and Pat Bartlett. -They take part in an experiment concerning telepathy and communication between spaceships.-There are some imaginative scenes of space and planetary exploration.-The book touches on the twin paradox regarding travel at the speed of light and aging.-It also addresses family relationships and sibling rivalry.-The ending is a bit of a \u201cWait! Did that just happen?....\u201d moment.I read this straight after Starship Troopers, and it felt like a breath of fresh air. This book is much lighter and funnier than Heinlein\u2019s most (in)famous work, but the didacticism is still extant. It contains some laugh-out-loud lines along with the author\u2019s token dismissive treatment of any female characters. \u201cShe was awfully pretty, I decided, even though she was too old for it to matter \u2026 at least thirty, maybe older.\u201d\u201cThey were red-headed sisters, younger than we were but not too young \u2013 sixteen, maybe \u2013 and cute as Persian kittens.\u201dYes it does read like a YA story but it also reads like Heinlein enjoyed writing it. Despite the \u201cjuvenile\u201d target audience there is a fair amount of science in the SF, specifically regarding the nature of time in relation to interstellar travel. I also enjoyed the way the author acknowledged the problems of long-distance communication between Earth and deep space.Without being particularly special, this book has made me want to try a couple more of his works. I have been warned off some of Heinlein\u2019s later stories, but I\u2019m open to suggestions for what anyone thinks is worth a read. I\u2019m curious to see if I can discover why he is still so lauded over 60 years later. https://biginjapangrayman.wordpress.c...(Wait, what just happened at the end?

Heinlein"}, "Bullets, Badges, and Bullshit": {"average_rating": "0.00", "review": [["Upon starting this book I thought, \"wouldn't it be ironic if this book itself turned out to be bullshit\"? Alas, despite my high hopes going in, that's exactly what it is. To start with, there are the small issues, such as the fact that, having been written in 2005, most of the content and especially tone of this book is hopelessly dated by today's standards - anything bitching about the Bush administration is just hopelessly passe these days, and the fact that the author didn't like the bullshit-laden cynicism of that administration seems to be pretty much the entire point of this book, at a time when such sentiments were hardly unique. With the exception of a few mildly interesting \"organization of knowledge\" type ideas about the nature of bullshit in the first few pages, there isn't a single thought in this book that someone else hadn't already thought of by 2005. This would be fine if not for Penny's annoying habit of turning every. single. sentence. into a series of rhetorical flourishes in a tone that screams \"look at how clever and edgy I am\", but mostly just succeeds in conveying that she's trying too hard to be clever and edgy. This makes her writing not only difficult to scan but tiresome to actually read. I would've been willing to forgive this transgression, though, if not for the much larger issue that Penny makes no effort whatsoever to be anything but derivative of all of the other anti-Bush screeds circulating at the time, or to actually show that she is capable of using her education in any way other than appealing to that laziest common denominator of Bush-era liberal discontent. Absolutely no attempt is made at any time to cite any actual facts or to make any original contribution beyond the first few pages. It should therefore come as no surprise that Penny's argument is riddled with factual errors. At first, it's just minor, annoying things such as referring to her disdain for commercials featuring a nonexistent SUV called the \"Chevrolet Tacoma\", but as the book goes on she starts misquoting history in ways that undermine her argument (e.g. misidentifying both Jamestown and New England as being essentially corporate constructions from the beginning, when New England was no such thing.) and assuming that the reader has never heard of and apparently will never hear of James Comey, who as of this writing is head of the FBI. [May 2017 update: No one will ever hear of James Comey? Never ever? Hoo boy...]If Penny had made errors like this once or twice it would be forgivable, but she does it so often that it undermines her credibility, since mostly these are errors that would require about a minute of Google time in order to fix. Dude, if Al Franken could cite his sources for the anti-Bush screeds he produced during this period, so can you. That this sort of shoddy, mass-produced work should appear in a one-dimensional liberal screed about how shoddy and mass-produced our culture has become is as ironic as it is sad, because it doesn't challenge the premise that even our \"intellectual\" polemics in opposition to mass-produced bullshit have to be mass-produced bullshit in and of themselves. Despite its initial intentions, this book is ultimately a product of the very same corporate profiteering and societal attention span issues that Penny herself is railing against. It exists not because Penny is a brilliant, or even coherent author, but simply because there was a market for this sort of writing in 2005, so someone published it to cash in, seeing the potential market of 59,028,444 (John Kerry's share of the 2004 electorate) US citizens alone who were dissatisfied with the then-present administration. Penny's failure to recognize this, as well as the unfortunately dated nature of many of these observations, is really what makes this book so insufferable. It also explains why, when I bought this book shortly after Obama took office, it was out of a stack of about two dozen remainders. It's a shame, because there are some good ideas recycled here, and even a handful of entertaining witticisms, but ultimately this is just not a book that will appeal to most people this far after the fact, at least if you want anything more than superficial affirmation that your dislike of George W. Bush ten years ago was probably justified for one reason or another. As if evidence of that fact wasn't painfully obvious today in too many other ways."], ["\"If the minimum wage had inflated as much as CEO pay or margin debt, cashiers and rib-joint ladies would be making hundreds of dollars an hour.\"\"In 1980, CEOs made 42 times the average worker's pay; by 1990,it had doubled; by 2000 their compensation had increased to 531 times the average salary.\"Interesting stuff - a must read!"], ["I hoped this would be an in-depth look at marketing and customer service tactics. Instead it was mostly a now-dated rant about the Bush administration."], ["A self-styled rant about the frustrations of modern society11 October 2013\tThere is not all that much that sets this book apart from all of the other anti-corporate books that have been released, except that at the end the writer says that this is not so much a book to help us look for a way forward and a way to get out of this mess that we have found ourselves in, but rather as a means to vent her frustration over the ever encroaching corporate and technocratic domination of our lives. The thing is that Penny doesn't actually say anything new in this book, and does not really point out anything that we don't already know, and there are much better books out there that do just that (such as Naomi Klein's No Logo).\tThe thing about the corporation is that there are two sides to every issue. Corporations are able to raise huge amounts of capital to be able to produce things that normal people like us are not able. They are also able to make life easier and to provide avenues for us to be able to get things that we like and need. Without the corporation we would not have supermarkets, or multiplex cinemas, or even the vehicle to get you to these places.\tOn the flip side, they have what is effectively unfettered power of control. Corporations control what we see and what we do. With the amount of money they are able to raise they are able to influence governments and elections. We have seen this recently in Australia where one media company pretty much dictated the election result by printing newspaper articles with views that they wanted people to see. For instance, opposition leader was pictured as the saviour that Australia needed while every move that the government made was plastered everywhere, and was given a negative twist (while this has been the case for a long time with elections, it has never been to this extent previously in Australia). Now, what we have is a government that is effectively secret and media shy, and bowing to corporate interests for what they believe is in the best interests of the country.\tThere is one thing that I have noticed that is coming out of this recent election and that is a law banning boycotts. This law is clearly aimed at promoting and protecting corporate interests and denying the citizens of Australia the right to freedom of speech. The question is how is this law going to be implemented. Am I going to be forced to eat at McDonalds, and am I going to be forced to do all of my shopping at one of the major supermarkets because if I don't it will be considered a boycott. Or is this law going to fall flat on its face because there is no way to actually determine whether a consumer's buying behaviour is a boycott or simply choice.\tAnother thing this book raises is the idea of the phone maze. I work in a glorified call center (meaning that we need to have decent training to be able to work where we are working) and the idea of the phone maze is to try and direct us to where we want to go. With the number of calls I make out, I encounter either the switchboard, or the phone maze. Having navigated lots of phone mazes, one becomes proficient in getting to where you want to go, or at least working out how to speak to a person because a computer simply has no intelligence and only responds to commands. Otherwise you hit the switchboard which, unless you are ultra-specific, they end up sending you to the wrong department anyway.\tOne thing that I notice in my workplace is how people are being forced to specialise. The work duties are slowly being narrowed down in the same way that the manufacturing sector has narrowed down the tasks that the workers perform. Before the industrial revolution, blacksmiths used to be multi-skilled, however now all you do is the same repetitive task day in and day out. The same is the case with office work, and with file management, as the specific tasks on each file are farmed out to specialists. Being somebody who likes variety in my work, and to be able to be challenged from multiple different sectors, this is something that I do not particularly like."], ["With the Western world choking on its own bullshit, watching things fall apart because we've believed our own lines, Laura Penny rides to the rescue, shovel in hand, to help us dig ourselves out.

I don't like synthetic perfumes. I don't like being bombarded by someone's overzealous application of scent. I don't like synthetic fragrance. (Every time someone tells me their homemade soap or perfume has \"only the best all-natural essential oil of banana/cucumber/lilac/fill in blank with any other synthetic scent masquerading as \"natural oil,\" I cringe. There is no such thing as cucumber EO.) Now, what I do like are things that smell good and are subtle. I like history. I like thinking about an everyday thing in a new way or understanding how something works and why. This is a book that likely receives both more praise and more criticism than it deserves, but how well one likes this book will depend on why one is reading it. It's neither a \"how to\" book nor a straight history, but it contains elements of both. Within the \"how to\" part, the author does much better with the explanation of how scent affects (most) people and how to approach the process of building a fragrance blend than she does the nuts-and-bolts of making a specific perfume. There are recipes, but they are either skewed to her preferences -- and she seems to be overly fond of floral and sweet scents-- or contain ingredients that are unlikely to be within the budget (or accessibility) of a hobbyist. Within the history part, she does a nice job of covering how alchemy and perfume-making are related, the history of using scents for ritual and pleasure, and the beginning of the perfume trade; however, don't expect to find the scuttlebutt about the big perfume houses or famous brands. Because I was reading it for entertainment and as a general history of fragrance, I enjoyed it. The author has a lovely writing style, sensuous and descriptive, although she comes off a little assumptive in a few spots. (No, everyone does not like rose or ylang-ylang and everyone does not like sweet powdery finishes.) The writing reminded me a little of Diane Ackerman's A Natural History of the Senses.I found her recipes the least interesting part of the book, but I understand that she is including them as exercises on how to train one's sense of smell. For me, the best parts of the book were the history of how fragrance has been used throughout various ages/cultures and the section comparing building a fragrance to composing music.

The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "Subtitled \"An Attempt to Appreciate Daniel Deronda\" this 1888 study, published in Germany by a Jewish scholar, praised Eliot's sympathetic understanding of Judaism in her novel.", "author": "David Kaufmann"}, "Perfumes, Splashes  Colognes: Discovering and Crafting Your Personal Fragrances": {"average_rating": "3.57", "review": [["Well, I officially don\u2019t get Tom Robbins. People have recommended him on the basis of comparisons to  Douglas Adams, but Adams is, you know, funny.

And here\u2019s the kind of prose you can look forward to:The sky, layered with thin altostratus clouds and smog, appeared to reflect human suffering and failed to awaken in Claude visions of paradise.

(Page 36)With the absence of the cloud cover that normally caused the sky over Seattle to resemble cottage cheese that had been dragged nine miles behind a cement truck, the city, for the first time in memory, would have an unobstructed view of one of nature\u2019s most mystical spectacles. (Page 47)When Claude glanced at the sky, he saw that the text of  Les Miserables had been painted over by Salvador Dali. The sun was so round and glossy and black that had it a figure eight on it, well, it would have validated a lot of long-standing philosophical and theological complaints, underlining once and for all just where we earthlings sit on the cosmic pool table. (Page 81)A few flat clouds folded themselves like crepes over fillings of apricot sky. Pompadours of supper-time smoke billowed from chimneys, separating into girlish pigtails as the breeze combed them out, above the slate rooftops. Chestnut blossoms, weary from having been admired all day, wore faint smiles of anticipation. (Page 201)And of course:Above Seattle, the many-buttocked sky continued to grind. (Page 312)And that\u2019s just me culling annoying descriptions of the sky. Imagine 350 dense, unrelenting pages of this crap. I never thought a book about immortality\u2014one of my favorite subjects\u2014could ever inspire in me such a desperate desire for it all to please just end."], ["Before I knew that magical realism was a thing, I loved Tom Robbins. Before I fell hard for postmodernism, I fell for Tom Robbins. Before I had developed a literary taste that I can be proud of, there was the beacon of hope for me that is Tom Robbins.There aren\u2019t many things I loved in high school that I still love now: Listening to the same Dashboard Confessional CD on infinite repeat, running to Livejournal to unselfconsciously document every oh-so-significant spike in my emotional temperature and wearing brightly colored tights under fishnet stockings are all things I\u2019ve let slip into the past but Robbins has seen me through all the milestones and minutia of my teenage and twentysomething years.Jitterbug Perfume was not my first foray into the weirdly wonderful and wonderfully weird worlds that Robbins builds from the gossamer threads of imagination unbound (I'm actually not sure which one popped my Robbins cherry but I do know I first read this one during my last summer of college when I was a live-in nanny -- which was a surprisingly good summer for bibliomania, actually). It is, along with Skinny Legs and All, tied for the honor of being my favorite of his, and both novels are longtime mainstays of my desert-island reading list. So when my craving for Robbins got to be too demanding to be delayed any longer and the heady of perfume of spring was calling too loudly for the only companion novel that successfully captured the power of scent in words, I knew I could rely on this book to deliver everything I needed and more.It is tempting (like, it is taking an inordinate amount of self-control to fight the impulse) to say something about how beets are the beating heart of this novel but that's only because I have a sick, unironic penchant for puns. Really, this is a story that spans 1,000 years (or about as long as I've been staring at the computer screen while waiting for this review to write itself C'MON BOOZE LUBRICATE MY THOUGHT PROCESS NOW) and connects Seattle to New Orleans to Paris to Bohemia of yore with the wafting of a fragrance. There's also a very loyal swarm of bees serving as the halo a modern-day Christ figure would wear and Pan comes and goes to prove that man creates and destroys gods with a fury and jealously no spiritual figurehead would ever dare to act on. And a fallen king who proves that love can last more than a lifetime and winds up behind bars in the process (if that's not a metaphor for modern times, I don't know what is). ...You know, I thought a little liquid creativity would help me here but it is just so damn hard to express how much and why I love this book and how excited I am that, almost eight years later, it is actually even better than I remembered. This is so much more than beautifully playful prose, a caution against taking oneself too seriously lest you forget to stop and smell the beet pollen, more inventively evocative metaphors than a whole hockey team could shake some really long sticks at -- just to mention a few of the things that established my seemingly eternal entrenchment in the Tom Robbins fan club so many years ago. That's not to say that I wasn't thoroughly tickled by those elements this time around but the more subtle aspects of the storytelling were what really got to me during this most recent reading.This book is a little disarming because it addresses so many issues, Big Ticket and otherwise -- life, death, love, immortality and the conflicted yearning for it, what happens on the other side of death, the individual vs. societal norms, the search for perfection, scientific pursuits, religion (and the lack thereof) -- in such a lighthearted, unexpectedly connected way that its moments of seriousness pack a brutal but enlightening punch. A character who triumphs over death for a good millennium is bound to lose more than he gains in his willful longevity, and his moments of introspective contemplation are a little hard to watch unfold, especially as some of the other characters are revealed to be carrying around the kind of sadnesses that compel them to keep moving; I can now appreciate that there is a definite Pynchonian element of contrasting goofiness of the highest order against some truly sobering sorrows to maximize the impact of each emotional extreme.I was a little worried that, like so many things I've outgrown, my love of Robbins's unique storytelling might now be a thing of the past tense. But he so intricately layers and pieces together so much in his books that there is plenty to notice for a first time (like how Jitterbug Perfume really does follow the format of a hero's journey, complete with help of and hindrances from mythical beings, a never-say-die determination to reach the finish line, the occasional occurrence of wine-dark liquids, and even a visit from a cyclops) and even more to rediscover anew."], ["post-read: Ohhhh, I really missed reading Robbins. What fun! This book was both more and less wonderful than I'd remembered. More because I'd forgotten just what a superb stylist Robbins is (see mid-read comments). His plots are intricate, his characters are rendered in wonderful detail, down to the distinctive vocal stylings. His ideas, though perhaps a smidge stale twenty-five years on, are still interesting and fun and clever and smart, intellectual, but not in a showy or pedantic way. Plus there's that anxiety you get when you're, oh, twenty or so pages from the end of a book, thinking There's no way he can pull it all together satisfactorily in so few pages! But he does! It's a tiny bit cheesy, maybe just a wee bit pat, but c'mon. He had an awful lot of balls in the air. Less for a few reasons. I'd kindly blocked out the fact that everyone in a Tom Robbins novel sooner or later launches into a discourse that sounds exactly like Tom Robbins, which can get pretty annoying. Also, I forgot how letchy he can be. There's a lot of sex in this book \u2013 in fact, it's one of the four pillars of immortality \u2013 which is fine; it's just that the descriptions of it are often a bit much. (\"Alma hiccupped the mushroom scent of his spurt,\" ex, not to mention lots of glistening, semen-encrusted thighs, and that sort of thing.) The other thing, which isn't really bad or good, exactly, is that I think Tom Robbins is kind of a victim of himself. He's too much Tom Robbins sometimes. Too hippie-clich\u00e9; too cerebral-in-an-understandable-but-trippy-way; too specific with his characters, to the point where they become caricatures that are hard to take seriously; even, sadly, too over-the-top with his metaphors (\"his knuckle began rapping at his eye patch like a mongoloid woodpecker drilling for worms in a poker chip\"? Are you kidding?); just too... too much. I guess taking a few years off between Robbinses allows one to forget these drawbacks just enough to come back to him fresh and be able to enjoy his shimmering originality again. mid-read: It's not that I'd forgotten, exactly, but no one does metaphors like Tom Robbins. For example: The sky was a velvety black paw pressing on the snowy landscape with a feline delicacy, stars flying like sparks from its fur. Fuck, really??pre-read: Last night I made the most amaaazing beet salad.

This book grabbed all my sense at the spin of the very first few words into the very first paragraphs:\nTHE BEET IS THE MOST INTENSE of vegetables. The radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity. Beets are deadly serious.Slavic peoples get their physical characteristics from potatoes, their smoldering inquietude from radishes, their seriousness from beets. The beet is the melancholy vegetable, the one most willing to suffer. You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip . . .\nThe epigraph introduced the themes of the story:The history of civilization is the story of man's emancipation from a lot that was harsh, brutish, and short. Every step of that upward climb to a sophisticated way of life has been paralleled by a corresponding advance in the art of perfumery. \u2014ERIC MAPLEANDThe distinctive human problem from time immemorial has been the need to spiritualize human life, to lift it onto a special immortal plane, beyond the cycles of life and death that characterize all other organisms. \u2014ERNEST BECKERAlobar would survive a thousand years and recount his adventures to the modern seekers of magical perfumes, botany and longetivity.\nAlobar, however, since, thanks to the Bandaloop, he had witnessed three hundred and eighty-five thousand, eight hundred and six sunrises in his life, and judging from the milky molluscan glow seeping through the barred window, was about to witness yet another.\nHowever, the moment he was devoid of the opportunity to exercise his own believes, the genes came calling:\nMore awake, actually, for the guards dozed over their detective magazines, dreamily musing about the long Thanksgiving weekend that was approaching, while Alobar was kept fully conscious by the smell of his body aging. Yes, he could smell it. During the first year of his sentence, he hadn't aged a notch. His body was still running on the impetus of a millennium of immortalist practices.With the exception of breathing techniques, he was unable to continue those practices in prison, however, and one day it dawned on his cellular bankers that the immunity accounts were overdrawn and there hadn't been a deposit in fifteen months. The DNA demanded an audit. It was learned that Alobar's figures were juggled. He had successfully embezzled more than nine hundred years.Outraged, the DNA must have petitioned for compensation, because within a week, Alobar's salt-and-pepper hair had turned into a pillar of sodium. Wrinkle troops hit the beaches under his eyes, dug trenches, and immediately radioed for reinforcements. Someone was mixing cement in his joints. Now, in his third year behind bars, he could smell, taste, and hear the accelerated aging going on inside him. It smelled like mothballs. It tasted like stale chip dip. It sounded like Lawrence Welk.\nThe prose was just so picturesque and descriptive that it was hard for me not to add even more quotes from the book\nTHE CARROT SYMBOLIZES financial success; a promised, often illusory reward. A carrot is a wish, a lie, a dream. In that sense, it has something in common with perfume. A beet, however . . . a beet is proletarian, immediate, and, in a thoroughly unglamorous way, morbid. What is the message a beet bears to a perfumer? That his chic, elitist ways are doomed? That he might profit from a more natural, earthy, straightforward approach? This beet, this ember, this miner's bloodshot eye, this apple that an owl has pierced, is it a warning or friendly advice?\nPostmodernism, magic realism, epic moments fill up this lengthy, too often dragging tale, bogged down by philosophical daydreaming and too much carnal moments for my taste, but the humor and the literary rhythms of the prose kept me reading.Alobar's tale spanned several continents and nine centuries. It is the story of perfume, of consciousness, of historical moments, of life and beet! This book was an ambitious undertaking that worked very well. It's not a book for everyone, but certainly leaves much to ponder in its wake. It was a slow read. But a very good one.One of my favorite quotes from the book:  Louisiana in September is like an obscene phone call from nature.I truly loved the experience. And now for more beet in the diet and the Bandaloop dances. I'm all set to meet up with Aljobar in my next life :-)Postscript in the book:ABOUT THE AUTHOR TOM ROBBINS has been called \u201ca vital natural resource\u201d by The Portland Oregonian, \u201cone of the wildest and most entertaining novelists in the world\u201d by the Financial Times of London, and \u201cthe most dangerous writer in the world today\u201d by Fernanda Pivano of Italy's Corriere della Sera. A Southerner by birth, Robbins has lived in and around Seattle since 1962.After reading this book, you will have to agree :-)) A friend recommended the book and curiosity got the better of me of course, but I'm glad I took it on."], ["Told to read this by my boyfriend who declared that I NEEDED to read this book to understand him, I am now disgusted and reconsidering my relationship. Ok, I'm kidding, but I take solace in the fact he read this book in high school.Oddly enough, my best friend also said this is her favorite book.Either I'm surprised to discover I'm a prude, or Robbins wastes way too much of a promising book on misogynistic fantasies of all women as nymphomaniacs who live and breathe to seduce and pleasure their usually significantly older male partners. The only relationship that didn't annoy me was between Priscilla and Ricki, and even that one was sexually focused. I don't mind reading about sex, in fact I rather enjoy it if done tastefully, but I feel that the overwhelming sexual descriptions took away from the substance of Robbins' ideas. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout most of it and was even embarassed when a man in a plane commented on my book choice, noting that another author he reads is \"like Tom Robbins if he had a heart.\" I give it two stars because Robbins is clever (maybe too clever) and funny and I feel that the ending made up for what was lacking earlier in the book. Or maybe I was just glad to be done with it."], ["The most glarin\u2019 failure o\u2019 the intelligentsia in modern times has been its inability to take comedy seriously. The above Wiggs Dannyboy quote sums up the experience of my first Tom Robbins novel. It was a wild, irreverent, intellectually challenging and most of all a \u2018fun\u2019 ride, a \u2018look up Chomolungma\u2019s skirts\u2019, a perennial search for \u2018the perfect taco\u2019, a quest for immortality and the meaning of life that tries to expose the connections between perfume, tantric sex, transcendental meditation, pagan rites and ballroom dancing ... oh! and beets. Of our nine planets, Saturn is the one that looks like fun. Of our trees, the palm is the obvious stand-up comedian. Among fowl, the jester\u2019s cap is worn by the duck. Of our fruits and vegetables, the tomato could play Falstaff, the banana a more slapstick role. As Hamlet \u2013 or Macbeth \u2013 the beet is cast. The beet, or mangel-wurzel, gets the royal treatment in the novel, put on an equal footing with ancient deities and with esoteric fragrances, granted deep philosophical significance and mysterious metahysical powers. Robbins lets his exuberance fly from the very first page in singing a paean to the under-appreciated vegetable. The introduction also serves as a weeding out device for starched-collar or thin-skinned readers who might be easily offended by the satirical attacks on widely accepted atitudes and religions. Speaking for myself, the intro had the opposite effect of drawing me instantly into the story. The beet is the murderer returned to the scene of the crime. The beet is what happens when the cherry finished with the carrot. The beet is the ancient ancestor of the autumn moon, bearded, buried, all but fossilized; the dark green sails of the grounded moon-boat stitched with veins of primordial plasma; the kite string that once connected the moon to the Earth now a muddy whisker drilling desperately for rubies. The story / plot itself turned out to be almost irrelevant compared to the flow of ideas and the gleeful deconstruction of \u2018serious\u2019 literature. Priscilla the genius waitress is working in a Mexican food restaurant in Seattle and in her spare time she experiments with the ultimate perfume. Her mentor, Madame Devalier, is also working on a new perfume in New Orleans, with the help of an alluring assistant named V\u2019lu and of a supplier named Bingo Pajama. Across the ocean, in the perfume capital of the world, Marcel \u2018Bunny\u2019 LeFever is experimenting himself with the olfactive revolution. Later in the book, the different strands meet again in Seattle at an institute researching longevity under a modern Flower Power guru named Wiggs Dannyboy and a German Nobel laureate named Wolfgang Morgenstern. If you think this was easy to follow, add an Argentinian accordionist, a secret Tibetan sect named the Bandaloop, a Saxon King named Alobar and an Indian low-caste woman named Kudra, mix in Albert Einstein and a scene borrowed from Dante\u2019s Inferno, extend the plot to cover several centuries, include an impromptu history of perfume from the ancient to the modern times and put the cherry on the cake with the foul-smelling god of anarchy, drunkenness and promiscuity \u2013 PAN. Then you might have an idea of the epic scope of Tom Robbins\u2019 novel. According to Priscilla, the genius waitress, an \u2018alobar\u2019 is a unit of measurement that describes the rate at which \u2018Old Spice\u2019 after-shave lotion is absorbed by the lace on crotchless underpants, although at other times she has defined it as the time it takes \u2018Chanel No. 5\u2019 to evaporate from the wing tips of a wild duck flying backward. Of this long list of characters, all of whom are relevant in the economy of the novel, the catalyst or core element is probably Alobar, whose timeline come first and who defines in the most simple words the eternal human dillema : sooner or later we all have to deal with the awareness of death. Alobar refuses to accept Death\u2019s supremacy and inevitablity, setting out to find the secret of immortality: I may be mad, but I prefer the shit of this world to whatever ambrosias the next might offer. and, Alobar, once king, once serf, now individual \u2013 have you heard of individuals? \u2013 free and hungry, at your service. My mission? Well, frankly, I am running away from death. Heading East from his native Bohemia, Alobar learns that freedom of choice equates also with danger and hunger, and meets in Greece with one of the old wise ones - The Great God Pan \u2013 who adds another piece or two to the puzzle of existentialism and free will: Come with me, Alobar, for while we must go forever in despair, let us also go forever in the enjoyment of the world. and, The gods have a great sense of humor, don\u2019t they? If you lack the iron and the fizz to take control of your own life, if you insist on leaving your fate to the gods, then the gods will repay your weakness by having a grin or two at your expense. Should you fail to pilot your own ship, don\u2019t be surprised at what inappropriate port you find yourself docked. Refreshed by the god\u2019s drink and by the lusty dryads hanging around Pan, Alobar continues to head East, reaching the roof of the world where at first he seeks refuge in a Buddhist monastery, only to discover that he very much prefers the material to the spiritual life. A young Indian woman helps him to make the decision, and from this point forward they will be a couple. Here they teach that much of existence amounts only to misery; that misery is caused by desire; therefore, if desire is eliminated, then misery will be eliminated. Now, that is true enough, as far as it goes. There is plenty of misery in the world, all right, but there is ample pleasure, as well. If a person forswears pleasure in order to avoid misery, what has he gained? A life with neither misery nor pleasure is an empty, neutral existence, and, indeed, it is the nothingness of the void that is the lamas\u2019 final objective. To actively seek nothingness is worse than defeat; why, Kudra, it is surrender; craven, chickenhearted, dishonorable surrender. By this point of the journey I have also became aware of a tendency towards preaching on the part of the author, but I enjoy so much his barbed style that he gets a free pass for more of the same: If desire causes suffering, it may be because we do not desire wisely, or that we are inexpert at obtaining what we desire. Instead of hiding our heads in a prayer cloth and building walls against temptation, why not get better at fulfilling desire? Salvation is for the feeble, that\u2019s what I think. I don\u2019t want salvation. I want life, all of life, the miserable as well as the superb. Yay!!! for Alobar and Kudra ! Reader, be prepared for some steamy scenes of enjoying life under the majestic Chomolungma. Robbins continues to fire up his aphorism gun: To eliminate the agitation and disappointment of desire we need but awaken to the fact that we have everything we want and need right now. ... making time for a sideswipe at those serious, gloomy, cynical high-brow authors, comparing them with Timolus, who  judging the music contest between Pan and Apollo, had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the Apollonian lyre, thereby establishing the tradition that critics must laud polish and restraint, attack what is quirky and disobedient, a tradition that endures to this day. I would propose Robbins is deadly serious in his comedy, coming down hard on the side of Pan and decrying the ways first Christianity, and later Pure Reason (Descartes and his disciples, according to Alobar) have taught us that life is pain and suffering. In this plea, Robbins sounds to me like a later day hippie, a more articulate but equally passionate supporter of a life among flowers and unrestriced love. The old god had endured severe setbacks in the past: the disdain of Apollo and his snooty followers, the rise of cities, the hostility of the philosophers \u2013 from Aristotle to Descartes \u2013 with their smug contentions that man was reasonable and nature defective, and, most damaging of all, the concentrated efforts of the Christian church to discredit his authority by identifying his as Satan. The arrogant attacks, the dirty tricks, the indifference had rendered him weak and invisible, and might have destroyed him altogether had not an unreasonable affection for him persisted in isolated places: hidden valleys and distant mountain huts; and in the hearts of heretics, lusty women, madmen, and poets. The same theme of the fight between Pan and Apollo is picked up later by Priscilla and Wiggs Dannyboy in Seattle, as they discuss Flower Power and French existentialism:-\t Seems to me that the so-called happy people are the ones who are trivial. Avoiding reality and never thinking about anything important.-\tReality is subjective, and there\u2019s an unenlightened tendency in this culture to regard something as \u2018important\u2019 only if \u2018tis sober and severe. Sure and still you\u2019re right about your Cheerful Dumb, only they\u2019re not so much happy as lobotomized. But your Gloomy Smart are just as ridiculous. When you\u2019re unhappy, you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself. And you get to take yourself oh so very seriously. Your truly happy people, which is to say, your people who truly like themselves, they don\u2019t think about themselves very much. Your unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up, because that means he has to stop dwellin\u2019 on himself and start paying attention to the universe. Unhappiness is the ultimate form of self-indulgence. Practising what they preach, Priscilla and Wiggs follow in the footsteps of Alobar and Kudra, learning to find happiness in self-expression and getting in touch with their animal side. (view spoiler)[ \u201cThey can have their loaf o\u2019 warm bread, their new-mown hay. Nothin\u2019 beats the smell of a lassie freshly laid.\u201d exclaims Dannyboy in post-coital bliss.  (hide spoiler)]Where does perfume come in, you might ask? Well, it\u2019s complicated! and while it might have something to do with disguising the bad smell of Pan, the disappearance of dinosaurs or reaching directly into our subconscious part of our brains, I believe it is better to let the Parisian specialist, Bunny LeFever, explain.  Perfume, fundamentally, is the sexual attractant of flowers, or, in the case of civet and musk, of animals. Squeezed from the reproductive glands of plants and creatures, perfume is the smell of creation, a sign dramatically delivered to our senses of the Earth\u2019s regenerative powers \u2013 a message of hope and a message of pleasure.  and, I have spoken to you this afternoon of poetry and of sexual magic. Not too many years ago, the names of our perfumes bore testimony to such things. There was a popular scent called Tabu, there was Sorcery, My Sin, Vampire, Voodoo, Evening in Paris, Jungle Gardenia, Bandit, Shocking, Intimate, Love Potion, and l\u2019Heure Bleue - The Blue Hour. Nowadays what do we find? Vanderbilt, Miss Dior, Lauren, and Armani, perfumes named after glorified tailors, names that evoke not the poetic, the erotic, the magic, but economic status, social snobbery, and the egomania of designers. Perfumes that confuse the essence of creation with the essence of money. How much sustenance can the soul receive from a scent entitled Bill Blass? Tim Robbins is preaching to the choir in my case, and he is guilty from time to time of becoming too enamored of his debating skills, ignoring the need for pacing, character development and an actual plot, but I am real glad I discovered him through the pages of this novel, reminiscent to me of the more \u2018serious\u2019 offers of another favorite author: Christopher Moore in \u201cLamb\u201d or \u201cSacre Bleu\u201d. I plan to read more of Robbins\u2019 books, and I hope they will be filled with the same extravaganza of satire and philosophy.Here are the rest of the aphorisms that I salvaged from my mangel-wurzel journey: If a person has an \u201cactive\u201d life, if a person has goals, ideals, a cause to fight for, then that person is distracted, temporarily, from paying a whole lot of attention to the heavy scimitar that hangs by a mouse hair just above his or her head. We, each of us, have a ticket to ride, and if the trip be interesting (if it\u2019s dull, we have only ourselves to blame), then we relish the landscape (how quickly it whizzes by!), interact with our fellow travelers, pay frequent visits to the washrooms and concession stands, and hardly ever hold up the ticket to the light where we can read its plainly stated destination: The Abyss. >><<>><< It\u2019s been a huge adventure, an exploration of possibility, the invention of a game and the play of the game \u2013 and not merely survival. >><<>><< So make your perfume, my friends. Make it well. Breathe properly. Stay curious. And eat your beets. >><<>><< Philosophers have argued for centuries about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but materialists have known all along that it depends on whether they are jitterbugging or dancing cheek to cheek. >><<>><< Theese dance she make zee blood happy, zee bones happy. I don\u2019t know how to explain eet, but theese dance she celebrate that we are not, you know, died already.  (Effecto Partido, the Argentine accordion virtuoso)>><<>><< Live by the heart if you would live forever!"], ["Tom Robbins is, to me, like the band Rush (I know this seems like I'm trying too hard, but honestly, this is the best analogy I can come up with & this is legitmately the first thing that came to mind): You like them ok, and even get a bit excited when they come up on the radio, but when you're grabbing CDs for your car, your copy of \"Moving Pictures\" somehow never quite makes the cut. That's how it is with me and Tom Robbins. Well written? Check. Interesting characters? Check. Unique? Double check. Glad I read the book? Check...But somehow this is all never enough to get me to grab his next book off the shelf. Robbins is one of my wife's favorite authors, and I can see why, but somehow his work just doesn't grab me on a long-term basis. Still though - great book.

This is my first Robbins so I don't know what his other novels are like, but we're talking about an exceptionally charismatic writer here. Robbins takes a bunch of ingredients totally unrelated to one another and makes a story that's as unique as it is brilliant. Beets, horny gods, perfumes, ancient and modern history, eternal life, philosophy and sex. Not the cheesy, romantic kind of sex, but the raw, primitive and full of body fluids one. These are the basic ingredients that he uses to make a story both unforgettable and dreamy. History-wise, Robbins has certainly done his homework. It seems like he knows what he talks about when it comes to ancient and medieval times. The icing on the cake was the masterful use of humor to communicate his rather heretic ideas about pretty much everything. And of course his depiction of the afterlife is simply genius. To make a long story short, this is great stuff which I'll definitely be checking out more of."]], "review_count": "3", "description": "Discover the joys of crafting your own unique and personal perfumes.

Booth"}, "Salmon of Doubt": {"average_rating": "3.92", "review": [["Readers beware: The Salmon of Doubt is not a single novel, but rather a collection of goods pulled from Adams' computer after his death--including a draft of the first few chapters of his next Dirk Gently story (also titled The Salmon of Doubt, thus the larger part of this collection's title). Also enclosed in this volume are a series of short stories, essays, travelogues, and other random snippets, some of which date back over a decade, and most of which have little to do with the next entry, except they were all written by Adams.How, then, to review this book? How does one go about commenting on a collection of miscellanea the author never intended to exist in single-volume form? How does one offer criticism on a draft of an unfinished novel? Indeed, how does one offer any insight into a bricolage of material that, pessimistically, smacks of the publishing industry's frantic attempts to make one last posthumous dollar off of a popular writer?I answer through a personal narrative. Any review ever published is, of course, subjective. This one is more so than even most. There's your grain of salt.My wife bought me this book for my birthday, and I took it with me when I flew home (alone; my wife wasn't able to accompany me) the next week to visit my parents. I read the entire book in one day as I shuffled between airplanes and ticket counters, fast-food stands and uncomfortable plastic seats. Much of what appeared in Salmon... was completely new to me, as I'd somehow never read Adams' shorter works--only his novels. But in short, I was both entranced and maddened: the former at the brilliant intelligence and humor that marble-streaked its way through the pages; the latter at the frustratingly incomplete Dirk Gently novel (imagine if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had only written the first half of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" before suddenly perishing, or if Shakespeare had never completed \"Romeo and Juliet\"). I saw in Salmon... sides of Adams both familiar to me, as in his intelligent satire, and unfamiliar, as in the extemporaneous and atheistic speech he delivered at Cambridge, sections of which forced me to close the cover temporarily while I pondered my own thoughts about the nature of God. Most importantly, through all of these scattered scribblings I saw the inner workings of a man who truly, admirably loved life. And as I turned the last page and stared helplessly at the blank sheet before me, and realized that I had just read the last \"book\" Adams would ever \"publish,\" I was overcome with a sadness so deep and painful that I've never yet been able to even pull Salmon... off of the shelf again, much less read it.Douglas Adams never knew I existed: we never met, exchanged correspondence, or even caught a glimpse of one another in a crowded airport. Yet I consider this man one of my dearest mentors, a man whose writing has shaped the last fifteen years of my life in areas too varied and extensive to number. How then to review a book like this? Simply put, I can't. I'm too close. Even now, five years after the only time I managed to read Salmon..., and six years after Adams' death, I'm too close.Why, then, do I give this book five stars?How could I not?"], ["It's really amazing the amounts of nostalgia that can build up in a person's system before it kinda explodes into a kind of reverse word soup full of interviews, introductions, epilogues, and snippets of novels we wish we had but they were never penned because the author up and died on us.I'm writing of Douglas Adams, of course. I almost didn't re-read this one because I remember it WAS mostly just magazine articles and interesting early computer-tech stuff and ruminations on science, god, and other random bits that fly out of this wonderful man's brain in tightly humorous one-liners that explain not only life, the universe, and everything, but also the way his mind works... and this is all DESPITE the fact that Mr. DNA may or may not have had a functional nose with which to sneeze out those humorous one-liners.So am I rating this entirely based on a man's ability to be clear, funny, horribly learned, and dead?Yes, but it's gotta be more than that, and indeed it is. I loved the man.I grew up reading and re-reading HHGttG about a bazillion times with or without the cheese sandwhich, playing countless hours on the Infrogames title of the same name being simultaneously corrupted and flabbergasted by my inability to create NO TEA, and learning how to fly by distraction.I even decided when I was fourteen that I'd grow a beard for the distinct purpose of giving some poor hapless creature a traveling burial site to not see the rest of the world through.DNA is that kind of man to me.This book reminds me of just how regular a human he is and it is an unabashedly wonderful nostalgia piece to boot. Oh, and we also get a few short stories including Ghengis Kahn, a non-presidential Zaphod, and the opening to the next Dirk Gently book which would have been fantastic, I'm sure, had he written it.*sigh*Still, what a wonderful thing it is. Farewell, Mr. Adams. (Yes. I know I'm 16 years late. It's just that this book was compiled shortly after his death, so I feel it fresh. Sue me.)"], ["I waited sixteen-and-a-half years to read this and I just about managed to get through it without bawling my eyes out. Douglas Adams was the first author to make me laugh uproariously, back when I was a wee nipper. Sure, Roald Dahl had given me a few chuckles, but it wasn't until I read Hitchhikers for the first time that I realised a book could make me laugh so much I nearly wet myself.As such, this was a bittersweet experience. Reading Adams' unpublished work, including several chapters of a new but never to be finished Dirk Gently novel, gave a new definition to laughing through one's tears. I'm glad I read it but it's going to take a while to recover. It's a good job I had my towel..."], ["This technically is the 3rd book in the Dirk Gently series. Sadly, it's not really a Dirk Gently book. You see, before Douglas Adams could write/finish this third book, he died of a sudden heart attack in a gym in Santa Barbara in 2001.But he left behind fragments of chapters or chapters and their rewritings and a lot of other notes on his various computers. His wife, daughter, agent, editor, assistant and other people then pieced together what is now The Salmon of Doubt which would have been the title of the third book.This book is divided into three parts:1) Life2) The Universe3) And Everythingwhich is a tribute to his Hitchhiker book(s).There is much more in this book than simply another story (or the beginning of one). The first two parts are filled with snippets, random thoughts DA wrote down about tea and cookies and computers and other stuff, interviews for various magazines and newspapers he did, as well as speeches he gave for all sorts of occasions.For example, did you know how much Douglas Adams got involved with environmentalism? Yes, this giant (literally) of a man did not just love all things Apple, but thanks to a trip done with biologist Mark Carwardine, he also became a staunch defender of bio-diversity. Most notably, he loved and tried to protect rhinos. He even climbed the Kilimandscharo in a rhino costume in order to raise money for \"Save the Rhino\" (a wildlife conservation organisation). Here he is:Naturally, it was much more of an ordeal than he had originally thought, which he explains in his very unique hilarious way (seriously, I almost suffocated when reading his account of that trip).My favourite story though is of the cookies. Here it is:This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I\u2019d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It\u2019s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here\u2019s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There\u2019s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There\u2019s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know\u2026 But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn\u2019t do anything, and thought, \"What am I going to do?\"In the end I thought \"Nothing for it, I\u2019ll just have to go for it.\", and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, \"That settled him.\" But it hadn\u2019t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. \u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2026\u201d I mean, it doesn\u2019t really work.We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.Typically British. And, strangely, or not so strangely because it's typical DA, a perfect anecdote about life.This book, therefore, grants a unique insight into the author's mind, his anxiety that sometimes bordered on depression, his early years and struggle, the sudden fame and success, the maddening battle with Hollywood, his private life even. And it shows how beloved and respected he was by family, friends and colleagues. I mean, Stephen Fry penned the Foreword and Richard Dawkins the Epilogue! Just the list of people he knew and often also how he got to know them is staggering.Alas, this is the end. So to speak. Fortunately, I can look forward to reading the 4 other Hitchhiker volumes as I haven't read those yet. It's amazing what kind of a legacy this man left behind (not just through his books, but also radio programmes, BBC contributions, movies, TV shows etc).Trigger Warning:This book is sometimes difficult to read; at least to those people who mourn the author, or generally feel for people who have to cope with sudden loss. It sure made me cry at certain points."], ["In early 1998 (or was it \u201897?), I experienced one of the most heady experiences of my life. A literary idol approached me at a conference we were attending in France (it was in Cannes, but it was a media festival rather than the more famous annual event), invited me to join him at dinner and debate the existence of God. Douglas Adams, self-proclaimed radical atheist, wanted to consider God\u2019s existence (or lack thereof) with me. As a minister, I\u2019d like to write myself in as the hero and claim that I at least put a dent in the famous atheist\u2019s armor. We had a fascinating conversation and I\u2019d like to think that I pushed him into rethinking his position, but that\u2019s not very realistic. Hang on! This does relate to this collection of Adams\u2019 writing in his last years, especially those reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt.In our discussion, I pulled out the well-worn rubber duck of apologetics. I told him that he was dishonest in calling himself an atheist instead of an agnostic. I didn\u2019t realize that this was the most offensive opening I could try. I hadn\u2019t read his interview with American Atheists where he asserted that Agnostic did not adequately express his position because he was \u201cconvinced that there is no God.\u201d (p. 96) But I blundered into the conversation with my classic approach that it is intellectual arrogance to claim to \u201cknow\u201d that there is no God by appealing to an illustration in one of Rudy Rucker\u2019s books on multidimensionality. This took my literary hero off guard because \u201cmultidimensionality\u201d was a great fascination for him. I told him that certainty of the non-existence of God might well be trying to decide a multidimensional issue via the limited dimensions we have discovered in our empirical science. Then, I conceded that being \u201cconvinced\u201d was different than \u201cknowing,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t objectively any better than a person of faith being \u201cconvinced.\u201d I scored the opening round a stand-off. I\u2019m not sure what Adams would have scored it. He must have been somewhat satisfied because he shifted gears.He told me that there was no rational need for the existence of God. This, of course, is a different question. Unlike my typical sermon, I opted to walk the tightrope of suggested that God is a useful concept\u2014EVEN (don\u2019t be horrified at my speculation, true believers) if a personal God didn\u2019t exist. I told him that I personally believe in a personal God, but for purposes of discussion, we should consider whether there really was no rational need for the existence of God. I asserted that, contrary to Adams\u2019 hero Richard Dawkins for whom I expressed admiration for his science and reservation for his assertions which went beyond the acceptable evidence, the idea of God was more helpful than harmful.Adams was skeptical (duh!) and attempted two analogies which I found interesting. He pulled some British currency out of his wallet and suggested that burning it wouldn\u2019t warm you, eating it wouldn\u2019t feed you, and wearing it wouldn\u2019t cover you, but that it had purchasing power because the state stood behind it. But, he suggested that you need the assurance that the state exists in order for the currency to have any effect whatsoever. I countered (maybe a feeble parry at best) that, for the bulk of the British population, they had no idea of the nature of money supply, national deficit, budget viability, and governmental oversight of that currency but had an essential faith in the government. One doesn\u2019t have to have all of the economics behind the currency explained satisfactorily in order to use the money. In the same way, one doesn\u2019t have to understand everything about God in order to benefit from the idea of God. Therefore, there may well be a rational need for God. Before I explain the next analogy, imagine my amazement to see the late 1998 speech from Adams that was reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt: \u201cMoney is a completely fictitious entity, but it\u2019s very powerful in our world; we all have wallets, which have got notes in them, but what can these notes do? You can\u2019t breed them, you can\u2019t stir-fry them, you can\u2019t live in them, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do with them, other than exchange them with each other\u2014and as soon as we exchange them with each other, all sorts of powerful things happen, because it\u2019s a fiction that we\u2019ve all subscribed to. \u2026if the money vanished, the entire cooperative structure that we have would implode.\u201d (p. 140) Did our discussion bear fruit? Adams didn\u2019t change his mind about the existence of God. He merely recognized the utility of the concept of God. Egotistically, I had thought to convince him one step at a time, but perhaps, I merely pushed him to fortify and develop his philosophical position to allow for a utilitarian (he called it \u201cartificial\u201d) God. The conversation was still stimulating, especially so when Adams began to expound about Feng Shui. Now, maybe I wasn\u2019t listening, but I thought he was expressing skepticism about Feng Shui, so I said that it wouldn\u2019t really make any different that he and I don\u2019t believe that dragons exist, but that the concept of the dragon may help people design more comfortable and functional living spaces even if no dragon ever sets foot in the dwelling (and presumably they would not). Therefore, I suggested that even if I was wrong about the personal God whom I serve, my life may be better and more meaningful as a result of my conceptual idea of God\u2019s involvement in my life. Now, admittedly, Adams\u2019 hero of evolutionary arrogance (Richard Dawkins) wouldn\u2019t concede this as said individual perceives the very concept to be harmful due to the fundamentalist extremes which have wreaked havoc in human history, but it seemed like the approach caused Adams to pause. Again, that could be arrogance on my part. I WISH I had impacted Adams and this could merely be wish-fulfillment. However, I was delighted to read on p. 146: \u201cYou figure out how the dragon\u2019s going to be happy here, and lo, and behold, you\u2019ve suddenly got a place that makes sense for other organic creatures, such as ourselves, to live in.\u201d Do I think I won a debate with this man who was, in so many ways, my intellectual superior? Naaah! I just like to think that our conversation pushed him in a direction he was already considering. Do I wish I could have convinced him of the existence of a personal God who cared about Him and wanted to be involved in his life and life\u2019s work? Absolutely! Do I still admire him as a person and his creative output? Absolutely!There were a few other lines that I really enjoyed in this book of essays, interviews, introductions to books, albums, and concerts, speeches, and rambling thoughts before I got into what I really procured the book to read, the last Dirk Gently story. I loved his line about art when he said, \u201cI think the idea of art kills creativity.\u201d (p. 158) And, I loved the story about his awkward experience in the train station with the cookies (pp. 150-151). It appears that he was sharing a table while waiting for a train. He had his coffee and a packet of cookies along with his morning newspaper. As he was reading his paper, the fellow reached over, opened the bag of cookies, too one out and began to eat it. Some British reserve kept him from confronting the man for his effrontery, so they actually ate the cookies in uncomfortable silence one-for-one. When the man left, Adams moved his paper and discovered an identical, but unopened bag of cookies under his paper. He was amused that he had thought so ill of the man while he was erroneously consuming the other man\u2019s cookies. And he knew why this had occurred, but the other man never discovered the punch line. In the U.S., of course, there would have been a loud vocal confrontation at the very least. As for the title piece, the bare-bones portion of the unfinished Salmon of Doubt, it was delightful\u2014even in its admittedly unpolished form. I followed the tortured logic of the cabbie who assumed that since people said, \u201cFollow that cab!\u201d in the movies and he, having had a long tenure as a cabbie had never heard that phrase, he must indeed have been the cab that all other cabs were following (pp. 249-250). I rolled my eyes with empathy when Dirk discovered a freezer cabinet full of \u201cold, white, clenched things that he was now too frightened to try to identify.\u201d (p. 226) I chuckled at the description of Gently\u2019s office that was \u201cold and dilapidated and remained standing more out of habit rather than from any inherent structural integrity\u201d (p. 238) I really loved the slam on typical airline personnel speak (Airline Syllable Stress Syndrome\u2014p. 253). I was sad that the book wasn\u2019t complete, even in its current form."], ["What a delight to revisit the mind of Douglas Adams. I like that this is a collection of emails, speeches, one-liners, and rants. Yes, there's the start of a novel in there, that he may or may not have intended to call the Salmon of Doubt. The result is so much better than it sounds like it's going to be: Douglas Adams died, but his buddy knew his password and emptied his Mac onto a CD, the various unfinished writings were lightly edited and printed as this. But gosh, am I ever glad that they did, because there's some exceptional writing in here, hilARious, as he always was, and glitteringly insightful. His projections on the future of technology, from the 90's, are pretty brilliant, and the piece de resistance is the speech to Cambridge on the purpose of God."], ["A collection of essays, speeches, ramblings unearthed on his hard drive(s), one short story culled from a BBC annual, and the titular unfinished Dirk Gently novel. The essays are breezy and witty, often lacking focus when discussing science and technology, but comprise (realistically) the most readable of his non-fiction output. There are some readers, yours included, who feel Adams spent himself on the Hitchhiker\u2019s books: although the Dirk Gentlys were absurdist romps sutured with awesome logic, they didn\u2019t hang together as novels. The short excerpt from The Salmon of Doubt, however, might prove me wrong: the usual warmth and humour is present, although in nascent form, (the narration even slips from third into first person, a sign of Adams\u2019s dissatisfaction). But all in all, nobody who loves Adams could resist reading this book, despite snoozing through the travel/nature pieces to get to the stuff they want. It\u2019s a pleasing gallimaufry. Savour it, because there is no more."], ["A kind of poor book which just happens to be filled with awesome. I'd really like a well-organized and indexed collection of all of Douglas Adams' short writings. Round up all the columns and editorials he wrote, the text he did for his websites, everything, and get it all tied up with a bow and some context. Salmon isn't that collection; the writings are just tossed into poorly-defined buckets with no real TOC to speak of (and let us not speak of indexes), and there's no real way to tell what's missing or what's even important. There's some occasional interesting serendipity to be had, but eh.On the other hand, it's Douglas Adams, bringer of joy and wry, good-natured English despair, and even inferior collections of his work are crucial."], ["If you love Douglas Adams this book is an absolute must read. It's got some great incite into the man who could make a pot of petunias think to itself, 'Not again.' A large part of my enjoyment was finding out about Adams as a person, and in turn finding out that I've got some stuff in common with him. I mean sure I haven't ridden a stingray like he has or written the funniest books of all time and granted I'm not British, BUT we do make our tea the same way, we're both have the same religious beliefs in our complete lack of having them (did you know atheists have conventions?

Heinlein was one of my first discoveries in science fiction once I moved beyond Tom Swift, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, along with Isaac Asimov, Keith Laumer and others. I still like \"Glory Road\", \"Starship Troopers\", \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", \"Sixth Column\", \"Citizen of the Galaxy\" and some of his short fiction. In one of his books (which one I've forgotten) he presented an alternate society how everything would work better under it. At the end of the book, he pointed out some of the problems with the society.That was an eye-opening, mind-bending experience when I was 12 or 13. I was a passive observer, a passenger, in my reading up to that point. That taught me to keep my left up while I was reading. I still enjoy the ride but I don't buy it all because someone wrote it.Heinlein and I parted company with \"The Number of the Beast\", a nonsense book, poorly written - I wondered if he'd sketched out the ideas for it and let someone else write it, like James Patterson does now. He never won me back after that.\"To Sail..\" is a continuation of RAH's Lazarus Long/Future History stories and the lead character is Long's mother. She wakes up in bed with a dead man and a cat, with no idea of how she got there. That's a pretty good hook for a story. So, RAH, tell me about it.Nope. The next 7 chapters are the joys of Maureen Johnson's sex life threaded around daily living in Missouri beginning in the 19th century. At page 122, I lost interest and started skimming and skipping, hoping to discover the plot. I failed.RAH has three basic characters, the Wise Old Man, the Naive Young Man (usually the protagonist and narrator), and the Hot Chick. I can deal with that, I don't read RAH for characterization. MJ is, of course, the Hot Chick (with some WOM through in).RAH has really gone to FantasyLand for this character. Hugh Hefner and Ian Fleming, whose detractors view them as prototypical chauvinist pigs, were never this extreme. Is MJ hot to trot? Always. Every tired or busy? Never. Second thoughts about where, when, position? None. Adultery? Why not, we'll both do it. Swapping? Sure. Group sex? Of course. Incest? It's good clean family fun. Sexual diseases? Only happens to other people. I'm not extrapolating, it's in the book.Really, RAH? Science fiction is a wonderful avenue to challenge accepted wisdom on society and mores. This book is the extended fantasy of a 15 year old boy who isn't getting any. It should probably have been explored thoroughly with a competent therapist, not printed as a book.The book checks RAH's standard repertoire: glorification of the military, libertarianism, liberals as the cause of the fall of civilization, evils of religion, education (usually hard sciences), cats, and firearms training.I used to think Heinlein was insightful. I liked his aphorisms, thinking they were the conclusions of the Wise Old Man. I recently found a statement that certainty is an emotion, not a logical conclusion. RAH has certainty by the bucketload.One and a half stars, rounded to two. Not recommended."], ["I have no doubt that there are many people who, knowing that I reserve the 5-star rating for books that I think must be read, will start to read this book (or read it entirely) and conclude that I have become simply a dirty old man. A glance at the other Goodreads reviews of this book will tell you why; the vast majority of them seem to give it a rating of one or two stars with passionate complaints about the sex in the book, the \u201chorniness\u201d of the first-person narrator, the lack of action (!), etc. A very few give it five stars, suggesting it perhaps was Heinlein\u2019s greatest book; put me in that latter category. I find myself absolutely amazed that I had no idea that this book existed until 24 years after its publication, and I only happened to notice it because one of the librarians displayed it on a shelf with its cover showing, depicting a voluptuous red-headed nude (with parts of her anatomy discreetly covered by her flowing red hair, standing in a very large clam shell (which has nothing to do with the story), accompanied by a cat sitting beside her (a cat sitting on his tail, by the way, despite the fact that he is repeatedly described as always having his tail pointing straight up).Many moons ago (52 years ago, actually) I attended a conference for technical writers in St. Louis, where the keynote speaker was an admiral who berated us all for writing boring technical manuals and demanded to know why we could not write manuals as interesting as Heinlein\u2019s novels. I happened to have a Heinlein pocketbook in my back pocket at the time, and it took all my self-control to prevent myself from leaping to my feet and yelling \u201cBecause he can write about sex, and we have to write about gizmos.\u201d I now think that anecdote shows the silliness of my youth; Heinlein did not write about sex\u2014he wrote novels in which one or more of the characters engaged in sex one or more times as part of the historical narration of the overall story, and that is just as true here as it was then. Yes, Maureen does have sex--with a teenage boy in her town, then with her cousin, then with some other boys and even a couple men, including her eventual husband, and later with friends \u2026 and eventually with her son and perhaps with a great-great-grandson or two--but the gross details of the acts, such as run rampant through all the trashy romances my eldest loves to read, are not given; it all happens between paragraphs, or even between lines. More to the point, it all happens over the course of a few thousand years, actually, and the real point of the story is to get from one end (early in the 19th century in Minnesota) to the other (God know when or where), involving time travel, multiple universes, extra-dimension cross connections, and the inevitable change of the human condition through all those years.The other chief complaint against Heinlein seems to be that he engaged in social engineering by promoting ideas different from those held by the majority of men. But isn\u2019t that true of all writers? I\u2019ve must finished other reviews of books by Charlene Harris, Anne Perry, and Patricia Cornwell, and I have to believe that their characters were being portrayed in such a way as to reflect the authors\u2019 ideas that we all should think differently about certain things. Harris shows that small-minded Christians cannot accept ways of life outside their own (such as vampires, werewolves, fairies, etc.); Perry is fascinated about the different and disparate ways of life of the rich and the poor, and Cornwell projects the hope that goodness and intelligence eventually must win out over the evildoers of the world. Heinlein himself maintained that all this prolific outpouring was not social engineering at all but just writing to entertain (and to sell).This was Heinlein\u2019s last book, published when he was dying at the age of 80. He had already established a practice of weaving his various different novels and stories together, and this one was simply a continuation and culmination of that same trend. It also requires a basic background understanding by the reader of various diverse concepts that had evolved in science fiction since he and John Campbell essentially created the genre back in the days of my childhood, as this novel ties a lot of them together. My parents would not have liked this book, and I have friends who would have no idea what it was talking about for most of its length.I was amused that one of the debunking reviewers proclaimed that he stopped reading the book half way through because there wasn\u2019t enough science-fiction (!) \u2026 while another protested that the sex scenes were described in clinical detail (!) \u2026 and another expressed strong objections about the unrealistic portrayal of women in Heinlein\u2019s writings. There can be no doubt that most of Heinlein\u2019s women (and particularly Maureen Johnson) were based on his second wife, Virginia, whom he truly loved throughout their long marriage. I was also amused to notice how many of the 1-star and 2-star reviews had misspelled words, incorrect homonyms, and totally irrelevant comments."], ["One of his last & about the worst book Heinlein ever wrote, in my opinion. It's long, wordy & without much to recommend it. There is some action in it, but it's buried in windy passages. Not worth a re-read & I only got through it because I'm such a fan of his other works. Again, he is promoting incest."], ["Among Heinlein's last books, \"serious\" fans aren't quite sure if he was going insane in his old age, or if this book was meant as a sort of wink-wink nudge-nudge self-parody. In any case, it's pretty terrible."], ["Wish I hadn't bothered; this book is terrible. The thesis (oft-repeated) seems to be \"Maureen is an amoral wench,\" and this is backed up by pages and pages of her sexual exploits. In between the incest and polygamy is nonsense about alternate timelines and an assassination squad. All this is tied back into other novels like Time Enough for Love, and since it's told from a different perspective (Maureen's), hard core Heinlein fans will enjoy some of it. But ultimately it's only a few excellent paragraphs on the folly of \"warm body\" democracy, paper money, and bad parenting that make up the book's redeeming qualities."], ["Oh dear. What to say about this book? If you're thinking about reading it, be warned that there is a LOT of incest and I mean a lot. If Heinlein's evil plan was to overcome our natural 'phobia' of incest by repeated exposure then he may have partially succeeded because by the end I really didn't care any more whether Maureen slept with her father/son/whatever. If his plan was to write a good book then I think he might have failed. I found myself plodding through this but unwilling to give up altogether. I'm not particularly prudish and if everyone involved is a consenting adult then I have no objections to any sort of sex really. The issue of consent is pretty much absent here however, so I'd have to say that this bothers me more than all the incest. For instance one of Mo's friends casually tells her that she 'gave her cherry' to a man 3 times her age when she was 12 or so. Sorry Bob, but in my book that's child abuse. Maureen also regularly comments that one can easily avoid being raped by taking a few precautions. Talk about blaming the victim. Heinlein might have thought he was making some important statement about sex and morality but really he follows a very patriarchal model where the ideal women wants lots of sex all the time with any old man and a woman with other ideas is a freak. From a modern perspective Heinlein is actually extremely old-fashioned in his values. Have sex with your father/brother/cousin? Sure, nothing wrong with that. But you have to get married and you definitely can't be gay. Cos homosexuality is weird. Then there's the patriotism. Anyone who doesn't want to take up a gun to defend the good old US of A is a despicable coward. Perhaps all this would have been forgiveable if the book was any good. Unfortunately it wasn't really. The back story of how Mo came to be telling this story is very thin and puzzling. The story itself doesn't have much going for it. There's not much sci-fi. The characters are pretty flat and inexplicable. The idea of all these people living forever and going around fiddling with time-lines is quite unpalatable."], ["WARNING: Please read Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Revolt in 2100, Methuselah's Children, Time Enough for Love, The Number of the Beast, and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls prior to reading this. A familiarity with the \"future history\" stories are also recommended. Maureen Johnson, born in 1882 and mother of Lazarus Long, is one horny gal. This is her memoirs, told to us while being held in a jail on some unexplored timeline. Let me just say straight off that if you have a problem reading about incest, you should probably skip this (and the rest of the World as Myth series as well). If you can get over that, you'll find Maureen's life pretty interesting, sort of a rounding out of what we've been told before about Lazarus' mother and grandfather. The reasons for the jail cell and the eventual climactic rescue of...someone... cap the book, but I think deserve to have been a little better explained. This isn't my favorite of Heinlein's books, but it is his last full-length novel and the \"end\" of the World as Myth Series, so I recommend you read it if you've gone that far. It's also a (very) little better as a standalone than the two previous World as Myth books."], ["** spoiler alert **\n           Oy. I should have quit while I was ahead with this series.Well, \"series\" is a misnomer. Heinlein wrote several books in a row which were connected through both characters and concepts, but they were disjointed in their style and focus. But no matter what you call them, this book is the last one. I think. I am willing to be corrected.It tells the whole saga of Lazarus Long and The World as Myth all over again, but this time through the eyes of his biological mother, Maureen.And one of his wives, Maureen. Same lady.Look, I'm not a prude. I swear. But at some time in the series/non-series I felt badly that I was still squicked over the concept of incest. Oh, I understand that the technology was sufficiently advanced to guarantee no genetically screwed-up children... and I understand that their society was sufficiently advanced enough that there was no such thing as jealousy and everybody could love and sex-up everyone else and be one big happy family no matter if the one you were sexing up was your daughter or grandmother or son or whomever. Fine. But ... I can't get over my personal feeling that incest is a step too far; that the protective, nurturing relationship between parents and children should not become sexual. And I felt like an awful, close-minded, backward, prudish jackass for STILL feeling that way after I was done with the books. They all sort of hit one over the head with that message: you ARE an awful, close-minded, et cetera if you don't think it's a beautiful thing that one of the child-producing couples in the huge, multiple-partnered, immortal Long family is a mother and son.While a lot of the book was interesting, though-provoking, and well though-out, and while I always love Heinlein's writing (hence the three stars,) the interesting and engaging story kept being interrupted by incestuous orgies through the ages. At one point, I just flipped through the middle of the book and read a sentence randomly. It was a father in the 1910's deflowering his daughter. Whee.If you're interested in this sort of thing, or have read the rest of the books in the series, I would recommend this book. I love many of the characters, and the multi-universe concept is simply beautiful. Just remember you have to wade through siblings porking each other to get to it."], ["Sometimes this ties for fave with Stranger in a Strange Land, but most of the time this one wins. It's actually a pivotal book in the Lazarus Long series, because it deals with his mother and his origins. Frankly, I find Maureen, his mom, about a million times more interesting than Lazarus himself. This book was really forward thinking in portraying a smart, capable woman who really, truly pursued what she wanted in life, and was kind and even-handed in doing it. Maureen is a real role model in a lot of ways. The one downside into recommending this (or any other Heinlein book for that matter) is the sheer amount of sex in them. He doesn't write sensual books; all the situations are described obscurely or used to illustrate something else but they are undeniably sexy and sometimes very forthrightly. This book also deals with the idea of polygamy, open relationships, and incest, all in very positive terms (Heinlein tends to use human biology and science to explain his position on open, honest sexuality and commune-like communities). In this book, the sex is actually a major plot point, in that it is a theory of encouraging people genetically disposed to long life to marry and procreate to extend the human lifespan over generations. Perhaps with current science it seems a bit simplistic but it's very believable in the book. It also, like all his books, deals with time travel as well.

The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "A complete jazz chronology, ESSENTIAL JAZZ: THE FIRST 100 YEARS, 2e, delivers a thorough and engaging introduction to jazz and American culture.

The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "556", "description": "George Eliot\u2019s final novel and her most ambitious work, <b>Daniel Deronda</b> contrasts the moral laxity of the British aristocracy with the dedicated fervor of Jewish nationalists.

The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "2", "description": "Excerpt from Daniel Deronda, Vol. 1 <br />But while every single player differed markedly from every other, there was a certain uniform negativeness of expression which had the effect of a mask - as if they had all eaten of some root that for the time compelled the brains of each to the same narrow monotony of action. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

If you count appendixes and notes (and why wouldn't you when the appendix and notes matter?). I once teased my wife, during my early wooing stage, that I wanted to write an ode to every hair on her head (loads of odes). Garry Wills did. This book is both academic criticism (one chapter is infused with new historicism, one is textual criticism, one is formalist, one is mythological) and an ode to Lincoln, Language, and this damn fine speech. I could see Garry Wills publishing each chapter in some well-funded Civil War journal and eventually weaving each paper together. I'm not sure how it really happened. Wills might just have used the chapters and forms of literary criticism as an organizational framework. I am not going to do an exegesis on the book to find out. That would be far too meta. Anyway, it was a quick and fascinating read and significantly deepened my understanding of Lincoln's motives for the speech while also acting as an Entmythologisierung* of the text. No. Lincoln did not write the text on the back of a napkin while on a train TO Gettysburg. Anyway, a must read for those who love history, the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, or Transcendentalism.* I'm using the German here as a joke, since there were several instances when Wills referenced Everett bringing back the seeds of Transcendentalism and higher criticism from his studies there. I'm also using it because it is 1.5x as fun as just saying demystification."], ["Lincoln was a \u201cradical\u201d in both senses: he broke with tradition by returning to the roots. The heart of Wills\u2019s book is Lincoln\u2019s elevation of the Declaration of Independence as a transcendental text above the earthly and provisional Constitution. The Constitution, with its tolerance of slavery, was felt by Lincoln and other transcendentalist political thinkers to require renewal by the Declaration, whose unequivocal proposition of equality for all constitutes the moral center of the American system, the American Idea in timeless and transcendent form. (Lincoln, like Emerson, was very much concerned with the ebb and flow of spiritual life in and out of established institutions.) Wills argues that we owe to Lincoln our sense of a Constitution vividly informed and regularly amended by the people\u2019s progressive approximation of a transcendent ideal. Wills also kicks over a few rocks to show us the judicial conservatives, \u201cstrict constructionists\u201d and Neo-Confederate ideologues\u2014Americans hostile to America\u2019s founding ideals, statistically inevitable dregs and degenerates\u2014who to this day begrudge Lincoln for making universal equality integral to the peoples\u2019 conception of their Constitution. American bigots and subjectionists hate that there\u2019s a potent liberation ideology built into the system. That must be so annoying.The polished pearl of Lincoln\u2019s constitutional thinking, the Gettysburg Address is also, of course, a funeral oration Lincoln delivered at the cemetery where 3,512 Union soldiers killed at the battle of Gettysburg are buried, and therefore it has its fascinating social-literary situation in \u201cnineteenth century oratory, funerary conventions, and the poetry of death.\u201d The Address\u2019s birth-death-rebirth imagery and rhetorical reliance on antithesis, its brevity, abstraction and dense concision, show Lincoln consciously imitating the Athenian funeral oration, the Epitaphios Logos most memorably delivered by Pericles after the first year of the Peloponnesian War (Wills even writes of the Address as having \u201cthe chaste and graven quality of an Attic frieze\u201d). I love seeing American usage and institutions springing from the deep humanist culture of its founders and re-founders. The founders feared direct democracy, and focused their humanism on the Roman Republic; nineteenth century Americans preened themselves as heirs of democratic Athens, made Greek Revival the first truly national architectural style, and were, like much of Europe, enthralled by the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottomans. Edward Everett\u2014the main event of the Gettysburg ceremony, not Lincoln\u2014was \u201cthe voice of fashionably Romantic Hellenism\u201d who had made his career speaking at fundraisers for Greek independence and delivering Periclean orations at Revolutionary War battlefields.  The location of the Athenian Kerameikos outside the city walls, in precincts of contemplative rusticity, near the groves of the Academy, inspired the \u201crural cemetery movement\u201d across America, a movement of which the Gettysburg National Cemetery is a famous product (others are Boston\u2019s Mount Auburn, which drew 30,000 visitors a year; and Concord\u2019s Sleepy Hollow, whose dedication Emerson delivered). The Greek rural cemetery\u2019s \u201cpantheistic identification of dissolution with initiation,\u201d and the Greek view of patriot graves as ideal educative sites for the young caught on with nineteenth century Americans for a variety of reasons: 1. The waning of traditional religion before the Transcendentalist cult of nature (the \u201ctheological gloom\u201d of the churchyard and the cathedral vault exchanged for picturesque open-air sublimity, landscape-as-church). 2.The necrophiliac aspects of Romanticism, and the Romantic association of melancholy with genius, mourning with profundity (Lincoln\u2019s law partner Herndon: \u201cHis apparent gloom impressed his friends, and created sympathy for him\u2014one means of his great success\u201d).3. The limnality fetish\u2014s\u00e9ances, spirit photography, dead babies with angel headstones (Mary Lincoln conducted s\u00e9ances in the White House, and later had a spirit photograph taken in which the ghost of her assassinated husband leans over her protectively).

[image error]"], ["Just a beautiful piece of work that is also possibly the best book I've read on Abraham Lincoln. For one, Wills does a wonderful job of analyzing Lincoln's influences, from the Transcendentalism of Emerson and Theodore Parker to the oratory of the Greek revival movement to Romanticism, and all of it is so lucidly described and densely packed together that I often had to put the book down to absorb it all or think on it for a moment. Wills' main point though is that the Gettysburg Address, by making the Declaration of Independence America's most important \"founding document\" (written four score and seven years before 1863), and by substituting the aspirational call for equality made in the Declaration for the fuzzy compromises made in the Constitution, helped craft America as an international and on-going project for human betterment, rather than a local and limited one, and in so far as this speech reshaped generations of Americans' views of their country and its founding, Lincoln truly succeeded in ensuring a \"new birth of freedom\" for the nation. Overall it's a well-wrought description of the political and intellectual life of mid-nineteenth century America, one which also shows how a single genius managed to reshape that life going forward."], ["This year my \"Reading Challenge\" is to re-read 10 books to see how they hold up to my memory. There is quite a bit in this book that I forgot over 15 years.If you asked me last week, I'd have told you it was about the use of rhetorical devices and how this style of oratory harkens back to the Greek tradition. I would not have remembered nor told you it shows how Lincoln recast the meaning of the war and fixed the Declaration of Independence as subordinate to Constitution (as noted in the title); nor would I have remembered how Wills shows the influence of the transcendentalists on Lincoln's thinking; nor would I have remembered much about the choice of venue.Wills defines the founding generation's preference for Roman (a republic, fearful of the masses) imagery to the late nineteenth century's preference for Greek (a democracy with more suffrage) imagery. He shows the development of Lincoln's mood and thought through previous speeches and bits of Lincoln's poetry and a discussion of the (later) second Inaugural Address. There is quite a bit on the 19th century American experience of death (using the word \"Victorian\" only as an adjective for authors) and the cemetery movement.I remembered that by not naming a person, the battlefield being dedicated or the battle fought there, \"the North\" or \"the South\" or any place, or even the Declaration of Independence which the oratory is about, he makes the piece timeless. By using nouns instead of referent pronouns he creates stirring images. By using of balance he makes it poetic. I did not remember how the war was recast in that \"the great task before us\" is not emancipation, but the perpetuation of self-government.It's funny how the memory works. There are a few poems that Lincoln wrote and I did not remember any of them. Most of them are forgettable, but the poem on pp. 92-93 where Lincoln lays out his beliefs on race should not have been.The contrast with oratory of its day is shown in the Appendix III in the speech delivered that same day by Pennsylvania Governor Everett. Also in Appendix III is an example of the Greek funeral oratory from which the style is derived.Were I to have rated this book last week, I'd have given it 5 stars. While it is an important book and Wills brings a lot together, today I see it as a 4 star book. While the book is short and it is not pithy. The pieces on psychobiography and the section on the transcendental influence ramble."], ["An interesting and scholarly book on Lincoln and his speech at Gettysburg. Great information, but a bit dry at times. I appreciate this book's importance to USA History and can see why it won a Pulitzer."], ["This book is great. It's elegantly written, well-argued, well-documented and full of insight and information. Wills not only explains Lincoln's rhetorical techniques, he situates them in the context of classical rhetoric (in particular the ancient Greek funeral-for-heroes speech), American cultural trends of the mid 1800's (in particular Transcendentalism and the \"rural cemetery\" movement), and Lincoln's own history as a writer and giver of speeches. Most importantly, he demonstrates how Lincoln used the address to promulgate his philosophy about the nature of the political Union that is the United States of America. Lincoln believed that the American people had decided that they were one people, one nation, at least as early as 1776, and emphatically proved they were with the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution. In Lincoln's view, the 1787 Constitution did not make the Union; it only made the already-existing Union (in the words of the Constitution's preamble) \"more perfect\". The Union was \"given birth\" by an idea, and its ideal was spelled out in the Declaration. The Constitution is nothing more or less than an imperfect attempt to make that ideal reality, subject to political constraints at any point in time. Seen in this light, the stirring last sentence of the Gettysburg Address is more than a clever Jedi mind-trick to arouse patriotic fervor, it's a rebuttal to every kind of \"States' Rights\" revisionistic history, and a succinct statement of what the Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg were all about. The speech itself truly is a masterpiece, and Wills's book is equal to the task of explaining why and how this is so. Highly recommended."], ["Wills takes us back not only to the day that Lincoln gave this speech, but also he starts off crafting deftly, and laboriously, our experiences while visiting a cemetery such as this one. That realm between the living and the dead should be used to remember and commemorate those that have fallen so that we can finish the work before us. Our work to reinvent the Union should be founded upon giving new meaning to \"all men are created equal.\"Also, Wills explains how revolutionary Lincoln's Gettysburg address really was. And he proposes why it was so short, and also why so much was left out of it... like the words \"slavery\", \"the South\", or even the word \"Union\". And finally he examines how the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's Second Inaugural are so similar, and why the \"sin of slavery\" was not part of the Gettysburg Address but was able to be included in his Second Inaugural.If there ever was a book that I should reread, this is one of them."], ["There's a lot of junk by Gary Wills that I don't like, but I enjoyed this book enormously. Even more useful than Wills' gripping discussions of Lincoln's address, is the inclusion (in the appendices) of texts by Edward Everett, Gorgias, and Thucydides."], ["This was a very scholarly Pulitzer Prize winning book about Lincoln and the greatest speech in our nation\u2019s history. I memorized this speech in school but this author gives understanding to this short speech. In this book, the author examines the speech in minute and exacting detail. He analyzes Lincoln\u2019s influences from the Transcendentalist of Emerson and the Greek oratory of Pericles. And he examines the place, the Gettysburg cemetery where the speech took place. With this speech, Lincoln succeeded in a \u201cnew birth of freedom\u201d for the nation. I can appreciate why this book received the Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction. His inclusion of the appendices and text by Edward Everett was very useful in the understanding of the discussion and completeness in the understanding of this important speech and this important time in our nation\u2019s history."], ["This book contains so much interesting information about Lincoln and his speeches, but I can't say I really enjoyed reading it.

Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation \"a new birth of freedom\"--by tracing its first birth to the Declaration of Independence (which called all men equal) rather than to the Constitution (which tolerated slavery). In the space of a mere 272 words, Lincoln brought to bear the rhetoric of the Greek Revival, the categories of Transcendentalism, and the imagery of the \"rural cemetery\" movement. His entire life and previous training, his deep political experience, went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece. As Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel has been restored to its bold colors and forgotten details, Garry Wills restores the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln at Gettysburg combines the same extraordinary quality of observation that defines Wills's previous best-selling portraits of modern presidents, such as Reagan's America and Nixon Agonistes, with the iconoclastic scholarship of his studies of our founding documents, such as Inventing America. By examining both the Address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew and reveals much about a President so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world, to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns. The Civil War is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Now Garry Wills explains how Lincoln wove a spell that has not, yet, been broken.", "author": "Garry Wills"}, "A.

Like the previous book before it, it focuses on one character in each book so you can see how each character grows and changes over time.Katie is still not over the tragic death of her boyfriend Timothy who was killed in a car accident. Ever since Katie has these attacks where she has a feeling of unreality and a sense of panic and like she is going to die. Her good friend Freeman is the one who tells her it is panic attacks and helps her get over them.Over time her and Freeman draw closer and a romance starts to brew. There is one hitch, there is a woman who wants Freeman for herself. I felt that the love story in this books was authentic and relatable. You could see where each character was coming from and it was easily to become emotionally invested in the outcome. You find yourself rooting for Katie all the way.Like the previous book this book provided insight into the Amish lifestyle which I enjoyed. It even has some Amish vocabulary words and refers to the things that the Amish would. It also does not gloss over difficulties such as a woman spreading gossip about Katie which we can all relate to.This is a book that I would recommend to anyone wanting to get a glimpse into the Amish way of life and for those looking for a sweet inspirational and or romance.This review was originally posted on Adventures in Never Never Land"], ["While reading the novel Treasure Island, the author displayed different themes through each events.

Deidre Laiken is trying to tell readers to enjoy and have an adventure while reading this book because you can relate to the certain things that Jim goes through and become interested in setting your own experience of life. This demonstrates that the author wants readers to keep wondering what's going to come next because in every adventure you always have to expect the unexpected. The various events that occur in the novel shows how the author relates it to the real world. For instance, this whole novel takes place in the eighteenth century, when pirates were known.

The adaptation succeeded very well, and might even have been better than the book. The characters were very credible and their words and actions explained their circumstances perfectly. But there was a voiceover which I thought was unnecessary since the faces of the actors were very expressive and the dialogues filled in any missing background information. Soon afterwards, I watched the first episode of a three-part adaptation of Daniel Deronda, and had the opposite reaction. Nothing made sense to me. I was convinced that a large part of Eliot's intentions for the story were missing, and while the actors were all fine in their way, the words they were given to say were simply not enough. I tried to fill in the missing bits myself but couldn't - it was impossible to imagine the history and motivations that lay behind those characters and their actions, as impossible as trying to imagine the layers of messages underlying the movie title Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri until you've viewed that extraordinary film for yourself - which I've just done. If there had been a book on which that film was based, I'm certain that it could never measure up to the movie. Every frame was a billboard in itself, and the message on each was astonishingly spare and incredibly eloquent.George Eliot is very eloquent, but there is nothing spare about her writing. You cannot pare it down and fit it in movie frames yet it is very visual for all that. It belongs on the page but offers the big screen experience to the mind's eye. You just have to read all the words to see the pictures properly. I was very glad I abandoned the TV adaptation after that first episode and picked up the book instead. Right from the first page I realised that without the support of the text I could never have succeeded in fully understanding the complexities of motivation that lay behind the surface story, or indeed the scope of Eliot's project in the first place. And when I reached the end of the book, I was certain that I didn't need to watch the rest of the TV adaptation - the book had been more vivid for me that any adaptation could be. I posted an update the day I finished the book, regretting that the reading experience was over, and a curious conversation erupted in the comments section of that update (comment #17 onwards). The conversation made me realise that there are readers who tackle books as if their task was to adapt them for the screen rather than simply read what is on the page. They would like to cut massive sections, delete certain characters altogether and make other characters act differently so that the story might move towards an ending they think is more fitting. You could say that such an approach is a very 'creative' way of reading but you could also wonder where the writer's intentions for her work fit in that scenario. The writer's intentions are everything for me. I may probe them and question them sometimes but I would never disregard them. A writer's work is a sacred thing, a bit like other people's religious beliefs, not to be tampered with even when we don't revere them ourselves. I mention religion because it is a major theme in this book. George Eliot seems to have become more and more interested in Judaism during the course of her life, at first in an effort to overcome her own prejudices towards the increasing Jewish population in mid-nineteenth century Britain, and then later because she had become genuinely interested in the common origin of Judaism and Christianity. This book is essentially about that preoccupation but because Eliot is very good at creating story lines, she has inserted the Jewish themed story into an intriguing frame story. Readers seem to differ about which story is the more worthwhile part of the book, and many favour the frame story. However, I found that the two strands overlapped and echoed each other so well that I never even thought of separating or comparing them. Characters from both sections mirrored each other even if they seemed completely opposite, and the central redeemer-like figure of Daniel Deronda linked them all together perfectly. The overall shape of the book worked very well for me and I'm left in awe of George Eliot's mind as well as her writing. The result of this unplanned reading adventure is that Daniel Deronda now marks the beginning of my 2018 George Eliot season. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books, and I may possibly reread Middlemarch as a fitting endnote. So much for the to-read stack I selected at the beginning of January. Abandoned indefinitely! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Because I've a keen interest in Henry James, and I know he admired George Eliot's writing, I was interested to spot what might have been the germ of his inspiration for The Portrait of a Lady. Eliot's frame story concerns a fiercely independent-minded young woman who, in spite of the general expectation, is in no hurry to marry anyone. Nevertheless, like HJ's Isabel Archer, Gwendolyn Harleth finds herself enslaved by a cold-hearted husband who is only interested in crushing her independent spirit. It seems to me that Henleigh Grandcourt and HJ's Gilbert Osmond have a lot in common.Eliot's main story also reminded me of another Henry James plot line. I think Daniel Deronda could have been an inspiration for Hyacinth Robinson in Princess Casamassima. They are both orphans who desperately need to discover more about their parents, and they both become deeply involved in movements they had no previous associations with. Slim connections, perhaps, but I love finding such links."], ["THE DIPTYCH\nThis novel was renewed my interest on how George Eliot wrote. I am highly tempted to read more about her and approach literary evaluations of her writing, but before I do so I want to read Adam Bede and Silas Marner and may be reread The Mill on the Floss.When I read Romola I considered GE\u2019s cosmopolitanism and breath of knowledge. These elements are also present in Daniel Deronda but with an added edge. With Middlemarch it was the role of the narrator and the clear presence of the author that attracted me. In DD the voice of the writer is also clear but in less authorial fashion and, one suspects, speaking more often through her characters. What struck me most, and want to select for my review this time, is the structure of the novel. It is clearly divided in two. Clearly a diptych. Already MM seemed to me to consist of two parallel stories joined somewhat seamlessly in the middle. The study of provincial evolved around two foci, the doctor Lydgate and the illuminated Dorothea. Both idealists. The twists and turnings of the plot, however, managed to link the two stories creating a middle path in Middlemarch were these two different versions of dreamers confronted each other and helped each other in correcting their reflections.This double structure is again present in Daniel Deronda, GE\u2019s last novel, but with a wider gap between the two panels. With almost separated frames the novel reads like a double portrait, or a diptych with two facing and complementary donors searching for an object of adoration that is however missing \u2013 for the Self is never in the other. The two subjects pursue their mirroring images and transverse their separating frames by engaging in dialogs and verbal encounters. The twists and turns of the plot this time do not fuse their separated worlds. Only their minds bridge the gap.Generally I do not discuss characters in my reviews, but I can't avoid it this time. In this novel, the two protagonists, the sitters in the double portrait, baffled me. Gwendolen (Gwen), potentially a highly irritating young woman, fascinated me because I thought she was such a modern character. I expected that young powerful women in today\u2019s professional world, and who are not just capable and intelligent, but also beautiful\u2014and I am thinking of top Wall street traders, or international lawyers of the type, of for example, Amal Aladdin--, must have a similar self-assurance and defiance and inner drive and independence and \u00e9lan as Gwen. But even if these contemporary women have had a better chance to explore and exploit their abilities in their chosen fields of excellence than GE has allowed Gwen, she did not get on my nerves. I was enthralled by her modernity. Daniel, in spite of having claimed the title of the novel, remained for me an equivocal figure. It is almost as if in my diptych Daniel\u2014with his messianic role turned around, for he is the Christian leading onto the Jewish\u2014 is a donor who through a process of transubstantiation has become the object of adoration.And in that transformation, the novel dims and blurs its cast of characters and becomes more and more an exploration of ideas, spirituality and politics, with a defence of Judaism and a daring proposal of Zionism. In all this Daniel emerges as an ethereal saviour but poor Gwen succumbs and loses her leading edge.And that is what made me wonder about how GE wrote her books and planned her work in her mind. Did she spend half of her day doing intellectual research on the subjects that captivated her and did she then transcribe her reading into her novel in the afternoons? What was her true objective, to expand her erudition, or to mould it into something else?I will have to put aside my curiosity for a while and continue reading her work, but with her intelligent writing and formidable abilities she certainly makes me ponder about the process of writing, that elusive act - creativity. How is it born and how does it live?And how did Rothko paint the above diptych?"], ["I finished this book about a month ago and have been letting my thoughts first simmer and then actually almost get pushed onto the back burner as our summer holidays began. Once I decided to look over my notes, I realized that a review might be quite overwhelming. Furthermore, the book did not necessarily endear itself to me more over time as many typically do when I prepare to write down my impressions. On the other hand, I most certainly acknowledge that this was an important book and quite a feat of writing on the part of George Eliot. I applaud her efforts at setting on paper her ideas regarding feminism, the British aristocracy, and racial identity, in particular that of Judaism. What I had the most trouble with was the often cumbersome reflections of the main characters which detracted from the flow of the narrative. The interactions between the characters were to me the most stimulating portions to absorb as a reader. The characterizations were well done \u2013 some characters being more interesting, even if not likable, than others. \"She had a na\u00efve delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends\u2019 flattery as well as in the looking-glass.\" The spoiled and self-absorbed Gwendolen Harleth finds herself in a position she never expected to be \u2013 that of bad luck and sudden poverty. What is a girl to do in this situation? Degrade oneself by taking a position or, perhaps worse yet, accept an offer of marriage? \"Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in humdrum.\" Saucy little turns of phrase such as this won me over and held my attention. Gwendolen was perhaps the most interesting and multi-layered character of this book.When Gwendolen Harleth meets the saintlike figure of Daniel Deronda, their lives become connected as she attempts to better herself to become deserving of his friendship and esteem. But while Gwendolen fights her demons, Deronda struggles with his own identity crisis - one which stems from an unknown parentage as well as from a strong spiritual link to an impassioned Jewish nationalist, Mordecai. Deronda \"had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties.\" Throughout this novel, Eliot illustrates the feelings of anti-Semitism which were prevalent during the 19th century. Through Deronda, however, these feelings are changed as he develops a relationship with both Mirah, to whom he is also a savior, as well as Mordecai. Deronda learns the true and principled nature of the Jewish people and their desire to achieve a national identity. \"\u2026 let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West\u2026\"Several more players are introduced into the plot, too many for me to delve into detail here. I will say that Mr. Grandcourt and Mr. Lush make my list for the most strikingly malodorous individuals \u2013 in a very amusing sort of way. They provided a nice counterbalance to the gushing wholesomeness of Deronda and Mirah. Gwendolen\u2019s mother was a bit silly and spineless, especially in relation to her daughter. This was my fourth George Eliot novel. While I did like it - once I plowed through the more laborious portions of it- I have to say that it is my least favorite so far. Both Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss were much more readable and engaging and I would recommend either of these \u2013 especially for a first time Eliot reader. I am glad that I read this one, and happy to add it to my list of more difficult tomes I have completed. 3.5 stars rounded down."], ["(Re-read from June 07 to June 12, 2012)I had forgotten what a hard work reading Daniel Deronda was. It has to be Eliot\u2019s most challenging and overwhelming novel, yet such a great pleasure to read and re-read! It's enormously ambitious novel, broad in its scope, space, time and history. The setting itself is untypical of Eliot\u2019s previous novels. It\u2019s no longer the idyllic, provincial villages of Adam Bede or Middlemarch, but Daniel Deronda is set at the heart of cosmopolitan aristocracy of contemporary London. The politics are no longer local, but global as Eliot scrutinises the exploits of British Empire. The stakes are much higher; the individual identities are threatened and lost. The conflict is personal, yet also very social. Of all the Eliot\u2019s novels, Daniel Deronda is the most related to our contemporary society as Eliot explores the themes of racial identity, prejudice, importance of tolerance, religion, the question of gender boundaries, imperialism and Zionism. Gwendolen Harleth has to be Eliot's most remarkable and fascinating creation. In fact, I am in love with Gwendolen. The main reason I re-read this novel because I missed her. I missed being in her mind, to follow her cognitions, her mental anguish, her witty repartees, sheer snobbery, ambition and heedless narcissism. She is of course not the first vain or shallow female character ever created by Eliot. The \u2018vain girl\u2019 features in most of Eliot\u2019s novels, often as a contrast to the heroine. She is there as Hetty in Adam Bede, Esther in Felix Holt, Rosamond in Middlemarch. But in Daniel Deronda, Gwendolen is put at the centre of the stage and her narcissism is taken to extremes, that there is a scene where she is moved to kiss her own reflection in the mirror. Like countless other women, she suffers from the restrictions Victorian society imposed on any respectable woman. She is a dreamer and sees marriage not as a loving union, but as a way to achieve status and power. She marries Grandcourt because she thinks she will be able to manage him and make him her \u201cslave\u201d. Yet contrary to her expectations, the marriage turns out to be an abusive one. Gwendolen fails to realise that Grandcourt also has an iron will of his own. The irony is that her decision to marry the incredibly wealthy Grandcourt was to some extent influenced by her selfless concern towards her bankrupt family. So, her partly selfless act becomes the bane of her life. Grandcourt is bent on to be \u201ca master of a woman who would have liked to master him\u201d. A painful psychological struggle for power ensues between them and Gwendolen is quickly crushed by him. His secret becomes her guilt, a yoke around her neck which continually gnaws at her conscience. He breaks her spirit and she becomes withered from inside, \u201ca diseased soul\u201d, but is forced to play a charade of a happy wife.I liked Deronda even if I found him to be rigid and morally superior. He is Eliot\u2019s most feminine hero. His ostensibly \u2018feminine\u2019 quality of abundant empathy and psychological perceptiveness is contrasted with Gwendolen\u2019s \u2018masculine\u2019 desire for power. He is the only person who sees Gwendolen for what she is behind her mask of superficial pride and cheerfulness. Naturally, Gwendolen is drawn to Deronda to help her make her life more bearable. He becomes her redeemer, in the same way as he redeems her necklace which she pawns after gambling. Her letter to him contains the most moving and tear-inducing lines of the whole novel. But, Deronda is the man with his own set of troubles. Unsure of his true identity, he struggles to find a stable niche in society. He is the medium which Eliot uses to explore the plight of London's scorned Jewish community and the emergence of Zionism, for which this novel is perhaps most famous for.Daniel Deronda is highly symbolic novel. All those literary references to mythology, science, philosophy, religion and mysticism, which slightly irritated me at first reading, fit perfectly in the thematic framework of the novel. The characters themselves are symbols. Grandcourt symbolises the corruption and vulgarity of English aristocracy, given to reckless materialism and hedonism. His need to crush Gwendolen could be interpreted as the Empire\u2019s colonial ambitions to conquer and enslave the population of the Third World. Deronda\u2019s alienation is symbolically shared by the Jewish people to a broader extent, who are scattered around the world with no actual homeland and scorned by the native population of their home countries.Overall, Daniel Deronda is a terribly exhausting but an equally rewarding read. If you are new to Eliot, I wouldn't recommend reading this first as it might put you off Eliot forever, but her earlier works such as The Mill on the Floss."], ["While ostensibly the story of one Daniel Deronda, a young man of (we learn) unknown parentage, raised to be an educated Englishman of worth and standing, this novel is also the tale of Gwendolen Harleth, and how their lives intersect. We are introduced to both early on and see them off and on over time as they face changes within their families, their sense of self, their future. This is my third Eliot novel. While I found some truly wonderful prose here, as I have found in the others I have read, I was left with the impression that Eliot attempted more than she could comfortably accomplish. Her character descriptions are typically excellent, some quite amusing. She is able to skewer her people both lovingly --- and not. As an example of the first (perhaps) there is this description of Gwendolen.And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the back of the  chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense because one's own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had  a naive delight in her fortunate self... (loc 972)As for another character, Grandcourt:when he raised his hat he showed an extensive  baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish- blond hair...; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with  only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular. It was not  possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated....his long narrow grey eyes expressed nothing but indifference. (loc 2507)But after these characterizations comes the plot and here comes also what, for me, was the problem. Here it felt as if Eliot's concern for the politics and history of her story overwhelmed the narrative. That never really gelled with the basic story of the characters. The polemics overshadowed several chapters and a few of the characters, seeming to reduce them to ciphers. But Eliot is still a powerful writer and, often, a clever and beautiful writer. I didn't find her writing about the \"cause\" too strident. Some of it I found very appealing. But as a whole I don't think it succeeded in bringing the story of Daniel Deronda fully to life."], ["This last novel by George Eliot is a psychological investigation into the question of identity and role. Identity concealed, identity as a role to be performed, identity as a prison. This is also the only written in Eliot's own time, instead of some decades previous. It asks difficult questions about the nature of class, race, and gender, and their understanding in contemporary society.Upon this, there is a dimension of secularism and religious mysticism. The figure of Mordecai, infusing political ideas with religious symbolism - and the background presence of references to death and the supernatural - all this is an unusual step for Eliot, who is otherwise committed to psychological realism. Another key focus of the novel is positive portrayal of Judaism - then an oppressed and stereotyped religious minority in England, even after Disraeli became Prime Minister. Mirah seems a childish naif, almost a noble savage, and seeing Daniel's relationship with her is discomfiting. Even in her strenuous attempts to show that this oppressed and ignored group are in fact human beings with consciences, hopes, and dreams, Eliot perhaps unconsciously wanders into some stereotyping. That is a more persistent form of racism, one which refers to stereotyping instead of active hatred and spite.Even so, Eliot takes great pains to sympathize and learn here. She grants a voice to this people's hope for a new land, a home, a place to find others like you, and a place to call one's own. All of this is tied with the words Zionism and the land of Israel, which are loaded with new implications and urgency over the next century and a half. The historical introduction assures us that the Jewish community were elated by this sympathetic representation. For any flaws it may have after over a century, Eliot has gone out of her way to lend her considerable gifts in writing and psychological depiction to empathize with them - a noted step up from anything before."], ["This was one of those long stories that in the end were worth a read. I have previously read \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d by George Eliot, but in many ways I find \u201cDaniel Deronda\u201d to be a different story that is interesting in many ways. Our main character, Gwendolen, is quite a character. She\u2019s selfish, attention-seeking and frivolous, and in many ways she actually reminded me of Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. I liked reading about her a lot - especially because she does change throughout the narrative - but some people might find her too repulsive to take an interest in. The other main character is Daniel Deronda who is, in many ways, the opposite of Gwendolen. It\u2019s very interesting to see the way his life is parallelled to Gwendolen\u2019s; especially because his life is in many ways different from hers. He\u2019s considerate, caring, and he develops a fondness for Jews and wants to explore their religion and way of living in spite of them being anhorred by most white Christians in the current English society. This is an epic tale that takes devotion to get through, but while it took me some effort to read it because of its many reflections on life (oftentimes directed directly to the reader which I wasn\u2019t that fond of), all in all I find this work to be accomplished, entertaining and very interesting! It\u2019s definitely worth a read, and I\u2019m happy that I got to be acquainted with Gwendolen, Daniel and the magnificent set of characters."], ["Now here\u2019s a book that combines two of my very favorite things: classic British romance with \u2013 YES! \u2013 Jewish themes. Marian Evans a/k/a George Eliot even went to Frankfurt am Main to do research for the book \u2013 in the times of no less than Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch! I think I\u2019ve found a thesis topic if I ever get to graduate school. Till then, though, I\u2019ll have to content myself with this review. No major spoilers, but it is a pretty detailed plot summary, so if you want to be 100% safe, skip to the last two paragraphs.In the opening scene, we meet Gwendolen Harleth (as in, sounds like \u201charlot\u201d) who is on a winning streak at a roulette table. Observing her is the title character, Daniel Deronda. She feels he is judging her negatively, which disconcerts her, so she begins to lose. Within the next few scenes, he takes a mysterious action which really unnerves her. And that is the last we see of him until Chapter 16.The story then backtracks to Gwendolen\u2019s family life, and this is the part that is most reminiscent of a Jane Austen novel (though Eliot\u2019s prose is much denser). Gwendolen\u2019s social position is similar to that of the Dashwood girls; she\u2019s not rich, but she socializes in the upper class circle of a small country-town. As a character, though, she is more of an anti-heroine than heroine. Like Lydia Bennet, she\u2019s out first and foremost for a good time, except she\u2019s cleverer and more calculating. She wants admirers, especially male admirers, but then scorns them without caring about how many hearts she breaks. This section of the book is called \u201cThe Spoiled Child,\u201d and George Eliot paints the hateful portrait in painstaking detail.Enter Mr. Grandcourt. (Read grand + court = landed gentry.) He\u2019s way too suave for Gwendolen to scorn, and her family watches their courtship with eagerness. After all, from a financial standpoint, he\u2019s a Good Catch. But even when Gwendolen gets evidence of his rakishness, she finds she can\u2019t resist him. They marry. Then the novel shifts back to Daniel Deronda, a young gentleman with no clear direction. He was a serious scholar at Cambridge and proved himself to be exceptionally kind to his friends, but he lives in the shadow of not knowing who his parents are. Rumor has it that he is the illegitimate son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, the nobleman who raised him. Daniel also believes the rumors, but loves Sir Hugo too much to confront him about it. Meanwhile, Sir Hugo\u2019s legal heir is none other than Gwendolen\u2019s husband, Mr. Grandcourt.In a scene I won\u2019t dare spoil, Daniel encounters Mirah, a Jewess. She is literally a \u201ctinok she nishbu,\u201d a kidnapped child raised away from Judaism. When Daniel finds her, she is nineteen years old, has escaped her captors, and is in desperate search of her family. Daniel, like Harry Potter, has \u201ca thing about saving people,\u201d so he joins in the search, and this leads him into the Jewish communities of London and Frankfurt.Jews, especially baalei teshuva, will appreciate if not love Chapter 32. It includes the descriptions of the Frankfurt synagogue \u2013 taken from Rav Hirsch; I just can\u2019t get over it! \u2013 and Mirah\u2019s passionate declaration to her Christian friends, \u201cI will always cling to my people.\u201d Mirah is a bit of a Mary Sue, but she gives voice to the pintele Yid that motivates all us BTs. How in the world did George Eliot know?The rest of the novel alternates between scenes of Gwendolen in her souring marriage and scenes with the Jewish characters, which notably includes a visionary named Mordecai who is preaching religious Zionism. Daniel, the \"knight errant,\" weaves his way through all of their lives. (Comic relief from Daniel's friend, Hans Meyrick.) Naturally, I am partial to the Jewish sections, but from a literary point of view, the portrayal of Gwendolen is the most masterful part of the novel. No character goes through as dramatic a transformation as she.I must reiterate that George Eliot does not reach Jane Austen in terms of prose style. At times the text is so heavy and full of extraneous detail that I suspected that like Dickens, she was paid by the word. But while Dickens was making it big with Fagin, Eliot was taking on anti-Semitism, not just by creating positive Jewish characters, but by letting her Christian characters work through their prejudices in the course of the novel. That makes her a heroine in my eyes.The scholarly introduction to my copy of the novel included some very interesting literary history. The British critics of the time panned the book for its Jewish themes. One suggested that Eliot should have left the Jews out and just called the book Gwendolen. An anonymous sequel by that title appeared a few years later, doing more or less that by killing off the Jewish characters and continuing the story of Gwendolen and Deronda. But the Jewish community\u2019s reaction was a mirror image of the British critics'. The Jews loved the book, though some said that the romantic themes detracted from the main point of the novel, which was Zionism. And in parallel to the anonymous sequel, the German Jewish novelist Marcus Lehman adapted the book to include only the Jewish themes. I think the whole thing is pretty funny.Personally, I loved both parts of the book \u2013 the British and the Jewish. If you\u2019re a fan of either genre, this is a worthwhile read. And if, like me, you\u2019re a fan of both, chances are that you\u2019ll find in this book a lifetime favorite you\u2019ll be happy to immerse yourself in over and over again."], ["This ambitious novel melds the stories of two very different characters, so perhaps it's appropriate that the novel itself seems a hybrid of a little bit of a lot of what we expect from 19th-century British novelists: the sensational melodrama of Wilkie Collins; the perfection of 'good' characters a la Dickens, along with his humor and irony (though Eliot's is more subtle); the satire of marriage customs and the problem of moneymaking for females who are trained to be helpless, reminiscent of the arguably-18th-century Austen; and the morality, compassion and authorial asides of Eliot herself. As only one example of the latter, Eliot literally excuses the faults of most of the characters (excepting the one true villain of the work) in sentences as superfluous as Gwendolen's younger half-sisters. I was intrigued by Chapter 11 whereby we 'hear' the thoughts between the spoken words of Gwen and Grandcourt upon their first meeting. Since it's early on, I hoped for more such innovation in its prose. But it is ideas, more than any other element, that are much more in the forefront, especially in the case of its eponymous character, who is obviously a Jesus-figure. He's not the only one who is almost too perfect and it's a bit of a relief for the 21st-century reader when one of these characters suffers understandable jealousy, seemingly her only 'fault'.Literary (as well as artistic and political) allusions abound and I enjoyed those that I caught -- classical mythology and The Divine Comedy stand out for me. Reading this novel is to know Eliot's brilliance and her genius."], ["3.5 stars-rounded up to 4George Eliot\u2019s tome, Daniel Deronda, was her last novel and it is anything but an easy read. Quite frequently when the narrative began to move and become quite interesting, Eliot would veer off into another direction and leave me champing at the bit to get back to the story. Having recently read Middlemarch, I couldn\u2019t help feeling that these characters were all pale and colorless next to those I had just left behind. The character, Daniel Deronda, was a particular puzzle to me, with reactions that did not seem to be realistic and too much of an effort to make her a type instead of an individual. Perhaps I was just too worn out with his \u201cgoodness\u201d to really like him. Gwendolen was understandable and flawed enough to make up for it. She was both interesting and represented the most growth and change through the course of the novel.I started this novel with a pretty serious dislike of Gwendolen, the spoiled girl, but by the end of the novel my attitude toward her had softened. I saw her as a bit of a Hardy character, caught in the awareness of her faults, without any avenue for correcting them or atoning for her sins. Without giving anything of the plot away, I cannot help admiring her resistance of giving in to the basest reaction to her situation. At the last, I think she was much harder on herself than I would have been inclined to be. Obviously, much of the purpose of this novel is to address the place of Jewish customs and society in 19th Century Europe. Eliot appears to have some very strong feelings about the maintenance of the Jewish people as a separate identity vs. the efforts to absorb them into the Christian society, with the loss of their own specific religion, customs and heritage. I could not help reading this novel with an eye toward what came later, the holocaust and the rise of the Jewish State. I was very interested in what I saw as the struggle to understand Jews and admit them to be on equal standing with their peers. I wonder what kind of reception this got at the time it was written. Although I recognized Eliot\u2019s purpose being to explain and perhaps endear us to the Jewish characters, they were the characters I could least understand. Mordecai\u2019s almost paranormal recognition of Daniel as a like soul, Mirah\u2019s perfection (along with Daniel\u2019s), and the coldness of Daniel\u2019s mother make them seem less accessible. And, she cannot resist bringing in some of the oldest and most cliched stereotypes when dealing with the Cohens...the typical Jewish family.I did find this passage from Daniel\u2019s mother very interesting:\u201dHad I not a rightful claim to be something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be an artist, though my father\u2019s will was against it. My nature gave me a charter.\u201dWe are confronted with the idea that a career and motherhood cannot exist side-by-side. She is the bold woman who chooses the career. She hasn\u2019t a speck of motherly feeling. She is painted throughout the entire episode as cold and unnatural. Superwoman had not yet been invented.While I did find this a worthy read, it cannot live up to the precedents set by Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss to my mind. I had scheduled it to read in 2015 and had to push it over to 2016, so it feels like a personal accomplishment to have it behind me. I will be thinking about it for some time, I am sure and it may be one of those novels that grows in importance as it settles on my mind."]], "review_count": "0", "description": null, "author": "Henry  Martin"}, "Job: A Comedy of Justice": {"average_rating": "3.77", "review": [["I tried, I really did.

That said, it is quite an interesting story, with a double share of twists and turns, and throughout it all you're rather unsure exactly where Heinlein is going.The more religious minded might be rather offended at Heinlein's theological inversion of good and bad. I think this would be a tragedy, because the wide range of religions interwoven here it seems quite obvious this is not his version of the way things might be, but just a very creative exploration of \"what if...?\" What if you were just an unlucky pawn in a game between two really powerful players? What if they turned out to not be the most powerful? What if they were themselves not to high on the cosmic food chain? Where would that put you?Heinlein has never been lacking the creativity department, and in places I think he pretty much let it run wild in this book. All said, the theology is blatantly non-scriptural, and in places, anti-christian. It is quite an interesting read, just don't pick it up with the wrong expectations of what you're getting into."], ["I really tried to like this book, but I just didn't get it. The characters were flat and the scenarios they found themselves in seemed so episodic and inconsequential that, by about halfway through the book, I grew bored and apathetic.

Dig deeper, and you will discover that Cabell was Heinlein's favorite author, and that all of Heinlein's later works, from \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" onward, were attempts to mimic Cabell\"s 18-volume \"Biography of the Life of Manuel,\" of which \"Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice\" was not the best, merely the best-known.So how did Heinlein do? Well, Cabell repeatedly insisted that he wrote only for his own pleasure. Heinlein, in these later books, seemed to be indulging in a similar private obsession. If that is the case, he wouldn't have cared much what we think.That being said, \"Jurgen\" is a far, far better book than \"Job: A Comedy of Justice.\" Cabellian irony fit his mythic cosmos-building and droll story constructs. Heinlein may have aimed for irony, but his personal philosophy rubbed against the grain of that emprise. He was, in the end, a pretty straight-forward guy, if a nudist and all-around crank. This book is one of those very odd failures that may haunt unwary readers for reasons hard to grasp. The haunting, I think, is due entirely to the strange and unlikely presence of the shade of James Branch Cabell."], ["To start, it is the year 1994, and in Alexander Hergensheimer's world, there are no airplanes, television, computers or traffic lights. Their only form of aeronautic transportation comes in the form of dirigibles. The world is incredibly moralistic, with abortion now termed a capital offense. A \"federal law making the manufacture, sale, possession, importation, transportation, and/or use of any contraceptive drug or device a felony carrying a mandatory prison sentence of not less than a year and a day\". Swearing is a crime liable with punishment in the stocks in the form of public nudity and ends with wrongdoer voluntarily leaving the community. Dresses cover all the skin and Women Do Not Have The Vote.However, on a cruise ship trip, he finds it all gone awry as one unfortuznate tourist tour to the Polynesian islands finds him walking through fire...and into another universe. He is no longer Alexander Hergensheimer. He is now Alec L. Graham, a man with questionable associates, who has an affair with his stewardess, Margrethre, and one million dollars in his safety deposit box on the ship. Amazingly enough, he learns to cope pretty well with everything. That is, until, for some ridiculous reason, the ship hits an iceberg, in the middle of the Southern seas at that, and he ends up in another universe...again, but this time, with Margrethe at his side.And from there, Alex and Margrethe experience one world change after another, until they grow faster and faster in frequency. In the midst of all this, Alex is convinced the End of Days has come, and that God is showing the beginning signs of His Apocalypse. As Alex struggles to try to save Margrethe from her heathen ways, their time runs out, and the problem is taken out of his hands. In Heaven, Alex finds that it's not all it's cracked up to be. And that, horribly, Margrethe is nowhere to be found. From Heaven to Hell, he struggles to find her. And as he begins to realize that maybe all is lost, Satan comes to his rescue, with insights that his mind yearns to disbelieve. As they go to a Higher Power, higher even than God, Alex struggle to make sense of it all, and to put into context what is really important to him, his faith...or Margrethe.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The title of this book is apt, and ironic. It parallels the tale of Job in the Bible, wherein he suffers many trials, before finally finding happiness. I always found it, extremely offensive in the end, that it was nothing but a game between God and Satan. God trying to prove the loyalty of Job, and Satan saying otherwise. In short, Job was a tale of how God plays with our lives. And in this book, God plays with Everything. He plays with a man's reality, his beliefs, and even his faith. And Satan becomes the sympathetic one, a trickster who possesses something God does not have, the ability to understand human emotion. Because at some point, the trickster knows when to stop, but the deity does not. This book encourages questions. Such as, how can people worship a God who is so far apart from the human experience, that he does not understand their pain, pleasure, or love? God is the Alien. And Satan, though he may be evil, but through his countless centuries of human interaction, has in some small part of him, the knowing of a Human.It was amusing to read through all the different versions of Earth, and see how many ways people span the spectrum from extreme fanaticism, to extreme liberalism, and how machines range from antique technology, to the advanced. It was also interesting to see how a man, Alex, from a very religious background, would react to such changes. Would he waver in his faith, or be true to it? And would Margrethe, the woman in this tale, be able to cope with the changes brought on by her relationship with this man? They are both very different people. Alex was at times, a bigot, a chauvinist, and no doubt if he had had the opportunity, he would have denounced homosexuals and feminists as well. However, even he could not escape the changes these constant peeks into a different dimension, have wrought on his character. The title of this book is truly apt, as it really is a fun ride through the different versions of Earth, and eventually, Heaven and Hell. In the midst of it all, Alex is a believable character truly epitomizing the behavior of his original worlds. Alex, with his supremely moralistic upbringing, sometimes borders on bigotry and chauvinism in his thinking. The only fact which saves him from being a revolting character, is his minds ability to adapt and keep his mouth closed. I guess what saves him from behaving abominably, was that no parts were written were he was ablt to meet homosexuals and feminists. If he did, I'd be interested to see what behavior he'd show. Both he and Margrethe were blessed with hardworking and pleasing characters which enabled them to survive in the many different worlds they dwelt in for a time. Alex would preach, but it was inoffensive. His, somewhat bumbling behavior endeared him to people. Margrethe was beautiful, as well as a good soul. As Lazarus Long would say, \"she was innocent in her lechery.\" The most delightful surprise in this book, was the Rapture. I admit, I was expecting something more along the lines of wormhole opening in space. I guess, I really should have clued in on all the hints dropped (especially the title). I was irritated at first, the way a little kid expects a basketball for X-mas, but he gets a football instead. Well, I guess I'll just have to admit to myself that I can't always predict the twists in a story. Sometimes, we just get things wrong.In the aftermath of the Rapture, I was treated to a picture of Heaven and Hell, that I never expected to see. Heaven, is as place of strict rules, and a permanent hierarchy. It's revolt to any liberal thinker and burgeoning activist, because I'm sure, in this type of place, you can't instigate a revolt and change the status-quo. I, myself, believe that democracy is a myth, however, I do enjoy the illusion of it. However, the Heaven being shown, strips you of all your illusions. The rule in Heaven is RHIP, \"Rank Hath It's Privileges.\" There is no Golden Rule. Instead, there's a three-level ranking system. Angels on top, Saints in the middle, and Humans at the bottom. Again, I doubt God would stand for a reenactment of the French Revolution in his stratospheric territory.Hell, is as bureaucratic as any Earthian government. You increase or decrease in rank according to your wits, cunning, and manipulative talent. People compete for their place. Of course, you've got those who suffer, and those who enjoy. It's no different from Earth, except you in this place, you can actually see the demons when they talk to you. This book reminds me a lot of Heinlein's Time Enough for Love, in the way that he incorporates several settings and plots into one story. I also like the irreverence he has for religion, although my own Catholic upbringing hardwired into my head, has made me uneasy at some parts in the story. It's social conditioning though, so I can't quite help it. In the end, again, the story of Job is paralleled. After the many trials and tribulations, Alex and Margrethe are given new beginnings, not to mention new memories. The lives they lost as they journeyed, were replace with new ones. Just as Job's daughters and sons were replaced with new children. However, of these two parallel stories, I prefer Heinlein's. Alex came out of the experience, dispelling his naivety and blind faith, and was reborn, a more discerning and open-minded man. Job, on the other hand, came out of his experience, minus twelve children. (It doesn't matter to me that they were replaced. They're not goldfish you can flush down the toilet, then go to the pet store to buy new ones.)"], ["This book is like distilled Heinlein.

We don't know who we are, or where we came from, or why we are here. My dilemma was merely fresher, not different. \"One thing (possibly the only thing) I learned in seminary was to face calmly the ancient mystery of life, untroubled by my inability to solve it.

I also had a hard time understanding what caused him to fall in love with Marga, and even more, WTF did Marga see in him?It's an interesting meditation on religious fundamentalism, but ultimately it strikes me as a little too facile. It was written near the end of Heinlein's career and it feels a little as if it were done by rote. There are several recycled bits from earlier works, including the obligatory reference to consensual parent/child sex. The dialogue is a bit stiff- RAH was very stingy with his contractions, and I think that makes for awkward sounding conversations.The Farnsworth family were far and away my favorite characters. I liked the steampunky elements of the first several chapters. In the end, though, I couldn't get past my distaste for Alex.

Katie Miler is traumatized after her boyfriend is killed in a van in which she was also a passenger. How will she find her way out of the valley of her depression?

What will bring this girl out of the shadows of fear, and open her heart to life\u2014and love?My Review: This is the second book in the Indiana Cousins series. The book can be read as a stand alone. Like the previous book before it, it focuses on one character in each book so you can see how each character grows and changes over time.Katie is still not over the tragic death of her boyfriend Timothy who was killed in a car accident. Ever since Katie has these attacks where she has a feeling of unreality and a sense of panic and like she is going to die. Her good friend Freeman is the one who tells her it is panic attacks and helps her get over them.Over time her and Freeman draw closer and a romance starts to brew. There is one hitch, there is a woman who wants Freeman for herself. I felt that the love story in this books was authentic and relatable. You could see where each character was coming from and it was easily to become emotionally invested in the outcome. You find yourself rooting for Katie all the way.Like the previous book this book provided insight into the Amish lifestyle which I enjoyed. It even has some Amish vocabulary words and refers to the things that the Amish would. It also does not gloss over difficulties such as a woman spreading gossip about Katie which we can all relate to.This is a book that I would recommend to anyone wanting to get a glimpse into the Amish way of life and for those looking for a sweet inspirational and or romance.This review was originally posted on Adventures in Never Never Land"], ["While reading the novel Treasure Island, the author displayed different themes through each events. These themes were heroic, adventure, wealth, and growing up. For example, when Jim Hawkins(the main character) goes on a voyage to a daring Treasure Island, he begins his adventure of discovering treasure and the difference of his own shipmates. Deidre Laiken is trying to tell readers to enjoy and have an adventure while reading this book because you can relate to the certain things that Jim goes through and become interested in setting your own experience of life. This demonstrates that the author wants readers to keep wondering what's going to come next because in every adventure you always have to expect the unexpected. The various events that occur in the novel shows how the author relates it to the real world. For instance, this whole novel takes place in the eighteenth century, when pirates were known. This reveals the books time setting is an actual part of history that can be true and how it happened centuries ago. While reading this book there were no outrages events or scenes that made me feel very uncomfortable but there were certain scenes that were involved with some killings that were meant to be. All of the certain events that happened made me think that in life, certain things happen for a reason and you or anyone else cant stop it from happening. Overall, this book has events that lead up one after the other, making you want to keep reading to find out what happens next .This novel also allows readers to set of onto an adventure with Jim and his shipmates to discover the secrets and treasures of Treasure Island. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone because it has an adventure to it and makes readers interested , that they would not stop reading it.

This book really is an alphabetic backward experience.I recommend for any child who has their alphabet down without looking at them and who is starting to read on their own. I know that may not seem fair, but truthfully I wouldn't be reading this title to my kids without them being able to tell me the alphabet without having to look at something with them on it and could tell me which letter I'm holding up on a gumbled deck of flashcards.

All vowels in this gorgeously and simply illustrated yet very appealing book are short, keeping it simple and consistent. The sentence structure at the top of the page features large text, encircled by speech bubbles to separate it from the rest of the appropriate ending letter creatures on the page, who are engaged in a corresponding letter\u2019s action. This book will engage children from 0 to 10."], ["Mark Shulman and Tamara Petrosino return with a fabulous follow-up to last season's \"AA is for Aardvark.\" And it's got a clever new twist. The alphabetic antics continue--starting from the end! That's why \"A\" is for \"zebrA \"and \"Z\" is for \"jazZ,\" and nothing's what you'd expect. The featured letter doesn't appear just once--it's sprinkled throughout the hilarious illustrations. The \"I\" page not only has \"sushI,\" there's \"delI,\" \"spaghettI,\" \"graffitI,\" and \"khakI,\" too. And if you thinkworking backwards makes it easier, well, just try to come up with words that end in Q or J! The results can be quite surprising!Teachers, librarians, parents, and kids will love the silly--but smart--acrobatics involved in unearthing all these words, along with the witty way the book reinforces the sounds of letters and teaches kids how much fun playing with language can be.Might be a little to difficult for story time"], ["From my career as a reading tutor a love for alphabet picture books has followed. The problem is that once my students learn their ABC's these books are no longer needed. This is why I love this book. I can bring this book for all stages of learning. Children can pick out the letters in the words. This is a good test of whether or not they understand the letters or if they assume it will be the first letter of a word. This book also helps with understanding letter changes of plural forms. For instance \"F is for wolf, but not for two.\" This is a fun and surprising book with plenty of twists to keep my students interacting."], ["A very clever alphabet book that uses the LAST letter in a word as the clue to the word...A is for zebrA, P is for hiP-hoP, U is for gnU.

Looking back with my jaded, myopic grown-up eye, I can see that the new letters beyond Z are simple amalgamations of ordinary Roman letters, but at the time I was transfixed (and highly amused) by the bizarre shapes custom-made to name exotic animals.

The story is about a boy who learns about the alphabets and he uses the names of the animal to associate with the letters. Once he reaches to Z for Zebra, he is excited that now he knows his ABC's.Unfortunately another kid comes and rains on his parade and tells him that there are more letters after Z and if I were that innocent kid I would beat him up. Dr. Seuss promotes this as new letters of the alphabet but it's just new words for imaginary creatures. You are a kid then you are oblivious to how Sh for example is not a new letter.The illustrations were okay not out of this world. I feel like I'm being a little bit cruel but when it comes to Dr. Seuss, there is so many books that are original and creative and this definitely does not live to my expectations.

People have recommended him on the basis of comparisons to  Douglas Adams, but Adams is, you know, funny. Here\u2019s what seems to pass for humor in a Tom Robbins novel: beets (the very existence of), a woman getting stung in a delicate place by a bee, and lesbians (the very existence of). And here\u2019s the kind of prose you can look forward to:The sky, layered with thin altostratus clouds and smog, appeared to reflect human suffering and failed to awaken in Claude visions of paradise. (Page 13)The sky was a velvety black paw pressing on the white landscape with a feline delicacy, stars flying like sparks from its fur. (Page 36)With the absence of the cloud cover that normally caused the sky over Seattle to resemble cottage cheese that had been dragged nine miles behind a cement truck, the city, for the first time in memory, would have an unobstructed view of one of nature\u2019s most mystical spectacles. (Page 47)When Claude glanced at the sky, he saw that the text of  Les Miserables had been painted over by Salvador Dali. The sun was so round and glossy and black that had it a figure eight on it, well, it would have validated a lot of long-standing philosophical and theological complaints, underlining once and for all just where we earthlings sit on the cosmic pool table. (Page 81)A few flat clouds folded themselves like crepes over fillings of apricot sky. Pompadours of supper-time smoke billowed from chimneys, separating into girlish pigtails as the breeze combed them out, above the slate rooftops. Chestnut blossoms, weary from having been admired all day, wore faint smiles of anticipation. (Page 201)And of course:Above Seattle, the many-buttocked sky continued to grind. (Page 312)And that\u2019s just me culling annoying descriptions of the sky. Imagine 350 dense, unrelenting pages of this crap. I never thought a book about immortality\u2014one of my favorite subjects\u2014could ever inspire in me such a desperate desire for it all to please just end."], ["Before I knew that magical realism was a thing, I loved Tom Robbins. Before I fell hard for postmodernism, I fell for Tom Robbins. Before I had developed a literary taste that I can be proud of, there was the beacon of hope for me that is Tom Robbins.There aren\u2019t many things I loved in high school that I still love now: Listening to the same Dashboard Confessional CD on infinite repeat, running to Livejournal to unselfconsciously document every oh-so-significant spike in my emotional temperature and wearing brightly colored tights under fishnet stockings are all things I\u2019ve let slip into the past but Robbins has seen me through all the milestones and minutia of my teenage and twentysomething years.Jitterbug Perfume was not my first foray into the weirdly wonderful and wonderfully weird worlds that Robbins builds from the gossamer threads of imagination unbound (I'm actually not sure which one popped my Robbins cherry but I do know I first read this one during my last summer of college when I was a live-in nanny -- which was a surprisingly good summer for bibliomania, actually). It is, along with Skinny Legs and All, tied for the honor of being my favorite of his, and both novels are longtime mainstays of my desert-island reading list. So when my craving for Robbins got to be too demanding to be delayed any longer and the heady of perfume of spring was calling too loudly for the only companion novel that successfully captured the power of scent in words, I knew I could rely on this book to deliver everything I needed and more.It is tempting (like, it is taking an inordinate amount of self-control to fight the impulse) to say something about how beets are the beating heart of this novel but that's only because I have a sick, unironic penchant for puns. Really, this is a story that spans 1,000 years (or about as long as I've been staring at the computer screen while waiting for this review to write itself C'MON BOOZE LUBRICATE MY THOUGHT PROCESS NOW) and connects Seattle to New Orleans to Paris to Bohemia of yore with the wafting of a fragrance. There's also a very loyal swarm of bees serving as the halo a modern-day Christ figure would wear and Pan comes and goes to prove that man creates and destroys gods with a fury and jealously no spiritual figurehead would ever dare to act on. And a fallen king who proves that love can last more than a lifetime and winds up behind bars in the process (if that's not a metaphor for modern times, I don't know what is). ...You know, I thought a little liquid creativity would help me here but it is just so damn hard to express how much and why I love this book and how excited I am that, almost eight years later, it is actually even better than I remembered. This is so much more than beautifully playful prose, a caution against taking oneself too seriously lest you forget to stop and smell the beet pollen, more inventively evocative metaphors than a whole hockey team could shake some really long sticks at -- just to mention a few of the things that established my seemingly eternal entrenchment in the Tom Robbins fan club so many years ago. That's not to say that I wasn't thoroughly tickled by those elements this time around but the more subtle aspects of the storytelling were what really got to me during this most recent reading.This book is a little disarming because it addresses so many issues, Big Ticket and otherwise -- life, death, love, immortality and the conflicted yearning for it, what happens on the other side of death, the individual vs. societal norms, the search for perfection, scientific pursuits, religion (and the lack thereof) -- in such a lighthearted, unexpectedly connected way that its moments of seriousness pack a brutal but enlightening punch. A character who triumphs over death for a good millennium is bound to lose more than he gains in his willful longevity, and his moments of introspective contemplation are a little hard to watch unfold, especially as some of the other characters are revealed to be carrying around the kind of sadnesses that compel them to keep moving; I can now appreciate that there is a definite Pynchonian element of contrasting goofiness of the highest order against some truly sobering sorrows to maximize the impact of each emotional extreme.I was a little worried that, like so many things I've outgrown, my love of Robbins's unique storytelling might now be a thing of the past tense. But he so intricately layers and pieces together so much in his books that there is plenty to notice for a first time (like how Jitterbug Perfume really does follow the format of a hero's journey, complete with help of and hindrances from mythical beings, a never-say-die determination to reach the finish line, the occasional occurrence of wine-dark liquids, and even a visit from a cyclops) and even more to rediscover anew."], ["post-read: Ohhhh, I really missed reading Robbins. What fun! This book was both more and less wonderful than I'd remembered. More because I'd forgotten just what a superb stylist Robbins is (see mid-read comments). His plots are intricate, his characters are rendered in wonderful detail, down to the distinctive vocal stylings. His ideas, though perhaps a smidge stale twenty-five years on, are still interesting and fun and clever and smart, intellectual, but not in a showy or pedantic way. Plus there's that anxiety you get when you're, oh, twenty or so pages from the end of a book, thinking There's no way he can pull it all together satisfactorily in so few pages! But he does! It's a tiny bit cheesy, maybe just a wee bit pat, but c'mon. He had an awful lot of balls in the air. Less for a few reasons. I'd kindly blocked out the fact that everyone in a Tom Robbins novel sooner or later launches into a discourse that sounds exactly like Tom Robbins, which can get pretty annoying. Also, I forgot how letchy he can be. There's a lot of sex in this book \u2013 in fact, it's one of the four pillars of immortality \u2013 which is fine; it's just that the descriptions of it are often a bit much. (\"Alma hiccupped the mushroom scent of his spurt,\" ex, not to mention lots of glistening, semen-encrusted thighs, and that sort of thing.) The other thing, which isn't really bad or good, exactly, is that I think Tom Robbins is kind of a victim of himself. He's too much Tom Robbins sometimes. Too hippie-clich\u00e9; too cerebral-in-an-understandable-but-trippy-way; too specific with his characters, to the point where they become caricatures that are hard to take seriously; even, sadly, too over-the-top with his metaphors (\"his knuckle began rapping at his eye patch like a mongoloid woodpecker drilling for worms in a poker chip\"? Are you kidding?); just too... too much. I guess taking a few years off between Robbinses allows one to forget these drawbacks just enough to come back to him fresh and be able to enjoy his shimmering originality again. mid-read: It's not that I'd forgotten, exactly, but no one does metaphors like Tom Robbins.

This book grabbed all my sense at the spin of the very first few words into the very first paragraphs:\nTHE BEET IS THE MOST INTENSE of vegetables. The radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity. Beets are deadly serious.Slavic peoples get their physical characteristics from potatoes, their smoldering inquietude from radishes, their seriousness from beets. The beet is the melancholy vegetable, the one most willing to suffer. You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip . . .\nThe epigraph introduced the themes of the story:The history of civilization is the story of man's emancipation from a lot that was harsh, brutish, and short. Every step of that upward climb to a sophisticated way of life has been paralleled by a corresponding advance in the art of perfumery. \u2014ERIC MAPLEANDThe distinctive human problem from time immemorial has been the need to spiritualize human life, to lift it onto a special immortal plane, beyond the cycles of life and death that characterize all other organisms. \u2014ERNEST BECKERAlobar would survive a thousand years and recount his adventures to the modern seekers of magical perfumes, botany and longetivity.\nAlobar, however, since, thanks to the Bandaloop, he had witnessed three hundred and eighty-five thousand, eight hundred and six sunrises in his life, and judging from the milky molluscan glow seeping through the barred window, was about to witness yet another.\nHowever, the moment he was devoid of the opportunity to exercise his own believes, the genes came calling:\nMore awake, actually, for the guards dozed over their detective magazines, dreamily musing about the long Thanksgiving weekend that was approaching, while Alobar was kept fully conscious by the smell of his body aging. Yes, he could smell it. During the first year of his sentence, he hadn't aged a notch. His body was still running on the impetus of a millennium of immortalist practices.With the exception of breathing techniques, he was unable to continue those practices in prison, however, and one day it dawned on his cellular bankers that the immunity accounts were overdrawn and there hadn't been a deposit in fifteen months. The DNA demanded an audit. It was learned that Alobar's figures were juggled. He had successfully embezzled more than nine hundred years.Outraged, the DNA must have petitioned for compensation, because within a week, Alobar's salt-and-pepper hair had turned into a pillar of sodium. Wrinkle troops hit the beaches under his eyes, dug trenches, and immediately radioed for reinforcements. Someone was mixing cement in his joints. Now, in his third year behind bars, he could smell, taste, and hear the accelerated aging going on inside him. It smelled like mothballs. It tasted like stale chip dip. It sounded like Lawrence Welk.\nThe prose was just so picturesque and descriptive that it was hard for me not to add even more quotes from the book\nTHE CARROT SYMBOLIZES financial success; a promised, often illusory reward. A carrot is a wish, a lie, a dream. In that sense, it has something in common with perfume. A beet, however . . . a beet is proletarian, immediate, and, in a thoroughly unglamorous way, morbid. What is the message a beet bears to a perfumer? That his chic, elitist ways are doomed? That he might profit from a more natural, earthy, straightforward approach? This beet, this ember, this miner's bloodshot eye, this apple that an owl has pierced, is it a warning or friendly advice?\nPostmodernism, magic realism, epic moments fill up this lengthy, too often dragging tale, bogged down by philosophical daydreaming and too much carnal moments for my taste, but the humor and the literary rhythms of the prose kept me reading.Alobar's tale spanned several continents and nine centuries. It is the story of perfume, of consciousness, of historical moments, of life and beet! This book was an ambitious undertaking that worked very well. It's not a book for everyone, but certainly leaves much to ponder in its wake. It was a slow read. But a very good one.One of my favorite quotes from the book:  Louisiana in September is like an obscene phone call from nature.I truly loved the experience. And now for more beet in the diet and the Bandaloop dances. I'm all set to meet up with Aljobar in my next life :-)Postscript in the book:ABOUT THE AUTHOR TOM ROBBINS has been called \u201ca vital natural resource\u201d by The Portland Oregonian, \u201cone of the wildest and most entertaining novelists in the world\u201d by the Financial Times of London, and \u201cthe most dangerous writer in the world today\u201d by Fernanda Pivano of Italy's Corriere della Sera. A Southerner by birth, Robbins has lived in and around Seattle since 1962.After reading this book, you will have to agree :-)) A friend recommended the book and curiosity got the better of me of course, but I'm glad I took it on."], ["Told to read this by my boyfriend who declared that I NEEDED to read this book to understand him, I am now disgusted and reconsidering my relationship. Ok, I'm kidding, but I take solace in the fact he read this book in high school.Oddly enough, my best friend also said this is her favorite book.Either I'm surprised to discover I'm a prude, or Robbins wastes way too much of a promising book on misogynistic fantasies of all women as nymphomaniacs who live and breathe to seduce and pleasure their usually significantly older male partners. The only relationship that didn't annoy me was between Priscilla and Ricki, and even that one was sexually focused. I don't mind reading about sex, in fact I rather enjoy it if done tastefully, but I feel that the overwhelming sexual descriptions took away from the substance of Robbins' ideas. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout most of it and was even embarassed when a man in a plane commented on my book choice, noting that another author he reads is \"like Tom Robbins if he had a heart.\" I give it two stars because Robbins is clever (maybe too clever) and funny and I feel that the ending made up for what was lacking earlier in the book. Or maybe I was just glad to be done with it."], ["The most glarin\u2019 failure o\u2019 the intelligentsia in modern times has been its inability to take comedy seriously. The above Wiggs Dannyboy quote sums up the experience of my first Tom Robbins novel. It was a wild, irreverent, intellectually challenging and most of all a \u2018fun\u2019 ride, a \u2018look up Chomolungma\u2019s skirts\u2019, a perennial search for \u2018the perfect taco\u2019, a quest for immortality and the meaning of life that tries to expose the connections between perfume, tantric sex, transcendental meditation, pagan rites and ballroom dancing ... oh! and beets. Of our nine planets, Saturn is the one that looks like fun. Of our trees, the palm is the obvious stand-up comedian. Among fowl, the jester\u2019s cap is worn by the duck. Of our fruits and vegetables, the tomato could play Falstaff, the banana a more slapstick role. As Hamlet \u2013 or Macbeth \u2013 the beet is cast. The beet, or mangel-wurzel, gets the royal treatment in the novel, put on an equal footing with ancient deities and with esoteric fragrances, granted deep philosophical significance and mysterious metahysical powers. Robbins lets his exuberance fly from the very first page in singing a paean to the under-appreciated vegetable. The introduction also serves as a weeding out device for starched-collar or thin-skinned readers who might be easily offended by the satirical attacks on widely accepted atitudes and religions. Speaking for myself, the intro had the opposite effect of drawing me instantly into the story. The beet is the murderer returned to the scene of the crime. The beet is what happens when the cherry finished with the carrot. The beet is the ancient ancestor of the autumn moon, bearded, buried, all but fossilized; the dark green sails of the grounded moon-boat stitched with veins of primordial plasma; the kite string that once connected the moon to the Earth now a muddy whisker drilling desperately for rubies. The story / plot itself turned out to be almost irrelevant compared to the flow of ideas and the gleeful deconstruction of \u2018serious\u2019 literature. Priscilla the genius waitress is working in a Mexican food restaurant in Seattle and in her spare time she experiments with the ultimate perfume. Her mentor, Madame Devalier, is also working on a new perfume in New Orleans, with the help of an alluring assistant named V\u2019lu and of a supplier named Bingo Pajama. Across the ocean, in the perfume capital of the world, Marcel \u2018Bunny\u2019 LeFever is experimenting himself with the olfactive revolution. Later in the book, the different strands meet again in Seattle at an institute researching longevity under a modern Flower Power guru named Wiggs Dannyboy and a German Nobel laureate named Wolfgang Morgenstern. If you think this was easy to follow, add an Argentinian accordionist, a secret Tibetan sect named the Bandaloop, a Saxon King named Alobar and an Indian low-caste woman named Kudra, mix in Albert Einstein and a scene borrowed from Dante\u2019s Inferno, extend the plot to cover several centuries, include an impromptu history of perfume from the ancient to the modern times and put the cherry on the cake with the foul-smelling god of anarchy, drunkenness and promiscuity \u2013 PAN. Then you might have an idea of the epic scope of Tom Robbins\u2019 novel. According to Priscilla, the genius waitress, an \u2018alobar\u2019 is a unit of measurement that describes the rate at which \u2018Old Spice\u2019 after-shave lotion is absorbed by the lace on crotchless underpants, although at other times she has defined it as the time it takes \u2018Chanel No. 5\u2019 to evaporate from the wing tips of a wild duck flying backward. Of this long list of characters, all of whom are relevant in the economy of the novel, the catalyst or core element is probably Alobar, whose timeline come first and who defines in the most simple words the eternal human dillema : sooner or later we all have to deal with the awareness of death. Alobar refuses to accept Death\u2019s supremacy and inevitablity, setting out to find the secret of immortality: I may be mad, but I prefer the shit of this world to whatever ambrosias the next might offer. and, Alobar, once king, once serf, now individual \u2013 have you heard of individuals? \u2013 free and hungry, at your service. My mission? Well, frankly, I am running away from death. Heading East from his native Bohemia, Alobar learns that freedom of choice equates also with danger and hunger, and meets in Greece with one of the old wise ones - The Great God Pan \u2013 who adds another piece or two to the puzzle of existentialism and free will: Come with me, Alobar, for while we must go forever in despair, let us also go forever in the enjoyment of the world. and, The gods have a great sense of humor, don\u2019t they? If you lack the iron and the fizz to take control of your own life, if you insist on leaving your fate to the gods, then the gods will repay your weakness by having a grin or two at your expense. Should you fail to pilot your own ship, don\u2019t be surprised at what inappropriate port you find yourself docked. Refreshed by the god\u2019s drink and by the lusty dryads hanging around Pan, Alobar continues to head East, reaching the roof of the world where at first he seeks refuge in a Buddhist monastery, only to discover that he very much prefers the material to the spiritual life. A young Indian woman helps him to make the decision, and from this point forward they will be a couple. Here they teach that much of existence amounts only to misery; that misery is caused by desire; therefore, if desire is eliminated, then misery will be eliminated. Now, that is true enough, as far as it goes. There is plenty of misery in the world, all right, but there is ample pleasure, as well. If a person forswears pleasure in order to avoid misery, what has he gained? A life with neither misery nor pleasure is an empty, neutral existence, and, indeed, it is the nothingness of the void that is the lamas\u2019 final objective. To actively seek nothingness is worse than defeat; why, Kudra, it is surrender; craven, chickenhearted, dishonorable surrender. By this point of the journey I have also became aware of a tendency towards preaching on the part of the author, but I enjoy so much his barbed style that he gets a free pass for more of the same: If desire causes suffering, it may be because we do not desire wisely, or that we are inexpert at obtaining what we desire. Instead of hiding our heads in a prayer cloth and building walls against temptation, why not get better at fulfilling desire? Salvation is for the feeble, that\u2019s what I think. I don\u2019t want salvation. I want life, all of life, the miserable as well as the superb. Yay!!! for Alobar and Kudra ! Reader, be prepared for some steamy scenes of enjoying life under the majestic Chomolungma. Robbins continues to fire up his aphorism gun: To eliminate the agitation and disappointment of desire we need but awaken to the fact that we have everything we want and need right now. ... making time for a sideswipe at those serious, gloomy, cynical high-brow authors, comparing them with Timolus, who  judging the music contest between Pan and Apollo, had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the Apollonian lyre, thereby establishing the tradition that critics must laud polish and restraint, attack what is quirky and disobedient, a tradition that endures to this day. I would propose Robbins is deadly serious in his comedy, coming down hard on the side of Pan and decrying the ways first Christianity, and later Pure Reason (Descartes and his disciples, according to Alobar) have taught us that life is pain and suffering. In this plea, Robbins sounds to me like a later day hippie, a more articulate but equally passionate supporter of a life among flowers and unrestriced love. The old god had endured severe setbacks in the past: the disdain of Apollo and his snooty followers, the rise of cities, the hostility of the philosophers \u2013 from Aristotle to Descartes \u2013 with their smug contentions that man was reasonable and nature defective, and, most damaging of all, the concentrated efforts of the Christian church to discredit his authority by identifying his as Satan. The arrogant attacks, the dirty tricks, the indifference had rendered him weak and invisible, and might have destroyed him altogether had not an unreasonable affection for him persisted in isolated places: hidden valleys and distant mountain huts; and in the hearts of heretics, lusty women, madmen, and poets. The same theme of the fight between Pan and Apollo is picked up later by Priscilla and Wiggs Dannyboy in Seattle, as they discuss Flower Power and French existentialism:-\t Seems to me that the so-called happy people are the ones who are trivial. Avoiding reality and never thinking about anything important.-\tReality is subjective, and there\u2019s an unenlightened tendency in this culture to regard something as \u2018important\u2019 only if \u2018tis sober and severe. Sure and still you\u2019re right about your Cheerful Dumb, only they\u2019re not so much happy as lobotomized. But your Gloomy Smart are just as ridiculous. When you\u2019re unhappy, you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself. And you get to take yourself oh so very seriously. Your truly happy people, which is to say, your people who truly like themselves, they don\u2019t think about themselves very much. Your unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up, because that means he has to stop dwellin\u2019 on himself and start paying attention to the universe. Unhappiness is the ultimate form of self-indulgence. Practising what they preach, Priscilla and Wiggs follow in the footsteps of Alobar and Kudra, learning to find happiness in self-expression and getting in touch with their animal side. (view spoiler)[ \u201cThey can have their loaf o\u2019 warm bread, their new-mown hay. Nothin\u2019 beats the smell of a lassie freshly laid.\u201d exclaims Dannyboy in post-coital bliss.  (hide spoiler)]Where does perfume come in, you might ask? Well, it\u2019s complicated! and while it might have something to do with disguising the bad smell of Pan, the disappearance of dinosaurs or reaching directly into our subconscious part of our brains, I believe it is better to let the Parisian specialist, Bunny LeFever, explain.  Perfume, fundamentally, is the sexual attractant of flowers, or, in the case of civet and musk, of animals. Squeezed from the reproductive glands of plants and creatures, perfume is the smell of creation, a sign dramatically delivered to our senses of the Earth\u2019s regenerative powers \u2013 a message of hope and a message of pleasure.  and, I have spoken to you this afternoon of poetry and of sexual magic. Not too many years ago, the names of our perfumes bore testimony to such things. There was a popular scent called Tabu, there was Sorcery, My Sin, Vampire, Voodoo, Evening in Paris, Jungle Gardenia, Bandit, Shocking, Intimate, Love Potion, and l\u2019Heure Bleue - The Blue Hour. Nowadays what do we find? Vanderbilt, Miss Dior, Lauren, and Armani, perfumes named after glorified tailors, names that evoke not the poetic, the erotic, the magic, but economic status, social snobbery, and the egomania of designers. Perfumes that confuse the essence of creation with the essence of money. How much sustenance can the soul receive from a scent entitled Bill Blass? Tim Robbins is preaching to the choir in my case, and he is guilty from time to time of becoming too enamored of his debating skills, ignoring the need for pacing, character development and an actual plot, but I am real glad I discovered him through the pages of this novel, reminiscent to me of the more \u2018serious\u2019 offers of another favorite author: Christopher Moore in \u201cLamb\u201d or \u201cSacre Bleu\u201d. I plan to read more of Robbins\u2019 books, and I hope they will be filled with the same extravaganza of satire and philosophy.Here are the rest of the aphorisms that I salvaged from my mangel-wurzel journey: If a person has an \u201cactive\u201d life, if a person has goals, ideals, a cause to fight for, then that person is distracted, temporarily, from paying a whole lot of attention to the heavy scimitar that hangs by a mouse hair just above his or her head. We, each of us, have a ticket to ride, and if the trip be interesting (if it\u2019s dull, we have only ourselves to blame), then we relish the landscape (how quickly it whizzes by!), interact with our fellow travelers, pay frequent visits to the washrooms and concession stands, and hardly ever hold up the ticket to the light where we can read its plainly stated destination: The Abyss. >><<>><< It\u2019s been a huge adventure, an exploration of possibility, the invention of a game and the play of the game \u2013 and not merely survival. >><<>><< So make your perfume, my friends. Make it well. Breathe properly. Stay curious. And eat your beets. >><<>><< Philosophers have argued for centuries about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but materialists have known all along that it depends on whether they are jitterbugging or dancing cheek to cheek. >><<>><< Theese dance she make zee blood happy, zee bones happy. I don\u2019t know how to explain eet, but theese dance she celebrate that we are not, you know, died already.  (Effecto Partido, the Argentine accordion virtuoso)>><<>><< Live by the heart if you would live forever!"], ["Tom Robbins is, to me, like the band Rush (I know this seems like I'm trying too hard, but honestly, this is the best analogy I can come up with & this is legitmately the first thing that came to mind): You like them ok, and even get a bit excited when they come up on the radio, but when you're grabbing CDs for your car, your copy of \"Moving Pictures\" somehow never quite makes the cut. That's how it is with me and Tom Robbins. Well written? Check. Interesting characters? Check. Unique? Double check. Glad I read the book? Check...But somehow this is all never enough to get me to grab his next book off the shelf. Robbins is one of my wife's favorite authors, and I can see why, but somehow his work just doesn't grab me on a long-term basis. Still though - great book.

This is my first Robbins so I don't know what his other novels are like, but we're talking about an exceptionally charismatic writer here. Robbins takes a bunch of ingredients totally unrelated to one another and makes a story that's as unique as it is brilliant. Beets, horny gods, perfumes, ancient and modern history, eternal life, philosophy and sex. Not the cheesy, romantic kind of sex, but the raw, primitive and full of body fluids one. These are the basic ingredients that he uses to make a story both unforgettable and dreamy. History-wise, Robbins has certainly done his homework. It seems like he knows what he talks about when it comes to ancient and medieval times. The icing on the cake was the masterful use of humor to communicate his rather heretic ideas about pretty much everything. And of course his depiction of the afterlife is simply genius. To make a long story short, this is great stuff which I'll definitely be checking out more of."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "The Wonderful World of Collecting Perfume Bottles, a book about perfume bottles and fragrances, will tell of a commercial endeavor that would become so significant that no other glass form has produced such a profusion of design, pattern, shape, and elegant presentation.

Another theme is about conflicts between modern, post-modern, and traditional in national/cultural communities. A couple years ago, i saw a performance (can't remember the name of the group) about global citizens who were at home everywhere but yet had no home anywhere, who resided in between cultures and places. It was simultaneously lonely and infinitely connected. I related on a certain level.Authors like Khaled Hosseini, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Andrew Lam write about these experiences--I'd say with a perfect mix of joy, sadness, and a floating tinge of alienation and maybe-not-quote-belongingness. I don't claim that my experiences are similar, but the struggles they write about resonate with some of my own struggles with connection and disconnection from the rural, anabaptist religious culture I grew up out of.I've heard Andrew Lam speak and write about the Vietnam of his childhood, the Vietnam of Vietnamese expatriate communities in San Jose and elsewhere, and the Vietnam he sees when he returns to visit and write. Lam has an excellent grasp of the complicated emotions and contradictions, the connections and disconnections, the ridiculousness and seriousness of his experiences -- and he writes about it in ways that resonate.This book surprised me. I wanted to learn more about diasporas, about Vietnam, about emigration and immigration, and I did. But deeper than that, I also learned (to the point of tears) about commonality and resonance along with the difference between my life and Andrew Lam's writing. And that's gifted writing."], ["At first I was worried that this book might centralize a bruised machismo, not only because the author is male but because his father is a former southern Vietnamese war general, which could have lead to a lateral drawn-out story of redemption. Lam instead writes well on the complexities of \"becoming\" that grapple with a new language and Western modernization, and opportunities of creative expression or reinventing, while being sensitive to filial duties, acts of betrayal, dismantling Confucian schema, and departure from Vietnamese notions of attachment to land. Vietnam has always fought foreign domination, a millenium of Chinese rule and then French colonization; yet we've come to today and there exists a Western aspiration entrenched with industrial capitalism (perhaps some democracy). Lam and all of us can admit that Vietnam is not the same as in our memories, or in our parents' memories, and there is inevitable tendency to learn to let go of the yearning that holds us back. Speaking to family ties and the deep incorporation of mortality, \"In Vietnam, death is not the end of relationships, it only deepens them.\""], ["I'm officially in love with Andrew Lam's words. In this memoir, Lam's exquisite way of navigating worlds as the global villager, from San Francisco to Paris to Hanoi and back to childhood Dalat, is parceled into the finest of lines and paragraphs. That he becomes public in English, a third language, French and Vietnamese his first languages, is phenomenal. The hard edges of truths and realizations are blurred only by Lam's lyrical abilities, which allow him and us to peer more deeply into the life of the child and the eventual man, before and since the fall of Saigon."], ["since i wrote it, i suppose i'm a bit bias. Lol..."], ["As the son of a vietnamese refugee in France, the topic of this book was obviously appealing to me, though it focuses more on the vietnamese diaspora in the USA. Literature about the aftermaths of the Vietnam War for the southern (losing) side remains scarce and so far I know, the authors generally speaking from an american or north-vietnamese/communist narrative.  I do no think, that a similar book has ever been written about the vietnamese diaspora in France (though France is, if I am not wrong, hosting the second largest vietnamese community in the West, after America) and it was therefore even more relevant for me to read this book, to be able to compare with my own experience both diasporas. Though, the two of them find their roots in the defeated south vietnamese republic, their natures remain different, due among other things to the different paradigmas of both host countries (american \"communautarism\" vs french \"assimilationism\"), but also to the fact that unlike the USA, France did not host as much veterans of south vietnamese army, but rather people from the civil society. Some also say, that the presence of a strong communist party in France prevented the formation of an organized south vietnamese front against Hanoi's regime. To the book itself, it was a pleasant reading: quite short, but well structured, though I do not necessarly share the views of Andrew Lam about identities (I am far from being a \"cosmopolitan\"). This last point, however, does not constitute the core of the book and I rather focused on similar experiences (the \"loser\" narrative, family members living in the past and dreaming of a country that does not exist anymore, the struggle to make oneself a place in the host country, the traumas of war and exile), but also on differences (for example the strong desire of revenge of vietnamese-americans is not as widely spread or not as expressed by french vietnameses, or the rejection for the host country, similar to the one of Andrew Lam's father, hardly exist, french society being quite demanding for assimilation, or the absence in America of this schism between the first wave of vietnamese immigrants in 1954 who chose France at the end of the colonial time in the one hand, and the second wave after 1975 and the fall of the South, both generations facing mutual misunderstandings or even sometimes mutual disdain).  For some reasons, I found this book to be a very additional lecture to two other books: 1) \"Vietnam: A portrait of its people at war\" from David Chanoff, that also deals with the aftermaths of the vietnamese civil war (and not only with memories from the battlefields), seen from the \"winning side\" (Northern Vietnamese and southern communists). 2) \"Vietnam: Rising Dragon\" by Bill Hayton, since Andrew Lam approaches in one of the last chapters modern Vietnam, a new society, a new generation and different problems, far from those, our parents, citizen of the former South Vietnamese Republic experienced, but also way different from the western vision of Vietnam, made either of war images or idealized as a traditional and rustic asian society. The book from Hayton will go further in details on this topic and depict you a portrait of modern Vietnam."], ["HEARTFELTLam's writing is deeply moving. Going beneath an often impenetrable silence Lam reincarnates with passion, not only for himself and his family, but for many others as well, what it `feels' like to be an immigrant in America from Vietnam.

Trying to assimilate in American culture by telling wartime stories to assume popularity with classmates...tear-jerking, along with his first act of betrayal asking his brother, \"Are you sure that's what you want me to say?\" ...I had to laugh here however... reminded me so much of something I would have done/asked.

Also enclosed in this volume are a series of short stories, essays, travelogues, and other random snippets, some of which date back over a decade, and most of which have little to do with the next entry, except they were all written by Adams.How, then, to review this book? How does one go about commenting on a collection of miscellanea the author never intended to exist in single-volume form? How does one offer criticism on a draft of an unfinished novel? Indeed, how does one offer any insight into a bricolage of material that, pessimistically, smacks of the publishing industry's frantic attempts to make one last posthumous dollar off of a popular writer?I answer through a personal narrative. Any review ever published is, of course, subjective. This one is more so than even most. There's your grain of salt.My wife bought me this book for my birthday, and I took it with me when I flew home (alone; my wife wasn't able to accompany me) the next week to visit my parents. I read the entire book in one day as I shuffled between airplanes and ticket counters, fast-food stands and uncomfortable plastic seats. Much of what appeared in Salmon... was completely new to me, as I'd somehow never read Adams' shorter works--only his novels. But in short, I was both entranced and maddened: the former at the brilliant intelligence and humor that marble-streaked its way through the pages; the latter at the frustratingly incomplete Dirk Gently novel (imagine if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had only written the first half of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" before suddenly perishing, or if Shakespeare had never completed \"Romeo and Juliet\"). I saw in Salmon... sides of Adams both familiar to me, as in his intelligent satire, and unfamiliar, as in the extemporaneous and atheistic speech he delivered at Cambridge, sections of which forced me to close the cover temporarily while I pondered my own thoughts about the nature of God. Most importantly, through all of these scattered scribblings I saw the inner workings of a man who truly, admirably loved life. And as I turned the last page and stared helplessly at the blank sheet before me, and realized that I had just read the last \"book\" Adams would ever \"publish,\" I was overcome with a sadness so deep and painful that I've never yet been able to even pull Salmon... off of the shelf again, much less read it.Douglas Adams never knew I existed: we never met, exchanged correspondence, or even caught a glimpse of one another in a crowded airport. Yet I consider this man one of my dearest mentors, a man whose writing has shaped the last fifteen years of my life in areas too varied and extensive to number. How then to review a book like this? Simply put, I can't. I'm too close. Even now, five years after the only time I managed to read Salmon..., and six years after Adams' death, I'm too close.Why, then, do I give this book five stars?How could I not?"], ["It's really amazing the amounts of nostalgia that can build up in a person's system before it kinda explodes into a kind of reverse word soup full of interviews, introductions, epilogues, and snippets of novels we wish we had but they were never penned because the author up and died on us.I'm writing of Douglas Adams, of course. I almost didn't re-read this one because I remember it WAS mostly just magazine articles and interesting early computer-tech stuff and ruminations on science, god, and other random bits that fly out of this wonderful man's brain in tightly humorous one-liners that explain not only life, the universe, and everything, but also the way his mind works... and this is all DESPITE the fact that Mr. DNA may or may not have had a functional nose with which to sneeze out those humorous one-liners.So am I rating this entirely based on a man's ability to be clear, funny, horribly learned, and dead?Yes, but it's gotta be more than that, and indeed it is. I loved the man.I grew up reading and re-reading HHGttG about a bazillion times with or without the cheese sandwhich, playing countless hours on the Infrogames title of the same name being simultaneously corrupted and flabbergasted by my inability to create NO TEA, and learning how to fly by distraction.I even decided when I was fourteen that I'd grow a beard for the distinct purpose of giving some poor hapless creature a traveling burial site to not see the rest of the world through.DNA is that kind of man to me.This book reminds me of just how regular a human he is and it is an unabashedly wonderful nostalgia piece to boot. Oh, and we also get a few short stories including Ghengis Kahn, a non-presidential Zaphod, and the opening to the next Dirk Gently book which would have been fantastic, I'm sure, had he written it.*sigh*Still, what a wonderful thing it is. Farewell, Mr. Adams. (Yes. I know I'm 16 years late. It's just that this book was compiled shortly after his death, so I feel it fresh. Sue me.)"], ["I waited sixteen-and-a-half years to read this and I just about managed to get through it without bawling my eyes out. Douglas Adams was the first author to make me laugh uproariously, back when I was a wee nipper. Sure, Roald Dahl had given me a few chuckles, but it wasn't until I read Hitchhikers for the first time that I realised a book could make me laugh so much I nearly wet myself.As such, this was a bittersweet experience. Reading Adams' unpublished work, including several chapters of a new but never to be finished Dirk Gently novel, gave a new definition to laughing through one's tears. I'm glad I read it but it's going to take a while to recover. It's a good job I had my towel..."], ["This technically is the 3rd book in the Dirk Gently series. Sadly, it's not really a Dirk Gently book. You see, before Douglas Adams could write/finish this third book, he died of a sudden heart attack in a gym in Santa Barbara in 2001.But he left behind fragments of chapters or chapters and their rewritings and a lot of other notes on his various computers. His wife, daughter, agent, editor, assistant and other people then pieced together what is now The Salmon of Doubt which would have been the title of the third book.This book is divided into three parts:1) Life2) The Universe3) And Everythingwhich is a tribute to his Hitchhiker book(s).There is much more in this book than simply another story (or the beginning of one). The first two parts are filled with snippets, random thoughts DA wrote down about tea and cookies and computers and other stuff, interviews for various magazines and newspapers he did, as well as speeches he gave for all sorts of occasions.For example, did you know how much Douglas Adams got involved with environmentalism? Yes, this giant (literally) of a man did not just love all things Apple, but thanks to a trip done with biologist Mark Carwardine, he also became a staunch defender of bio-diversity. Most notably, he loved and tried to protect rhinos. He even climbed the Kilimandscharo in a rhino costume in order to raise money for \"Save the Rhino\" (a wildlife conservation organisation). Here he is:Naturally, it was much more of an ordeal than he had originally thought, which he explains in his very unique hilarious way (seriously, I almost suffocated when reading his account of that trip).My favourite story though is of the cookies. Here it is:This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I\u2019d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It\u2019s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here\u2019s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There\u2019s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There\u2019s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know\u2026 But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn\u2019t do anything, and thought, \"What am I going to do?\"In the end I thought \"Nothing for it, I\u2019ll just have to go for it.\", and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, \"That settled him.\" But it hadn\u2019t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. \u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2026\u201d I mean, it doesn\u2019t really work.We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.Typically British. And, strangely, or not so strangely because it's typical DA, a perfect anecdote about life.This book, therefore, grants a unique insight into the author's mind, his anxiety that sometimes bordered on depression, his early years and struggle, the sudden fame and success, the maddening battle with Hollywood, his private life even. And it shows how beloved and respected he was by family, friends and colleagues. I mean, Stephen Fry penned the Foreword and Richard Dawkins the Epilogue! Just the list of people he knew and often also how he got to know them is staggering.Alas, this is the end. So to speak. Fortunately, I can look forward to reading the 4 other Hitchhiker volumes as I haven't read those yet. It's amazing what kind of a legacy this man left behind (not just through his books, but also radio programmes, BBC contributions, movies, TV shows etc).Trigger Warning:This book is sometimes difficult to read; at least to those people who mourn the author, or generally feel for people who have to cope with sudden loss. It sure made me cry at certain points."], ["In early 1998 (or was it \u201897?), I experienced one of the most heady experiences of my life. A literary idol approached me at a conference we were attending in France (it was in Cannes, but it was a media festival rather than the more famous annual event), invited me to join him at dinner and debate the existence of God. Douglas Adams, self-proclaimed radical atheist, wanted to consider God\u2019s existence (or lack thereof) with me. As a minister, I\u2019d like to write myself in as the hero and claim that I at least put a dent in the famous atheist\u2019s armor. We had a fascinating conversation and I\u2019d like to think that I pushed him into rethinking his position, but that\u2019s not very realistic. Hang on! This does relate to this collection of Adams\u2019 writing in his last years, especially those reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt.In our discussion, I pulled out the well-worn rubber duck of apologetics. I told him that he was dishonest in calling himself an atheist instead of an agnostic. I didn\u2019t realize that this was the most offensive opening I could try. I hadn\u2019t read his interview with American Atheists where he asserted that Agnostic did not adequately express his position because he was \u201cconvinced that there is no God.\u201d (p. 96) But I blundered into the conversation with my classic approach that it is intellectual arrogance to claim to \u201cknow\u201d that there is no God by appealing to an illustration in one of Rudy Rucker\u2019s books on multidimensionality. This took my literary hero off guard because \u201cmultidimensionality\u201d was a great fascination for him. I told him that certainty of the non-existence of God might well be trying to decide a multidimensional issue via the limited dimensions we have discovered in our empirical science. Then, I conceded that being \u201cconvinced\u201d was different than \u201cknowing,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t objectively any better than a person of faith being \u201cconvinced.\u201d I scored the opening round a stand-off. I\u2019m not sure what Adams would have scored it. He must have been somewhat satisfied because he shifted gears.He told me that there was no rational need for the existence of God. This, of course, is a different question. Unlike my typical sermon, I opted to walk the tightrope of suggested that God is a useful concept\u2014EVEN (don\u2019t be horrified at my speculation, true believers) if a personal God didn\u2019t exist. I told him that I personally believe in a personal God, but for purposes of discussion, we should consider whether there really was no rational need for the existence of God. I asserted that, contrary to Adams\u2019 hero Richard Dawkins for whom I expressed admiration for his science and reservation for his assertions which went beyond the acceptable evidence, the idea of God was more helpful than harmful.Adams was skeptical (duh!) and attempted two analogies which I found interesting. He pulled some British currency out of his wallet and suggested that burning it wouldn\u2019t warm you, eating it wouldn\u2019t feed you, and wearing it wouldn\u2019t cover you, but that it had purchasing power because the state stood behind it. But, he suggested that you need the assurance that the state exists in order for the currency to have any effect whatsoever. I countered (maybe a feeble parry at best) that, for the bulk of the British population, they had no idea of the nature of money supply, national deficit, budget viability, and governmental oversight of that currency but had an essential faith in the government. One doesn\u2019t have to have all of the economics behind the currency explained satisfactorily in order to use the money. In the same way, one doesn\u2019t have to understand everything about God in order to benefit from the idea of God. Therefore, there may well be a rational need for God. Before I explain the next analogy, imagine my amazement to see the late 1998 speech from Adams that was reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt: \u201cMoney is a completely fictitious entity, but it\u2019s very powerful in our world; we all have wallets, which have got notes in them, but what can these notes do? You can\u2019t breed them, you can\u2019t stir-fry them, you can\u2019t live in them, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do with them, other than exchange them with each other\u2014and as soon as we exchange them with each other, all sorts of powerful things happen, because it\u2019s a fiction that we\u2019ve all subscribed to. \u2026if the money vanished, the entire cooperative structure that we have would implode.\u201d (p. 140) Did our discussion bear fruit? Adams didn\u2019t change his mind about the existence of God. He merely recognized the utility of the concept of God. Egotistically, I had thought to convince him one step at a time, but perhaps, I merely pushed him to fortify and develop his philosophical position to allow for a utilitarian (he called it \u201cartificial\u201d) God. The conversation was still stimulating, especially so when Adams began to expound about Feng Shui. Now, maybe I wasn\u2019t listening, but I thought he was expressing skepticism about Feng Shui, so I said that it wouldn\u2019t really make any different that he and I don\u2019t believe that dragons exist, but that the concept of the dragon may help people design more comfortable and functional living spaces even if no dragon ever sets foot in the dwelling (and presumably they would not). Therefore, I suggested that even if I was wrong about the personal God whom I serve, my life may be better and more meaningful as a result of my conceptual idea of God\u2019s involvement in my life. Now, admittedly, Adams\u2019 hero of evolutionary arrogance (Richard Dawkins) wouldn\u2019t concede this as said individual perceives the very concept to be harmful due to the fundamentalist extremes which have wreaked havoc in human history, but it seemed like the approach caused Adams to pause. Again, that could be arrogance on my part. I WISH I had impacted Adams and this could merely be wish-fulfillment. However, I was delighted to read on p. 146: \u201cYou figure out how the dragon\u2019s going to be happy here, and lo, and behold, you\u2019ve suddenly got a place that makes sense for other organic creatures, such as ourselves, to live in.\u201d Do I think I won a debate with this man who was, in so many ways, my intellectual superior? Naaah! I just like to think that our conversation pushed him in a direction he was already considering. Do I wish I could have convinced him of the existence of a personal God who cared about Him and wanted to be involved in his life and life\u2019s work? Absolutely! Do I still admire him as a person and his creative output? Absolutely!There were a few other lines that I really enjoyed in this book of essays, interviews, introductions to books, albums, and concerts, speeches, and rambling thoughts before I got into what I really procured the book to read, the last Dirk Gently story. I loved his line about art when he said, \u201cI think the idea of art kills creativity.\u201d (p. 158) And, I loved the story about his awkward experience in the train station with the cookies (pp. 150-151). It appears that he was sharing a table while waiting for a train. He had his coffee and a packet of cookies along with his morning newspaper. As he was reading his paper, the fellow reached over, opened the bag of cookies, too one out and began to eat it. Some British reserve kept him from confronting the man for his effrontery, so they actually ate the cookies in uncomfortable silence one-for-one. When the man left, Adams moved his paper and discovered an identical, but unopened bag of cookies under his paper. He was amused that he had thought so ill of the man while he was erroneously consuming the other man\u2019s cookies. And he knew why this had occurred, but the other man never discovered the punch line. In the U.S., of course, there would have been a loud vocal confrontation at the very least. As for the title piece, the bare-bones portion of the unfinished Salmon of Doubt, it was delightful\u2014even in its admittedly unpolished form. I followed the tortured logic of the cabbie who assumed that since people said, \u201cFollow that cab!\u201d in the movies and he, having had a long tenure as a cabbie had never heard that phrase, he must indeed have been the cab that all other cabs were following (pp. 249-250). I rolled my eyes with empathy when Dirk discovered a freezer cabinet full of \u201cold, white, clenched things that he was now too frightened to try to identify.\u201d (p. 226) I chuckled at the description of Gently\u2019s office that was \u201cold and dilapidated and remained standing more out of habit rather than from any inherent structural integrity\u201d (p. 238) I really loved the slam on typical airline personnel speak (Airline Syllable Stress Syndrome\u2014p. 253). I was sad that the book wasn\u2019t complete, even in its current form."], ["What a delight to revisit the mind of Douglas Adams. I like that this is a collection of emails, speeches, one-liners, and rants. Yes, there's the start of a novel in there, that he may or may not have intended to call the Salmon of Doubt. The result is so much better than it sounds like it's going to be: Douglas Adams died, but his buddy knew his password and emptied his Mac onto a CD, the various unfinished writings were lightly edited and printed as this. But gosh, am I ever glad that they did, because there's some exceptional writing in here, hilARious, as he always was, and glitteringly insightful. His projections on the future of technology, from the 90's, are pretty brilliant, and the piece de resistance is the speech to Cambridge on the purpose of God."], ["A collection of essays, speeches, ramblings unearthed on his hard drive(s), one short story culled from a BBC annual, and the titular unfinished Dirk Gently novel.

There are some readers, yours included, who feel Adams spent himself on the Hitchhiker\u2019s books: although the Dirk Gentlys were absurdist romps sutured with awesome logic, they didn\u2019t hang together as novels. The short excerpt from The Salmon of Doubt, however, might prove me wrong: the usual warmth and humour is present, although in nascent form, (the narration even slips from third into first person, a sign of Adams\u2019s dissatisfaction).

Salmon isn't that collection; the writings are just tossed into poorly-defined buckets with no real TOC to speak of (and let us not speak of indexes), and there's no real way to tell what's missing or what's even important.

Maybe I just wanted more of the idiot and less of the incomprehensible mystic in systems-theory sheep's clothing. What can I say?

Since the answers to the three questions were, I knew immediately, yes, no, and maybe, I realised I could then take the rest of my career off.\u201dBooks by  Oscar Wilde,  Terry Pratchett and  Douglas Adams have (at least) one thing in common. I can easily pick funny, witty, interesting quotes from every page. The above quote represents Adams\u2019 surreal sense of humour quite nicely, I think.Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is of course, Douglas Adams\u2019 lesser known series, compared to the incomparable (but often compared to) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. Still, there are only five \u201cHitchhiker's\u201d books, excluding Eoin Colfer's  And Another Thing..., which\u2014in all fairness\u2014I have not read, but I am not that big a fan of Colfer's  Artemis Fowl, so the idea of a sequel by him is a nonstarter for me.So how does Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency compare to  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? What kind of question is that? Damn you! (Sorry, I\u2019m feeling a bit schizophrenic). Anyway, the answer to that question would be \u201cfavorably\u201d. It does not have the epic space opera setting of Hitchhiker's, but then Adams wanted to write something different rather than retread old ground so the smaller scale of the setting is understandable.Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is not really about the eponymous Dirk Gently\u2019s, I would not even call him the protagonist. He is one of the central characters. As the book has to be called something the title Adams went with is a suitably intriguing one. The plot of the novel is a combination of several seemingly unrelated plot strands. It starts with an \u201cElectric Monk\u201d looking for a Door (the capital D distinguishes from any old door), then the scene switches to a dinner at St. Cedd's College in Cambridge where Professor Urban Chronotis performs a seemingly commonplace magic trick is for a child. Soon after that a horse is found in the professor\u2019s bathroom. A wealthy businessman is shot dead for no reason, and his ghost starts to roam. An alien spacecraft accidentally lands and soon blows up.The disparate plotlines are actually interrelated, and the only man who can find the connection between them is Dirk Gently, the world\u2019s first \u201cHolistic Detective\u201d, which means that he understands \u201cthe fundamental interconnectedness of all things\u201d. Sherlock Holmes famously said \u201cOnce you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth\u201d, Dirk Gently goes one better by not even eliminating the impossible (see one of the selected quotes below). His ability to make intuitive leaps verges on being a superpower.Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency reminds me a little bit of Kurt Vonnegut's  Breakfast of Champions, another novel with different plotlines that seem to bear no relation to each other. I thought that was a bit of a mess, but a funny, admirable and beautiful one by the time I finished it. \u201cDirk Gently\u2019s\u201d is similarly messy, but the eponymous Dirk untangles all the plot strands by the end of the book. For the most part, it is easy enough to follow, and always funny, but the climax and denouement are a little convoluted. If your attention strayed during some seemingly unimportant scenes some of the expositions at the end may be confusing. For the most part Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency is a madcap surreal comic novel with a lot of sci-fi elements that you can expect from Douglas Adams. However, a shade of sadness, melancholy and loneliness permeate the last few chapters of the book.The characters are mostly well developed, with Dirk, being the standout due to his eccentricity and superhuman intuition. Not far behind is the enigmatic Professor Urban Chronotis who is much more than he seems, and he also appears in  Doctor Who: Shada, based on Adams\u2019 Doctor Who TV episode script.If you are a fan of  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy but have read all the books already you should not miss this book. On the other hand\u2014or perhaps the same hand but different fingers\u2014if you have not read all the \u201cHitchhiker's\u201d books, or have not read any, or never heard of Douglas Adams, you should still not miss this book.

Sure, he had a dry wit, but also a mind as sharp as a katana and the observations about humanity that he put into his books, while being disguised as silly dialogue or even sillier happenings, are always very deep, reflective and spot-on.So this story is about the titular Dirk Gently, although that is only the most recent in a long list of names he's used. He doesn't even make an appearance for the first quarter of the book, actually. Mr. Gently believes in the interconnectedness of all things, therefore he named his detective agency \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\".It's this interconnectedness that has to be proven when a former friend of his with a sofa being stuck halfway up the way to his apartment gets bored half to death at the annual reading of a Coleridge poem (THE Coleridge poem, I should say) at Cambridge university, then witnesses a conjuring trick by one of his old professors, finds a horse in the bathroom of that same professor (after it finally got rid of its rider, an Electric Monk), and finally gets caught up in a very weird murder involving his boss, followed by people acting strangely indeed. You're confused? Good!It's a bit like watching Doctor Who and getting all of your brain in a tight knot, but you know exactly that it will all make perfect sense in the end.As I said, silliness abound in DA's book, but all the silliness serves a purpose and that is what makes this book not only entertaining, but actually intellectually challenging and bloody perfect! Especially eccentric Dirk Gently himself with his weirdness actually makes perfect sense - it's the world that is bonkers.Thus we end up with gems like the following (some of my favourite bits that I marked in the book):Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.It is difficult to be sat on all day, every day, by some other creature, without forming an opinion about them.On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to sit all day, every day, on top of another creature and not have the slightest thought about them whatsoever.So two legs were held to be both more suitable and cheaper than the more normal primes of seventeen, nineteen or twenty-three; the skin the Monks were given was pinkish-looking instead of purple, soft and smooth instead of crenellated. They were also restricted to just one mouth and nose, but were given instead an additional eye, making for a grand total of two. A strange-looking creature indeed. But truly excellent at believing the most preposterous things.She tried to worry that something had happened to him, but didn't believe it for a moment. Nothing terrible ever happened to him, though she was beginning to think that it was time it damn well did. If nothing terrible happened to him soon maybe she'd do it herself.... coincidences are strange and dangerous things.... there is a huge difference between disliking somebody - maybe even disliking them a lot - and actually shooting them, strangling them, dragging them through the fields and setting their house on fire. It was a difference which kept the vast majority of the population alive from day to day.This was a public telephone so it was clearly an oversight that it was working at all.Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasn't developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we don't expect to see?... normal English condition, that of a damp and rancid dish cloth ...... he believed with an instant effortlessness which would have impressed even a Scientologist.\"It disturbs me very greatly when I find that I know things and do not know why I know them. Maybe it is the same instinctive processing of data that allows you to catch a ball almost before you've seen it. Maybe it is the deeer and less explicable instinct that tells you when someone is watching you.\"\"And Mrs. Roberts? How is she? Foot still troubling her?\"\"Not since she had it off, thanks for asking, sir. Between you and me, sir, I would've been just as happy to have had her amputated and kept the foot. I had a little spot reserved on the mantlepiece, but there we are, we have to take things as we find them.\"The cry \"I could have thought of that\" is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didn't, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too.\"Charitable, ha!\" said Dirk. \"I pay my taxes, what more do you want?\"One thing I could also identify with immensely was this description of Susan:She had an amazing emotional self-sufficiancy and control provided she could play her cello. He had noticed an odd and extraordinary thing about her relationship with the music she played. If ever she was feeling emotional or upset she could sit and play some music with utter concentration and emerge seeming fresh and calm.Only in my case the cello has to be replaced by books and playing music by reading. But yes, a very precise description of me.Oh, and despite me being too young to know too much about what it was like with the very first computers being sold, it was so cool to read about all the technical stuff because I know from interviews and Neil Gaiman's biography of Douglas Adams what a techie / computer enthusiast he was (plus, from a historical point of view alone it must have been pretty exciting).So you see, not just a thrilling writing style with engaging and quirky characters, but also wit dry enough to start a wildfire that illuminates a wide range of important topics, making the reader not only laugh but also reflect, all while you're having the time of your life.Honestly, no idea why this is rated lower than Hitchhiker, because despite me being a huge fan (I even bought a towel and stitched \"42\" and \"Don't Panic!\" onto it and carry it with me every Towel Day), I am firmly sold on Dirk Gently and think this first volume beats the first of the 5 volumes in the Hitchhiker trilogy."], ["From the title you would think this is possibly about a detective agency. Well there is an agency but they don\u2019t detect things in the normal matter. You should probably guess that since it is a Douglas Adams book and when has he written anything really normal (I mean that in the best way).Nope for this book \n\u201cLet's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.\u201d\nThere is craziness, absurdity, the interconnectedness of all things and Dirk is smack dab in the middle of it all. He will somehow figure out how a horse in a bathroom, a ghost making telephone calls, a undoable magic trick, the cat in Schrodinger\u2019s Box and an alien electronic monk who can believe anything all have to do with one another.It is a crazy and fantastic ride that if you just hang back and not think about it too much everything will just all into place. Most of the time Dirk Gently seems to make no sense until he makes hysterical sense. There were times I flat out belly laughed at some of the general obscurity of it.I will never think of Sir Isaac Newton the same again \u2013 or Bach but that is a different matter. \u201cSir Isaac Newton, renowned inventor of the milled-edge coin and the catflap!\"\"The what?\" said Richard.\"The catflap! A device of the utmost cunning, perspicuity and invention. It is a door within a door, you see, a ...\"\"Yes,\" said Richard, \"there was also the small matter of gravity.\"\"Gravity,\" said Dirk with a slightly dismissed shrug, \"yes, there was that as well, I suppose. Though that, of course, was merely a discovery. It was there to be discovered.\" ... \"You see?\" he said dropping his cigarette butt, \"They even keep it on at weekends. Someone was bound to notice sooner or later. But the catflap ... ah, there is a very different matter. Invention, pure creative invention. It is a door within a door, you see.\u201dI read both the Dirk Gently books years ago and they are some of the few books that I come back to years later and love for different reasons all over again. If you were a fan of the Hitchhikers series or Monty Python then this kind of humor might be exactly what you need for a good laugh."], ["I recently watched the pilot episode of Dirk Gently and loved it. So, naturally, I picked up the book. Now this order of doing things is often frowned upon by many people, including me, but sometimes things just happen. The reason I'm telling you this is that I was slightly let down by the book, having seen (a version of) Dirk Gently in action before reading about him. There just wasn't enough of the detective in the book, while he (both versions) is such an interesting character. And yes, it was a fun little book, but felt a bit random and not as interconnected as it should have been, considering the holistic approach Dirk promotes.Also, having looked into some other reviews before writing my own, I have to say that a) I'm not going to touch on the Pratchett vs. Adams thing, but the seemingly random scenes in the beginning of the book and the time it took to actually reach the main character did remind me of many Discworld novels (nothing original about that technique, just saying). b) The Doctor Who connection - it's certainly strong, then again I'm a Doctor Who maniac. But I think it's safe to say that those of us who can't wait until the next Doctor Who episode (September!) will certainly enjoy Dirk Gently's company."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "Hank Easton's former lover doesn't hesitate to call him when her latest companion dies from what appears to be a severe beating.

Twelve chapters on how stress is going to kill you, followed by six chapters on why stress is stressful, when it's not, and what we can do about it.If you're a worrier, this may not be the book for you. I won't lie, it upset me in the beginning. There are so many ways that stress can affect your health, your memory, the way you age, how you deal with stressors, and even how your children deal with stressors. The book can become a source of stress itself, one that far outweighs the few methods it gives for dealing with stress. But it addresses a lot of important issues, like the economics of stress and the way poverty and pay inequality have life-long health ramifications. It's not just about stress on a personal level, but a social, cultural, and political one. It also looks at the role stress plays in mental illness, pain, infertility, and addiction.The science can be quite dense at times, but Sapolsky is good at walking you through it and recalling topics he introduced earlier so you never have to feel like you're studying for something. He makes this easy to read, even if the subject is a difficult one. He's a great writer with a sense of humor, an obvious love of science, and respect for views that aren't his own. He offers multiple approaches for any given problem and points out questions we don't have answers for yet.Four stars.

His books, or this one at least, is similarly easy to get into, and manages to discuss topics of fair complexity in an incredibly approachable way. He's clearly aware that his book might be read by a wide range of audiences, and strives to provide something for everyone. I'll definitely be working my way through the rest of his catalog.The book is fascinating, too, although as he notes many times, thinking about and addressing stress is difficult, because trying to act to reduce stress can itself be stressful. As he elucidates what's currently known about the links between stress and disease, a lot of interesting things emerge, some of which are essentially throwaway trivia, like the idea that anti-depressant medication takes a while to work on people that are clinically depressed because of the physiological nature of depression; he doesn't really spell it out, but the obvious corollary is that is someone takes AD medication and instantly feels better, they're probably not actually depressed.

If you're looking for a solid book on recommendations to deal with stress, this might not be it.To the author's credit, he is trying to be as accurate as possible, and therefore I believe he is trying his best to recommend the most scientifically accurate practice to deal with stress; and sadly, there may not be many, although there is a few practical one such as exercise and meditation."], ["This is hands down the best medical book I have ever read.

He outlines how modern stress triggers that have nothing to do with immediate survival - whether brought on from traffic, bad bosses, bad relationships - can be linked to exacerbating the development of almost every modern epidemic from cancer to colitis, depression to dwarfism, diabetes to diarrhea, heart disease to infertility to immune disorders. The book concludes with some stories about coping with stress, and the unique psychological profiles of the people who avoid the development of stress-related diseases and experience health improvements with aging in a process he calls \u201csuccessful aging.\u201d"], ["Gostei muito do primeiro livro do Robert Sapolsky, o Mem\u00f3rias de um Primata.

Besides the Wright brothers, there are many others who are often less recognized.

Also enclosed in this volume are a series of short stories, essays, travelogues, and other random snippets, some of which date back over a decade, and most of which have little to do with the next entry, except they were all written by Adams.How, then, to review this book? How does one go about commenting on a collection of miscellanea the author never intended to exist in single-volume form? How does one offer criticism on a draft of an unfinished novel? Indeed, how does one offer any insight into a bricolage of material that, pessimistically, smacks of the publishing industry's frantic attempts to make one last posthumous dollar off of a popular writer?I answer through a personal narrative. Any review ever published is, of course, subjective. This one is more so than even most. There's your grain of salt.My wife bought me this book for my birthday, and I took it with me when I flew home (alone; my wife wasn't able to accompany me) the next week to visit my parents. I read the entire book in one day as I shuffled between airplanes and ticket counters, fast-food stands and uncomfortable plastic seats. Much of what appeared in Salmon... was completely new to me, as I'd somehow never read Adams' shorter works--only his novels. But in short, I was both entranced and maddened: the former at the brilliant intelligence and humor that marble-streaked its way through the pages; the latter at the frustratingly incomplete Dirk Gently novel (imagine if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had only written the first half of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" before suddenly perishing, or if Shakespeare had never completed \"Romeo and Juliet\"). I saw in Salmon... sides of Adams both familiar to me, as in his intelligent satire, and unfamiliar, as in the extemporaneous and atheistic speech he delivered at Cambridge, sections of which forced me to close the cover temporarily while I pondered my own thoughts about the nature of God. Most importantly, through all of these scattered scribblings I saw the inner workings of a man who truly, admirably loved life. And as I turned the last page and stared helplessly at the blank sheet before me, and realized that I had just read the last \"book\" Adams would ever \"publish,\" I was overcome with a sadness so deep and painful that I've never yet been able to even pull Salmon... off of the shelf again, much less read it.Douglas Adams never knew I existed: we never met, exchanged correspondence, or even caught a glimpse of one another in a crowded airport. Yet I consider this man one of my dearest mentors, a man whose writing has shaped the last fifteen years of my life in areas too varied and extensive to number. How then to review a book like this?

Even now, five years after the only time I managed to read Salmon..., and six years after Adams' death, I'm too close.Why, then, do I give this book five stars?How could I not?"], ["It's really amazing the amounts of nostalgia that can build up in a person's system before it kinda explodes into a kind of reverse word soup full of interviews, introductions, epilogues, and snippets of novels we wish we had but they were never penned because the author up and died on us.I'm writing of Douglas Adams, of course. I almost didn't re-read this one because I remember it WAS mostly just magazine articles and interesting early computer-tech stuff and ruminations on science, god, and other random bits that fly out of this wonderful man's brain in tightly humorous one-liners that explain not only life, the universe, and everything, but also the way his mind works... and this is all DESPITE the fact that Mr. DNA may or may not have had a functional nose with which to sneeze out those humorous one-liners.So am I rating this entirely based on a man's ability to be clear, funny, horribly learned, and dead?Yes, but it's gotta be more than that, and indeed it is. I loved the man.I grew up reading and re-reading HHGttG about a bazillion times with or without the cheese sandwhich, playing countless hours on the Infrogames title of the same name being simultaneously corrupted and flabbergasted by my inability to create NO TEA, and learning how to fly by distraction.I even decided when I was fourteen that I'd grow a beard for the distinct purpose of giving some poor hapless creature a traveling burial site to not see the rest of the world through.DNA is that kind of man to me.This book reminds me of just how regular a human he is and it is an unabashedly wonderful nostalgia piece to boot.

Sadly, it's not really a Dirk Gently book. You see, before Douglas Adams could write/finish this third book, he died of a sudden heart attack in a gym in Santa Barbara in 2001.But he left behind fragments of chapters or chapters and their rewritings and a lot of other notes on his various computers. His wife, daughter, agent, editor, assistant and other people then pieced together what is now The Salmon of Doubt which would have been the title of the third book.This book is divided into three parts:1) Life2) The Universe3) And Everythingwhich is a tribute to his Hitchhiker book(s).There is much more in this book than simply another story (or the beginning of one). The first two parts are filled with snippets, random thoughts DA wrote down about tea and cookies and computers and other stuff, interviews for various magazines and newspapers he did, as well as speeches he gave for all sorts of occasions.For example, did you know how much Douglas Adams got involved with environmentalism? Yes, this giant (literally) of a man did not just love all things Apple, but thanks to a trip done with biologist Mark Carwardine, he also became a staunch defender of bio-diversity. Most notably, he loved and tried to protect rhinos. He even climbed the Kilimandscharo in a rhino costume in order to raise money for \"Save the Rhino\" (a wildlife conservation organisation). Here he is:Naturally, it was much more of an ordeal than he had originally thought, which he explains in his very unique hilarious way (seriously, I almost suffocated when reading his account of that trip).My favourite story though is of the cookies. Here it is:This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I\u2019d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It\u2019s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here\u2019s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There\u2019s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There\u2019s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know\u2026 But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do a clue in the newspaper, couldn\u2019t do anything, and thought, \"What am I going to do?\"In the end I thought \"Nothing for it, I\u2019ll just have to go for it.\", and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, \"That settled him.\" But it hadn\u2019t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. \u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2026\u201d I mean, it doesn\u2019t really work.We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and sat back.A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line.Typically British. And, strangely, or not so strangely because it's typical DA, a perfect anecdote about life.This book, therefore, grants a unique insight into the author's mind, his anxiety that sometimes bordered on depression, his early years and struggle, the sudden fame and success, the maddening battle with Hollywood, his private life even. And it shows how beloved and respected he was by family, friends and colleagues. I mean, Stephen Fry penned the Foreword and Richard Dawkins the Epilogue! Just the list of people he knew and often also how he got to know them is staggering.Alas, this is the end. So to speak. Fortunately, I can look forward to reading the 4 other Hitchhiker volumes as I haven't read those yet. It's amazing what kind of a legacy this man left behind (not just through his books, but also radio programmes, BBC contributions, movies, TV shows etc).Trigger Warning:This book is sometimes difficult to read; at least to those people who mourn the author, or generally feel for people who have to cope with sudden loss. It sure made me cry at certain points."], ["In early 1998 (or was it \u201897?), I experienced one of the most heady experiences of my life. A literary idol approached me at a conference we were attending in France (it was in Cannes, but it was a media festival rather than the more famous annual event), invited me to join him at dinner and debate the existence of God. Douglas Adams, self-proclaimed radical atheist, wanted to consider God\u2019s existence (or lack thereof) with me. As a minister, I\u2019d like to write myself in as the hero and claim that I at least put a dent in the famous atheist\u2019s armor. We had a fascinating conversation and I\u2019d like to think that I pushed him into rethinking his position, but that\u2019s not very realistic. Hang on! This does relate to this collection of Adams\u2019 writing in his last years, especially those reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt.In our discussion, I pulled out the well-worn rubber duck of apologetics. I told him that he was dishonest in calling himself an atheist instead of an agnostic. I didn\u2019t realize that this was the most offensive opening I could try. I hadn\u2019t read his interview with American Atheists where he asserted that Agnostic did not adequately express his position because he was \u201cconvinced that there is no God.\u201d (p. 96) But I blundered into the conversation with my classic approach that it is intellectual arrogance to claim to \u201cknow\u201d that there is no God by appealing to an illustration in one of Rudy Rucker\u2019s books on multidimensionality. This took my literary hero off guard because \u201cmultidimensionality\u201d was a great fascination for him. I told him that certainty of the non-existence of God might well be trying to decide a multidimensional issue via the limited dimensions we have discovered in our empirical science. Then, I conceded that being \u201cconvinced\u201d was different than \u201cknowing,\u201d but that it wasn\u2019t objectively any better than a person of faith being \u201cconvinced.\u201d I scored the opening round a stand-off. I\u2019m not sure what Adams would have scored it. He must have been somewhat satisfied because he shifted gears.He told me that there was no rational need for the existence of God. This, of course, is a different question. Unlike my typical sermon, I opted to walk the tightrope of suggested that God is a useful concept\u2014EVEN (don\u2019t be horrified at my speculation, true believers) if a personal God didn\u2019t exist. I told him that I personally believe in a personal God, but for purposes of discussion, we should consider whether there really was no rational need for the existence of God. I asserted that, contrary to Adams\u2019 hero Richard Dawkins for whom I expressed admiration for his science and reservation for his assertions which went beyond the acceptable evidence, the idea of God was more helpful than harmful.Adams was skeptical (duh!) and attempted two analogies which I found interesting. He pulled some British currency out of his wallet and suggested that burning it wouldn\u2019t warm you, eating it wouldn\u2019t feed you, and wearing it wouldn\u2019t cover you, but that it had purchasing power because the state stood behind it. But, he suggested that you need the assurance that the state exists in order for the currency to have any effect whatsoever. I countered (maybe a feeble parry at best) that, for the bulk of the British population, they had no idea of the nature of money supply, national deficit, budget viability, and governmental oversight of that currency but had an essential faith in the government. One doesn\u2019t have to have all of the economics behind the currency explained satisfactorily in order to use the money. In the same way, one doesn\u2019t have to understand everything about God in order to benefit from the idea of God. Therefore, there may well be a rational need for God. Before I explain the next analogy, imagine my amazement to see the late 1998 speech from Adams that was reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt: \u201cMoney is a completely fictitious entity, but it\u2019s very powerful in our world; we all have wallets, which have got notes in them, but what can these notes do? You can\u2019t breed them, you can\u2019t stir-fry them, you can\u2019t live in them, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do with them, other than exchange them with each other\u2014and as soon as we exchange them with each other, all sorts of powerful things happen, because it\u2019s a fiction that we\u2019ve all subscribed to. \u2026if the money vanished, the entire cooperative structure that we have would implode.\u201d (p. 140) Did our discussion bear fruit? Adams didn\u2019t change his mind about the existence of God. He merely recognized the utility of the concept of God. Egotistically, I had thought to convince him one step at a time, but perhaps, I merely pushed him to fortify and develop his philosophical position to allow for a utilitarian (he called it \u201cartificial\u201d) God. The conversation was still stimulating, especially so when Adams began to expound about Feng Shui. Now, maybe I wasn\u2019t listening, but I thought he was expressing skepticism about Feng Shui, so I said that it wouldn\u2019t really make any different that he and I don\u2019t believe that dragons exist, but that the concept of the dragon may help people design more comfortable and functional living spaces even if no dragon ever sets foot in the dwelling (and presumably they would not). Therefore, I suggested that even if I was wrong about the personal God whom I serve, my life may be better and more meaningful as a result of my conceptual idea of God\u2019s involvement in my life. Now, admittedly, Adams\u2019 hero of evolutionary arrogance (Richard Dawkins) wouldn\u2019t concede this as said individual perceives the very concept to be harmful due to the fundamentalist extremes which have wreaked havoc in human history, but it seemed like the approach caused Adams to pause. Again, that could be arrogance on my part. I WISH I had impacted Adams and this could merely be wish-fulfillment. However, I was delighted to read on p. 146: \u201cYou figure out how the dragon\u2019s going to be happy here, and lo, and behold, you\u2019ve suddenly got a place that makes sense for other organic creatures, such as ourselves, to live in.\u201d Do I think I won a debate with this man who was, in so many ways, my intellectual superior? Naaah! I just like to think that our conversation pushed him in a direction he was already considering. Do I wish I could have convinced him of the existence of a personal God who cared about Him and wanted to be involved in his life and life\u2019s work? Absolutely! Do I still admire him as a person and his creative output? Absolutely!There were a few other lines that I really enjoyed in this book of essays, interviews, introductions to books, albums, and concerts, speeches, and rambling thoughts before I got into what I really procured the book to read, the last Dirk Gently story. I loved his line about art when he said, \u201cI think the idea of art kills creativity.\u201d (p. 158) And, I loved the story about his awkward experience in the train station with the cookies (pp. 150-151). It appears that he was sharing a table while waiting for a train. He had his coffee and a packet of cookies along with his morning newspaper. As he was reading his paper, the fellow reached over, opened the bag of cookies, too one out and began to eat it. Some British reserve kept him from confronting the man for his effrontery, so they actually ate the cookies in uncomfortable silence one-for-one. When the man left, Adams moved his paper and discovered an identical, but unopened bag of cookies under his paper. He was amused that he had thought so ill of the man while he was erroneously consuming the other man\u2019s cookies. And he knew why this had occurred, but the other man never discovered the punch line. In the U.S., of course, there would have been a loud vocal confrontation at the very least. As for the title piece, the bare-bones portion of the unfinished Salmon of Doubt, it was delightful\u2014even in its admittedly unpolished form. I followed the tortured logic of the cabbie who assumed that since people said, \u201cFollow that cab!\u201d in the movies and he, having had a long tenure as a cabbie had never heard that phrase, he must indeed have been the cab that all other cabs were following (pp. 249-250). I rolled my eyes with empathy when Dirk discovered a freezer cabinet full of \u201cold, white, clenched things that he was now too frightened to try to identify.\u201d (p. 226) I chuckled at the description of Gently\u2019s office that was \u201cold and dilapidated and remained standing more out of habit rather than from any inherent structural integrity\u201d (p. 238) I really loved the slam on typical airline personnel speak (Airline Syllable Stress Syndrome\u2014p. 253). I was sad that the book wasn\u2019t complete, even in its current form."], ["What a delight to revisit the mind of Douglas Adams. I like that this is a collection of emails, speeches, one-liners, and rants. Yes, there's the start of a novel in there, that he may or may not have intended to call the Salmon of Doubt. The result is so much better than it sounds like it's going to be: Douglas Adams died, but his buddy knew his password and emptied his Mac onto a CD, the various unfinished writings were lightly edited and printed as this. But gosh, am I ever glad that they did, because there's some exceptional writing in here, hilARious, as he always was, and glitteringly insightful. His projections on the future of technology, from the 90's, are pretty brilliant, and the piece de resistance is the speech to Cambridge on the purpose of God."], ["A collection of essays, speeches, ramblings unearthed on his hard drive(s), one short story culled from a BBC annual, and the titular unfinished Dirk Gently novel. The essays are breezy and witty, often lacking focus when discussing science and technology, but comprise (realistically) the most readable of his non-fiction output. There are some readers, yours included, who feel Adams spent himself on the Hitchhiker\u2019s books: although the Dirk Gentlys were absurdist romps sutured with awesome logic, they didn\u2019t hang together as novels. The short excerpt from The Salmon of Doubt, however, might prove me wrong: the usual warmth and humour is present, although in nascent form, (the narration even slips from third into first person, a sign of Adams\u2019s dissatisfaction). But all in all, nobody who loves Adams could resist reading this book, despite snoozing through the travel/nature pieces to get to the stuff they want. It\u2019s a pleasing gallimaufry. Savour it, because there is no more."], ["A kind of poor book which just happens to be filled with awesome. I'd really like a well-organized and indexed collection of all of Douglas Adams' short writings. Round up all the columns and editorials he wrote, the text he did for his websites, everything, and get it all tied up with a bow and some context. Salmon isn't that collection; the writings are just tossed into poorly-defined buckets with no real TOC to speak of (and let us not speak of indexes), and there's no real way to tell what's missing or what's even important. There's some occasional interesting serendipity to be had, but eh.On the other hand, it's Douglas Adams, bringer of joy and wry, good-natured English despair, and even inferior collections of his work are crucial."], ["If you love Douglas Adams this book is an absolute must read.

I didn't), and, well I can't think of another one right now, but we're like peas in a pod. Trust me.Plus he recommends some great authors and tells some hysterical true stories. Damn it, I miss him.

This reminds me so much of Hobbes and his Materialist interpretation of the Bible. Also, Hugh going out to the no-weight zone, learning the truth, descending back to his fellows, informing them with the truth, they're blinded: Heresy! Prosecute him!

Oh good old hippies.-----By His Bootstraps: Time Travel, Philosophy.I think I watched enough TT movies to know all the twists, all three persons in the room where the same person (the protagonist), the bearded man with the TT machine was also the protagonist. Closed loops of Cause and Effect common in TT stories. The protagonist writing a failed Physic paper but then magically finding a schematics for a TT machine that leads him to make and travel to the future only later when he get older he sends back the same schematics to his younger self (this wasn't exactly what happened here but you see the similarities).Tho I founded it very clich\u00e9 and fought to finish it in 2015, I'm sure it was quite avant garde when he wrote at the time. The last 20 pages I was planing to skip but eventually didn't, were so enchanting and saved the day!Also there is the usual \"f#%k you scientists with all your entropies and cause and effect nonsense!\" talk common in other stories of the author.-----Lost Legacy: Superpowers.This reminds me of the movie Lucy, \"release the hidden powers within your brain!\". I like how he connected it with lumps of the brain that we don't know the use of, medically. Choosing main characters of a sergeant, a psychologist, a lady, got the story going. The doctor stands for skeptic-in-metaphysics scientist, the psychologist is one that believes in the subconscious powers etc, the girl, well he always put a girl that the other main characters romanticize (check \"Let there me light\").I like how Religion is involved here! The characters, explicitly for no reason (destiny?), climbed up a mountain only to get caught in a storm then some guy rescue them. They discover a community with superpowers up there (x-men school?). Jesus, Buddha, all climbed up mountains. Men had these powers before The Deluge but shortly before the event some grouped started a war and Atlantis sank (The Deluge) and Humanity forgot the superpowers but for small groups live hidden.. Jesus had superpowers!-----Goldfish Bowl: Aliens? Mythical elements (Water/fish, Mud/man, Air/super-intelligence, Fire?/under-the-crust-creatures)It start hard to read and hideous narration then it gets better, when he wakes up in nowhere and naked.\"He awoke refreshed, but quite hungry and extremely thirsty. The matter of dead, mor not-dead, no longer concerned him; he was interested in neither theology nor metaphysics. He was hungry.\"He got all poetic, he was trapped by a superior race (Martians, it was obvious from the beginning like many other twists in other stories) and helpless, just like when he trapped his goldfish in the bowl, hence Goldfish Bowl. (It reminds me of Attack on Titans where titans suddenly attacked people and ate them, just like when people attacked sheep and cows!)Aaaaand there is the usual (skeptic scientist: nonsense! This weird bizarre phenomenon can be easily explained by hypothesis!).. Really? O dear Robert, really? Even scientists need luv ya know..-----Pied Piper: PacifistI like how the author have two general themes, Metaphysical Philosophy (Absolute Idealism?) and Politics (Pacifist, Juvenile), such a hippie lol.\"Men are willing to be killed in war for one reason only -that their tribe may live after them. That is to say, they fight for their children. To a nation without children, war is meaningless, not worth fighting.

No SF or any stuff, just that America was bombed, the government fell, a group is fighting to get their freedom back unlike some americans. This reminds me of France during WW2 with guerrillas up on the mountains against the Vichy.-----Jerry Was a Man: Genetically-Modified AnimalsSF where horses can be modified to fly and elephants read and write. It's human; animals too have feelings!-----Water is fro Washing: Natural DisasterI like how epic this is. It's unique, no Politics, no SF, Metaphysics. But the disaster was expected; the bartender expected it explicitly. This is common with the author; he ain't that good in planting seeds or delivering twists and punches but he sure have a brilliant Imagination!-----Nothing Ever Happens on the Moon: Moon exploration.I like how this collection is ordered chronologically (of writing not publishing) so it shows how the author style of writing is changing by time. This one is way more realistic than earlier writings, no Politics and no Metaphysics. And truly, nothing ever happens in the moon.-----Gulf: Thriller, Action, super weapon, supermen (very intelligent ones).So Superman is going to save man from himself? I smell the usual hippie pacifist politics of the author hehe. One of the characters destroyed the dangerous film and saved humanity.And this mysterious film of Nova Effect weapon reminds me of the mysterious box in the movie Kiss Me Deadly.\"The gulf between us and them is narrow, but it is very deep. We cannot close it.\"Oh and there is the usual \"oh you're pretty, let's get married!\" But this time a girl is telling the protagonist not the other way around.548-552 has some good fiction linguistics that I may return to later.The beginning and end is thrilly, the middle part when he het his fellow x-men they taught him how to unleash all of his brain's power not just the 20% just like in Lost Legacy, middle part was lame at least Speedtalk was fun.There were some small details of Alternative History but is was negligible, had nothing to do with the story.And it ended with them marrying but both dying trying to save the world. And how did the evil old woman make the superweapon? It suddenly happened! Okay there was a good seed, when he first met his fellow supermen he told them they must train them to kill her, also there were some news of her moving to the moon to retire, only to find that she moved there so she can blast Earth with the superweapon without dying since she is on the moon! But still, very weak writing..Still, I really like this along with Universe (my favorite so far) and maybe Elsewhen.-----Destination Moon: Trip to the moon, Thriller.This reminds me so much of the movie Apollo 13, keeping in mind that the author wrote this as a screen play from a movie with the same name.It's really nice, nothing special but well written story. There are aliens living on the dark side of the Moon (just like that in Gulf there was mass always behind the Sun that we can't see from Earth thus is was blasted while testing the superweapon), however they had nothing to do with the story.-----The Year of The Jackpot: Statistical Apocalypse.How cool is that! So events happen in cycles (war, love, death, natural disasters, etc) and a statistics mathematician predicted that after few days all the cycles will peak at the same time (year of the jackpot!), Los Angeles was nuked, WW3 happened so fast, 40 major cities blasted in a blink (he mentioned something like this before in another story; the 40 mins War, or something).I like the Cause-Effect talk. He has the we-shouldn't-how-it-happens cuz it just happens, this is similar to Data Mining (Computer Science) where we have very big data that we don't need to do the root-cause analysis required by Statistics, meaning Correlation is good enough!I like the \"3 million free-wills go to the center of New York every morning, 3 million free-wills go back home at the end of day\". Meaning by statistics (big number of individuals not specifically an individual) we act as if we don't really have a free-will.Also there is the regular \"hey gurl you're pretty, let's get married!\".In general I like the narration of this story along with the ideas in it.-----Project Mightmare: yet another ESP story, Thriller, Cold War?It just so happens that people with ESP abilites were gathered in a military base demonestrating that they can set off A-bombs just when Russia threatened USA in the middle of the demonestration that they implanted 42 bombs cross big cities in America. They used ESPers to blackout the bombs and help the police in finding them. The beginning was bad but it gets better, when ESPers got so tired that when one of them fainted, the city he was searching for the the bomb in it exploded!I like that when something strange delivered to the reader (ESP/psychic powers in this story) the author exceeds that and delivers something even strange to the characters in the story \"they can set off bombs, but can they defuse them? No one tried that before!\"The pacifist ending tho:USA President: \"could you set off those Russian bombs while they are still far away?\"She got a far-away look. \"Dorothy and I had better have a quite room somewhere. And I'd like a pot of tea. A large pot.\"-----Sky Lift: SF, Fast Traveling.I like the narration of this story! I felt what the protaginst felt! My mind was filled with scientific questions! Is it really \"the time advantage dropped by inverse squares. 18 days requires 1g, so 9 days took 4g\", really?I like that they are talking about how much accerelation not speed! Of course they shouldn't feel the trip took 9 days when they are at 4g, going so fast means the time you feel is less compared to stationed observers! Check Almost-speed-of-light Twin paradox.And why is it always that the protagonist named Joe?--------\u00a0A Tenderfoot in Space: Life in Venus.I love this! The narration is so good. He's narrating about a dog, I liked this more than Kafka on Shore's cats. I would recommend this story for reading. He is here saying \"respect our long gone scientists even tho they were ignorant at some stuff, if it wasn't for them we wouldn't be here!\", no more \"f%$k scientists\" lol.--------All You Zombies: TT, paradoxes.The transexuallity is discussed as usual. This is very similar to By His Bootstraps, cliche TT wher five characters is the same person.This is not just the grandfather's paradox, here a girl sleeps with a guy then gets pregnant then changs her sex only to get older as a man to seduce an orphan girl (himseld before surgery) so this orphan girl gets pregnant then her baby is stolen, this baby is taken back in time (by a very old him/her) so the baby grows up as an orphan to be seduced by himsif.As usual the name of the story is a quote from it: The Snake That Eats Its Own Tail, Forever and Ever ... I know where I came from - but where did all you zombies come from?-----I know this is his collection of \"not so good\" stories but still some of them are really good.

He was light years ahead of his time (except when it came to smoking; no one could have predicted how drastically we've changed in regards to cigarettes). Surprisingly, I've only read one of the stories in this book before. (Side note: I actually read that one in the original pulp magazine it was published in.) There was only one story that didn't grab me. The rest were sheer brilliance. You'll find a lot of great characters in here, like the guy who figures out a way to make himself invisible just so he can squirt bad drivers with skunk juice. Or the guy who uses math to see the cycles of time so he can predict disasters. And then there's the person in the final story of the book, \"All You Zombies.\" This story is easily the best in the book. I will never forget it as long as I live, and you won't either after you read it. I'd talk about it here, but the whole story is a spoiler. I wouldn't even know how to describe it, anyway. Just read it, all right?"], ["Lesser known short stories by Robert Heinlein. It's been awhile since I read any of his works, so it was nice to once again read one of the SF masters.The stories vary in quality and each reader will probably like different ones. I found ones I enjoyed, plus some I slogged through.All in all, I highly recommend to anyone that enjoys reading some the golden age of SF. For younger readers, however, I remind you that you need to read many of the stories with the time frames in mind; read in the context of the historical time Heinlein was writing them (mostly the 1940s) and extrapolating the future. Those \"futures\" are mostly our history now and things didn't quite work out the way he envisioned. But the stories and the forward thinking are what makes it fun. For instance, I can see \"Project Nightmare\" made into a movie, or an episode of something, with a modern day \"enemy.\""], ["Nice collection of stories, largely consisting of what RAH himself considered to be his second and third tier stories - the stuff he couldnt sell to the highest paying sources, and so he didnt release them under the Robert Heinlein by line, and instead let them be published under alias.The funny thing is, that although some of them are second or third rate, some of them are even better than his more highly acclaimed works. At least, that is how I felt about them. Many of these have been collected in other books - especially if you have read this one:http://www.amazon.com/Past-Through-To...All in all, there is some real gold in here, and some of it you may not find in print outside this edition, making it a must for any RAH fan who wants to read it all."], ["It might surprise some of you, but science fiction writing, historically, hasn\u2019t paid very well. For the majority of the 20th century, science fiction writers, even the true geniuses, had to be prolific to put food on the table. And thank God for that.One example of why I\u2019m happy for the hardships inherent in SF writing comes in the form of OFF THE MAIN SEQUENCE: THE OTHER STORIES OF ROBERT A. HEINLEIN. Edited by Andrew Wheeler, this is a collection put out by the Science Fiction Book Club that pulls together the short stories that weren\u2019t part of Heinlein\u2019s \u201cfuture history\u201d timeline, of which STARSHIP TROOPERS is a piece.More: http://www.bookgasm.com/reviews/sci-f..."], ["A limited edition collection of stories that aren't connected to his Future History universe. I'd read many of them before, thanks to years of used-bookstore scrounging, but still quite enjoyed the compilation. The intros by Greg Bear and Michael Cassut were nicely done and informative. In general, Heinlein's earlier stories leave me feeling upbeat (if a bit inadequate); however, the later stories were much more cautionary (\"The Year of the Jackpot\"), but considering what he was seeing happen around him, it's easy to understand."], ["I may be over-rating Off the Main Sequence, but I really enjoyed these Golden Age stories; if possible I'd have given 4.5.

Heinlein"}, "One Hundred Years of Solitude": {"average_rating": "4.05", "review": [["Revised 28 March 2012Huh? Oh. Oh, man. Wow.I just had the  weirdest dream.There was this little town, right? And everybody had, like, the same two names. And there was this guy who lived under a tree and a lady who ate dirt and some other guy who just made little gold fishes all the time. And sometimes it rained and sometimes it didn\u2019t, and\u2026 and there were fire ants everywhere, and some girl got carried off into the sky by her laundry\u2026Wow. That was messed up.I need some coffee.The was roughly how I felt after reading this book. This is really the only time I\u2019ve ever read a book and thought, \u201cYou know, this book would be awesome if I were stoned.\u201d And I don\u2019t even know if being stoned works on books that way.Gabriel Garcia Marquez (which is such a fun name to say) is one of those Writers You Should Read. You know the type \u2013 they\u2019re the ones that everyone claims to have read, but no one really has. The ones you put in your online dating profile so that people will think you\u2019re smarter than you really are. You get some kind of intellectual bonus points or something, the kind of highbrow cachet that you just don\u2019t get from reading someone like Stephen King or Clive Barker.Marquez was one of the first writers to use \u201cmagical realism,\u201d a style of fantasy wherein the fantastic and the unbelievable are treated as everyday occurrences. While I\u2019m sure it contributed to the modern genre of urban fantasy \u2013 which also mixes the fantastic with the real \u2013 magical realism doesn\u2019t really go out of its way to point out the weirdness and the bizarrity. These things just happen. A girl floats off into the sky, a man lives far longer than he should, and these things are mentioned in passing as though they were perfectly normal.In this case, Colonel Aureliano Buendia has seventeen illegitimate sons, all named Aureliano, by seventeen different women, and they all come to his house on the same day. Remedios the Beauty is a girl so beautiful that men just waste away in front of her, but she doesn\u2019t even notice. The twins Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo may have, in fact, switched identities when they were children, but no one knows for sure \u2013 not even them. In the small town of Macondo, weird things happen all the time, and nobody really notices. Or if they do notice that, for example, the town\u2019s patriarch has been living for the last twenty years tied to a chestnut tree, nobody thinks anything is at all unusual about it.This, of course, is a great example of Dream Logic \u2013 the weird seems normal to a dreamer, and you have no reason to question anything that\u2019s happening around you. Or if you do notice that something is wrong, but no one else seems to be worried about it, then you try to pretend like coming to work dressed only in a pair of spangly stripper briefs and a cowboy hat is perfectly normal.Another element of dreaminess that pervades this book is that there\u2019s really no story here, at least not in the way that we have come to expect. Reading this book is kind of like a really weird game of The Sims - it\u2019s about a family that keeps getting bigger and bigger, and something happens to everybody. So, the narrator moves around from one character to another, giving them their moment for a little while, and then it moves on to someone else, very smoothly and without much fanfare. There\u2019s very little dialogue, so the story can shift very easily, and it often does.Each character has their story to tell, but you\u2019re not allowed to linger for very long on any one of them before Garcia shows you what\u2019s happening to someone else. The result is one long, continuous narrative about this large and ultimately doomed family, wherein the Buendia family itself is the main character, and the actual family members are secondary to that.It was certainly an interesting reading experience, but it took a while to get through. I actually kept falling asleep as I read it, which is unusual for me. But perhaps that\u2019s what Garcia would have wanted to happen. By reading his book, I slipped off into that non-world of dreams and illusions, where the fantastic is commonplace and ice is something your father takes you to discover.------\u201c[Arcadio] imposed obligatory military service for men over eighteen, declared to be public property any animals walking the streets after six in the evening, and made men who were overage wear red armbands. He sequestered Father Nicanor in the parish house under pain of execution and prohibited him from saying mass or ringing the bells unless it was for a Liberal victory. In order that no one would doubt the severity of his aims, he ordered a firing squad organized in the square and had it shoot a scarecrow. At first no one took him seriously.\u201d"], ["I guarantee that 95% of you will hate this book, and at least 70% of you will hate it enough to not finish it, but I loved it. Guess I was just in the mood for it. Here's how it breaks down:AMAZING THINGS: I can literally feel new wrinkles spreading across the surface of my brain when I read this guy. He's so wicked smart that there's no chance he's completely sane. His adjectives and descriptions are 100% PERFECT, and yet entirely nonsensical. After reading three chapters, it starts making sense... and that's when you realize you're probably crazy, too. And you are. We all are.The magical realism style of the book is DELICIOUS. Sure, it's an epic tragedy following a long line of familial insanity, but that doesn't stop the people from eating dirt, coming back from the dead, spreading a plague of contagious insomnia, or enjoying a nice thunderstorm of yellow flowers. It's all presented in such a natural light that you think, \"Of course. Of course he grows aquatic plants in his false teeth. Now why wouldn't he?\"This guy is the epitome of unique. Give me a single sentence, ANY SENTENCE the man has ever written, and I will recognize it. Nobody writes like him. (Also, his sentences average about 1,438 words each, so pretty much it's either him or Faulkner)REASONS WHY MOST OF YOU WILL HATE THIS BOOK: I have to engage every ounce of my mental ability just to understand what the *@ is going on! Most people who read for relaxation and entertainment will want to send Marquez hate mail. Also, there are approximately 20 main characters and about 4 names that they all share. I realize that's probably realistic in Hispanic cultures of the era, but SERIOUSLY, by the time you get to the sixth character named Aureliano, you'll have to draw yourself a diagram. Not even the classic Russians suffer from as much name-confusion as this guy.On an uber-disturbing note, Marquez has once again (as he did in Love in the Time of Cholera) written a grown man having sex with a girl as young as 9... which is pretty much #1 on my list of \"Things That Make You Go EWW!!!\" He makes Lolita look like Polyanna on the virtue chart! (Note to authors: You give ONE of your characters a unique, but disgusting characteristic and it's good writing. Give it to more than one, and we start thinking we're reading your psychological profile, ya creep!)If you feel like pushing your brain to its max, read it. The man did win the Nobel after all, it's amazing. But get ready to work harder to understand something than you ever have before in your life. And may God be with you.FAVORITE QUOTES: (coincidentally also the shortest ones in the book)She had the rare virtue of never existing completely except at the opportune moment.He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians.Children inherit their parents' madness.He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and swum out the windows.He was unable to bear in his soul the crushing weight of so much past.It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.A person doesn't die when he should but when he can."], ["So I know that I'm supposed to like this book because it is a classic and by the same author who wrote Love in the Time of Cholera. Unfortunately, I just think it is unbelievably boring with a jagged plot that seems interminable. Sure, the language is interesting and the first line is the stuff of University English courses. Sometimes I think books get tagged with the \"classic\" label because some academics read them and didn't understand and so they hailed these books as genius. These same academics then make a sport of looking down their noses at readers who don't like these books for the very same reasons. (If this all sounds too specific, yes I had this conversation with a professor of mine).I know that other people love this book and more power to them, I've tried to read it all the way through three different times and never made it past 250 pages before I get so bored keeping up with all the births, deaths, magical events and mythical legends. I'll put it this way, I don't like this book for the same reason that I never took up smoking. If I have to force myself to like it, what's the point. When I start coughing and hacking on the first cigarette, that is my body telling me this isn't good for me and I should quit right there. When I start nodding off on the second page of One Hundred Years of Solitude that is my mind trying to tell me I should find a better way to pass my time."], ["More like A Hundred Years of Torture. I read this partly in a misguided attempt to expand my literary horizons and partly because my uncle was a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Then again, he also used to re-read Ulysses for fun, which just goes to show that you should never take book advice from someone whose IQ is more than 30 points higher than your own.I have patience for a lot of excesses, like verbiage and chocolate, but not for 5000 pages featuring three generations of people with the same names. I finally tore out the family tree at the beginning of the book and used it as a bookmark! To be fair, the book isn\u2019t actually 5000 pages, but also to be fair, the endlessly interwoven stories of bizarre exploits and fantastical phenomena make it seem like it is. The whole time I read it I thought, \u201cThis must be what it\u2019s like to be stoned.\u201d Well, actually most of the time I was just trying to keep the characters straight. The rest of the time I was wondering if I was the victim of odorless paint fumes. However, I think I was simply the victim of Marquez\u2019s brand of magical realism, which I can take in short stories but find a bit much to swallow in a long novel. Again, to be fair, this novel is lauded and loved by many, and I can sort of see why. A shimmering panoramic of a village\u2019s history would appeal to those who enjoy tragicomedy laced heavily with fantasy.

trapped in some kind of superbubble thing and it hit me that, being cartoons, the characters could just be erased and re-drawn outside the bubble. or could just fly away. or tunnel their way out. or teleport. or do whatever, really, they wanted... afterall they were line and color in a world of line and color. now this applies to any work of fiction -- i mean, Cervantes could've just written Don Quixote out of any perilous situation, but it just felt different with a lowest-common-denominator cartoon. it felt that adherence to reality (reality as defined within the world of the cartoon) wasn\u2019t a top priority. this ended my cartoon watching days and i\u2019ve pored over it in the years that followed: was it a severe lack or an overabundence of imagination that made it so that while all my friends were digging saturday morning cartoons i alternated between tormenting my parents and attempting to use logic to disprove the fact that everyone i knew and everyone i ever would know was gonna die?i had a similar experience with One Hundred Years of Solitude. the first chapter is just brilliant: gypsies bring items to Macondo, a village hidden away from mass civilization by miles of swamp and mountains\u2026 these everyday items (magnets, ice, etc.) are interpreted as \u2018magic\u2019 by people who have never seen them and it forces the reader to reconfigure his/her perception of much of what s/he formerly found ordinary. amazing. and then the gypsies bring a magic carpet. a real one. one that works. and there is no distinction b/t magnets and the magic carpet. this, i guess, is magical realism. and i had a Thundercats moment. lemme explain:the magic carpet immediately renders all that preceded it as irrelevant. are ice and magnets the same as magic carpets? what is the relation between magic and science? how can i trust and believe in a character who takes such pains to understand ice and magnets and who, using the most primitive scientific means, works day and night to discover that the earth is round -- but then will just accept that carpets can fly? or that people can instantaneously increase their body weight sevenfold by pure will? or that human blood can twist and turn through streets to find a specific person? fuck the characters, how can i trust the writer if the world is totally undefined? if people can refuse to die (and it\u2019s not explained who or how or why): where are the stakes? if someone can make themselves weigh 1000 pounds, what can\u2019t they do? how can i care about any situation if Garcia Marquez can simply make the persons involved sprout wings and fly away? should the book be read as fairy-tale? as myth? as allegory? no. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be read solely as any of those. and i\u2019d label anyone a fraud who tried to explain away a 500 page book as mere allegory. moreover, i don\u2019t believe Garcia Marquez has as fertile an imagination as Borges or Cervantes or Mutis \u2013- three chaps who, perhaps, could pull something like this off on storytelling power alone; but three chaps who, though they may dabble in this stuff, clearly define the world their characters inhabit. so i\u2019m at page 200. and i\u2019m gonna try and push on. but it\u2019s tough. do i care when someone dies when death isn\u2019t permanent? and do i care about characters who have seen death reversed but don\u2019t freak the fuck out (which is inconsistent with what does make them freak the fuck out) and who also continue to cry when someone dies? yes, there are some gems along the way, but i think had Solitude been structured as a large collection of interconnected short stories (kinda like a magical realism Winesberg, Ohio) it would've worked much better. this is one of the most beloved books of all time and i\u2019m not so arrogant (damn close) to discount the word of all these people (although I do have gothboy, DFJ, and Borges on my side -- a strong argument for or against anything), and not so blind to see the joy this brings to so many people\u2026 i fully understand it's a powerful piece of work. but i really don\u2019t get it. and i aggressively recommend The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll to any and all who find Solitude to be the end all and be all."], ["\"What is your favourite book, mum?\" How many times have my children asked me that, growing up with a mother who spends most of her time reading - to them, alone, for work, for pleasure - or looking for new books in bookstores wherever we happen to be.\"I can't answer that, there are so many books I love, and in different ways!\"\"Just name one that comes to mind!\"And I said, without really knowing why, and without thinking:\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude!\"\"Why?\"\"Because...\"This novel taught me that chaos and order are two sides of the same medal - called family life. It taught me that sadness and love go hand in hand, and that life is easy and complicated at the same time. It taught me that many wishes actually come true, but never in the way we expect, and most often with a catch. It taught me that sun and rain follow each other, even though we might have to wait for four years, eleven months and two days for rain to stop falling sometimes. It taught me that there are as many recipes for love as there are lovers in the world, and that human beings are lazy and energetic, good and bad, young and old, ugly and beautiful, honest and dishonest, happy and sad, all at the same time, - together and lonely.It taught me that we are forever longing for what we do not have, until we get what we long for. Then we start longing for what we lost when our dreams came true.This novel opened up the world of absurdities to me, and dragged me in like no other. In each member of the Buend\u00eda family, I recognise some relation, or myself, or both. Macondo is the world in miniature, and wherever I go, it follows me like a shadow. It is not rich, peaceful, or beautiful. It is just Macondo. No more, no less.My favourite book? I don't know. There are so many.

You're not going to turn its pages like you would the latest John Grisham novel, or The DaVinci Code. You have to read each page, soaking up every word, immersing yourself in the imagery. Mr. Marquez says that he tells the story as his grandmother used to tell stories to him: with a brick face. That's useful to remember while reading, because that is certainly the tone the book takes. If you can get through the first 50 pages, you will enjoy it. But those 50 are a doozy. It's hard to keep track of the characters, at times (mainly because they are all named Jose Arcadio or Aureliano), but a family tree at the beginning of my edition was helpful. The book follows the Buendia family, from the founding of fictional Macondo to a fitting and fulfilling conclusion. The family goes through wars, marriages, many births and deaths, as well as several technological advances and invasions by gypsies and banana companies (trust me, the banana company is important). You begin to realize, as matriarch Ursula does, that as time passes, time does not really pass for this family, but turns in a circle. And as the circle closes on Macondo and the Buendias, you realize that Mr. Marquez has taken you on a remarkable journey in his literature.

Whose freedom, then, does he talk about? The freedom of the southern farmers whose lands were ravaged? By the prisoners of war on both sides, that succumbed to starvation and disease?

Lazarus Long, the man who lives forever, the man with a brain I envy, the man with many women... I cannot stand him. Starship Troopers and the thirty-second bomb I salute; Stranger in a Strange Land I shed an ironically pathetic tear with; and so goes with most of his work, preachiness and all. (That man had Good Ideas.) Let us be armed, let us be participants in alternative lifestyles, let us be free. When it comes down to it, any work of Heinlein is a pamphlet shouting \"Freedom! Independence! Learning!\" over the tinny Coldplay piping in over the air conditioner or the stylized pseudo-science that is CSI. As much as I despise the man, let me hold up Lazarus Long as a paragon of a lost society."], ["This edition of The Notebooks of Lazarus Long is eloquently illustrated with calligraphy to add a luxury to this wealth of good advice.When I first began reading Heinlein, I was a child of no more than eleven. This, like the book it is collected from (Time Enough for Love), and other of his works played major parts in shaping my personal philosophy, mode of thinking, and subsequently myself into who I am today. That said, I hold a strong bias toward most things Heinlein. I love this collection of quotes and hold its advice overall to be sound and oft humorous and entertaining."], ["Nicely done with some illuminations. Lazarus Long is a character from Robert A.

Now the wiki page pretty much sums this book up - its short - mainly because it was made up from articles and comments made in other publications which were attributed to Lazarus Long rather in the same fictitious vein as the Book Of Counted Sorrows by Dean Koontz. So some industrious person has collected them all in to one book - or in this case an e-book since the Bean paperback was unavailable. They are an interesting mix of comments and observations however like all these books of quotes from fictitious characters - you never know how much is really in the style of the character and how much is reflected by the author who is just using the character as a mouth piece for their views, I guess we will never know. So an interesting book - some things to take away and think about and other most certainly to be left to the pages of historical science fiction."], ["You'll find most of this in \"Time Enough for Love\" & other books. Having all that preaching together in one place is just too much. Lazarus is the oldest man alive & while he's entertaining, he's overbearing & full of himself. After \"Time Enough for Love\" he was a major figure in other books & it all got to be too much for me. Too little story, too much 'father figure' preaching.I absolutely love a lot of the sayings attributed to Lazarus Long, though. They're witty & very often true. Stuff like (paraphrase) 'An elephant is a mouse built to government specs.' or 'A committee is the only animal that has 6 or more bellies & no brain.'"], ["Mind you, before you purchase this, you need to know that it is not a novel, but a collection of quotes and such from Lazarus Long, hence the title, although given its length, it should be 'notebook', not 'notebooks'.

The oldest living member of the human race due to his unique genes, Long has been a pioneer on eight planets, survived wars and lynch mobs, and explored most of the galaxy. His adventures have given him a breadth of experience distilled through the irony of an immortal viewpoint. But there is nothing pompous about Long's reflections on the human condition.

People have recommended him on the basis of comparisons to  Douglas Adams, but Adams is, you know, funny. Here\u2019s what seems to pass for humor in a Tom Robbins novel: beets (the very existence of), a woman getting stung in a delicate place by a bee, and lesbians (the very existence of). And here\u2019s the kind of prose you can look forward to:The sky, layered with thin altostratus clouds and smog, appeared to reflect human suffering and failed to awaken in Claude visions of paradise. (Page 13)The sky was a velvety black paw pressing on the white landscape with a feline delicacy, stars flying like sparks from its fur. (Page 36)With the absence of the cloud cover that normally caused the sky over Seattle to resemble cottage cheese that had been dragged nine miles behind a cement truck, the city, for the first time in memory, would have an unobstructed view of one of nature\u2019s most mystical spectacles. (Page 47)When Claude glanced at the sky, he saw that the text of  Les Miserables had been painted over by Salvador Dali. The sun was so round and glossy and black that had it a figure eight on it, well, it would have validated a lot of long-standing philosophical and theological complaints, underlining once and for all just where we earthlings sit on the cosmic pool table. (Page 81)A few flat clouds folded themselves like crepes over fillings of apricot sky. Pompadours of supper-time smoke billowed from chimneys, separating into girlish pigtails as the breeze combed them out, above the slate rooftops. Chestnut blossoms, weary from having been admired all day, wore faint smiles of anticipation. (Page 201)And of course:Above Seattle, the many-buttocked sky continued to grind. (Page 312)And that\u2019s just me culling annoying descriptions of the sky. Imagine 350 dense, unrelenting pages of this crap. I never thought a book about immortality\u2014one of my favorite subjects\u2014could ever inspire in me such a desperate desire for it all to please just end."], ["Before I knew that magical realism was a thing, I loved Tom Robbins. Before I fell hard for postmodernism, I fell for Tom Robbins. Before I had developed a literary taste that I can be proud of, there was the beacon of hope for me that is Tom Robbins.There aren\u2019t many things I loved in high school that I still love now: Listening to the same Dashboard Confessional CD on infinite repeat, running to Livejournal to unselfconsciously document every oh-so-significant spike in my emotional temperature and wearing brightly colored tights under fishnet stockings are all things I\u2019ve let slip into the past but Robbins has seen me through all the milestones and minutia of my teenage and twentysomething years.Jitterbug Perfume was not my first foray into the weirdly wonderful and wonderfully weird worlds that Robbins builds from the gossamer threads of imagination unbound (I'm actually not sure which one popped my Robbins cherry but I do know I first read this one during my last summer of college when I was a live-in nanny -- which was a surprisingly good summer for bibliomania, actually). It is, along with Skinny Legs and All, tied for the honor of being my favorite of his, and both novels are longtime mainstays of my desert-island reading list. So when my craving for Robbins got to be too demanding to be delayed any longer and the heady of perfume of spring was calling too loudly for the only companion novel that successfully captured the power of scent in words, I knew I could rely on this book to deliver everything I needed and more.It is tempting (like, it is taking an inordinate amount of self-control to fight the impulse) to say something about how beets are the beating heart of this novel but that's only because I have a sick, unironic penchant for puns. Really, this is a story that spans 1,000 years (or about as long as I've been staring at the computer screen while waiting for this review to write itself C'MON BOOZE LUBRICATE MY THOUGHT PROCESS NOW) and connects Seattle to New Orleans to Paris to Bohemia of yore with the wafting of a fragrance. There's also a very loyal swarm of bees serving as the halo a modern-day Christ figure would wear and Pan comes and goes to prove that man creates and destroys gods with a fury and jealously no spiritual figurehead would ever dare to act on. And a fallen king who proves that love can last more than a lifetime and winds up behind bars in the process (if that's not a metaphor for modern times, I don't know what is). ...You know, I thought a little liquid creativity would help me here but it is just so damn hard to express how much and why I love this book and how excited I am that, almost eight years later, it is actually even better than I remembered. This is so much more than beautifully playful prose, a caution against taking oneself too seriously lest you forget to stop and smell the beet pollen, more inventively evocative metaphors than a whole hockey team could shake some really long sticks at -- just to mention a few of the things that established my seemingly eternal entrenchment in the Tom Robbins fan club so many years ago. That's not to say that I wasn't thoroughly tickled by those elements this time around but the more subtle aspects of the storytelling were what really got to me during this most recent reading.This book is a little disarming because it addresses so many issues, Big Ticket and otherwise -- life, death, love, immortality and the conflicted yearning for it, what happens on the other side of death, the individual vs. societal norms, the search for perfection, scientific pursuits, religion (and the lack thereof) -- in such a lighthearted, unexpectedly connected way that its moments of seriousness pack a brutal but enlightening punch. A character who triumphs over death for a good millennium is bound to lose more than he gains in his willful longevity, and his moments of introspective contemplation are a little hard to watch unfold, especially as some of the other characters are revealed to be carrying around the kind of sadnesses that compel them to keep moving; I can now appreciate that there is a definite Pynchonian element of contrasting goofiness of the highest order against some truly sobering sorrows to maximize the impact of each emotional extreme.I was a little worried that, like so many things I've outgrown, my love of Robbins's unique storytelling might now be a thing of the past tense. But he so intricately layers and pieces together so much in his books that there is plenty to notice for a first time (like how Jitterbug Perfume really does follow the format of a hero's journey, complete with help of and hindrances from mythical beings, a never-say-die determination to reach the finish line, the occasional occurrence of wine-dark liquids, and even a visit from a cyclops) and even more to rediscover anew."], ["post-read: Ohhhh, I really missed reading Robbins. What fun! This book was both more and less wonderful than I'd remembered. More because I'd forgotten just what a superb stylist Robbins is (see mid-read comments). His plots are intricate, his characters are rendered in wonderful detail, down to the distinctive vocal stylings. His ideas, though perhaps a smidge stale twenty-five years on, are still interesting and fun and clever and smart, intellectual, but not in a showy or pedantic way. Plus there's that anxiety you get when you're, oh, twenty or so pages from the end of a book, thinking There's no way he can pull it all together satisfactorily in so few pages! But he does! It's a tiny bit cheesy, maybe just a wee bit pat, but c'mon. He had an awful lot of balls in the air. Less for a few reasons. I'd kindly blocked out the fact that everyone in a Tom Robbins novel sooner or later launches into a discourse that sounds exactly like Tom Robbins, which can get pretty annoying. Also, I forgot how letchy he can be. There's a lot of sex in this book \u2013 in fact, it's one of the four pillars of immortality \u2013 which is fine; it's just that the descriptions of it are often a bit much. (\"Alma hiccupped the mushroom scent of his spurt,\" ex, not to mention lots of glistening, semen-encrusted thighs, and that sort of thing.) The other thing, which isn't really bad or good, exactly, is that I think Tom Robbins is kind of a victim of himself. He's too much Tom Robbins sometimes. Too hippie-clich\u00e9; too cerebral-in-an-understandable-but-trippy-way; too specific with his characters, to the point where they become caricatures that are hard to take seriously; even, sadly, too over-the-top with his metaphors (\"his knuckle began rapping at his eye patch like a mongoloid woodpecker drilling for worms in a poker chip\"? Are you kidding?); just too... too much. I guess taking a few years off between Robbinses allows one to forget these drawbacks just enough to come back to him fresh and be able to enjoy his shimmering originality again. mid-read: It's not that I'd forgotten, exactly, but no one does metaphors like Tom Robbins.

This book grabbed all my sense at the spin of the very first few words into the very first paragraphs:\nTHE BEET IS THE MOST INTENSE of vegetables. The radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity. Beets are deadly serious.Slavic peoples get their physical characteristics from potatoes, their smoldering inquietude from radishes, their seriousness from beets. The beet is the melancholy vegetable, the one most willing to suffer. You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip . . .\nThe epigraph introduced the themes of the story:The history of civilization is the story of man's emancipation from a lot that was harsh, brutish, and short. Every step of that upward climb to a sophisticated way of life has been paralleled by a corresponding advance in the art of perfumery. \u2014ERIC MAPLEANDThe distinctive human problem from time immemorial has been the need to spiritualize human life, to lift it onto a special immortal plane, beyond the cycles of life and death that characterize all other organisms. \u2014ERNEST BECKERAlobar would survive a thousand years and recount his adventures to the modern seekers of magical perfumes, botany and longetivity.\nAlobar, however, since, thanks to the Bandaloop, he had witnessed three hundred and eighty-five thousand, eight hundred and six sunrises in his life, and judging from the milky molluscan glow seeping through the barred window, was about to witness yet another.\nHowever, the moment he was devoid of the opportunity to exercise his own believes, the genes came calling:\nMore awake, actually, for the guards dozed over their detective magazines, dreamily musing about the long Thanksgiving weekend that was approaching, while Alobar was kept fully conscious by the smell of his body aging. Yes, he could smell it. During the first year of his sentence, he hadn't aged a notch. His body was still running on the impetus of a millennium of immortalist practices.With the exception of breathing techniques, he was unable to continue those practices in prison, however, and one day it dawned on his cellular bankers that the immunity accounts were overdrawn and there hadn't been a deposit in fifteen months. The DNA demanded an audit. It was learned that Alobar's figures were juggled. He had successfully embezzled more than nine hundred years.Outraged, the DNA must have petitioned for compensation, because within a week, Alobar's salt-and-pepper hair had turned into a pillar of sodium. Wrinkle troops hit the beaches under his eyes, dug trenches, and immediately radioed for reinforcements. Someone was mixing cement in his joints. Now, in his third year behind bars, he could smell, taste, and hear the accelerated aging going on inside him. It smelled like mothballs. It tasted like stale chip dip. It sounded like Lawrence Welk.\nThe prose was just so picturesque and descriptive that it was hard for me not to add even more quotes from the book\nTHE CARROT SYMBOLIZES financial success; a promised, often illusory reward. A carrot is a wish, a lie, a dream. In that sense, it has something in common with perfume. A beet, however . . . a beet is proletarian, immediate, and, in a thoroughly unglamorous way, morbid. What is the message a beet bears to a perfumer? That his chic, elitist ways are doomed? That he might profit from a more natural, earthy, straightforward approach? This beet, this ember, this miner's bloodshot eye, this apple that an owl has pierced, is it a warning or friendly advice?\nPostmodernism, magic realism, epic moments fill up this lengthy, too often dragging tale, bogged down by philosophical daydreaming and too much carnal moments for my taste, but the humor and the literary rhythms of the prose kept me reading.Alobar's tale spanned several continents and nine centuries. It is the story of perfume, of consciousness, of historical moments, of life and beet! This book was an ambitious undertaking that worked very well. It's not a book for everyone, but certainly leaves much to ponder in its wake. It was a slow read. But a very good one.One of my favorite quotes from the book:  Louisiana in September is like an obscene phone call from nature.I truly loved the experience. And now for more beet in the diet and the Bandaloop dances. I'm all set to meet up with Aljobar in my next life :-)Postscript in the book:ABOUT THE AUTHOR TOM ROBBINS has been called \u201ca vital natural resource\u201d by The Portland Oregonian, \u201cone of the wildest and most entertaining novelists in the world\u201d by the Financial Times of London, and \u201cthe most dangerous writer in the world today\u201d by Fernanda Pivano of Italy's Corriere della Sera. A Southerner by birth, Robbins has lived in and around Seattle since 1962.After reading this book, you will have to agree :-)) A friend recommended the book and curiosity got the better of me of course, but I'm glad I took it on."], ["Told to read this by my boyfriend who declared that I NEEDED to read this book to understand him, I am now disgusted and reconsidering my relationship. Ok, I'm kidding, but I take solace in the fact he read this book in high school.Oddly enough, my best friend also said this is her favorite book.Either I'm surprised to discover I'm a prude, or Robbins wastes way too much of a promising book on misogynistic fantasies of all women as nymphomaniacs who live and breathe to seduce and pleasure their usually significantly older male partners. The only relationship that didn't annoy me was between Priscilla and Ricki, and even that one was sexually focused. I don't mind reading about sex, in fact I rather enjoy it if done tastefully, but I feel that the overwhelming sexual descriptions took away from the substance of Robbins' ideas. I found myself rolling my eyes throughout most of it and was even embarassed when a man in a plane commented on my book choice, noting that another author he reads is \"like Tom Robbins if he had a heart.\" I give it two stars because Robbins is clever (maybe too clever) and funny and I feel that the ending made up for what was lacking earlier in the book. Or maybe I was just glad to be done with it."], ["The most glarin\u2019 failure o\u2019 the intelligentsia in modern times has been its inability to take comedy seriously. The above Wiggs Dannyboy quote sums up the experience of my first Tom Robbins novel. It was a wild, irreverent, intellectually challenging and most of all a \u2018fun\u2019 ride, a \u2018look up Chomolungma\u2019s skirts\u2019, a perennial search for \u2018the perfect taco\u2019, a quest for immortality and the meaning of life that tries to expose the connections between perfume, tantric sex, transcendental meditation, pagan rites and ballroom dancing ... oh! and beets. Of our nine planets, Saturn is the one that looks like fun. Of our trees, the palm is the obvious stand-up comedian. Among fowl, the jester\u2019s cap is worn by the duck. Of our fruits and vegetables, the tomato could play Falstaff, the banana a more slapstick role. As Hamlet \u2013 or Macbeth \u2013 the beet is cast. The beet, or mangel-wurzel, gets the royal treatment in the novel, put on an equal footing with ancient deities and with esoteric fragrances, granted deep philosophical significance and mysterious metahysical powers. Robbins lets his exuberance fly from the very first page in singing a paean to the under-appreciated vegetable. The introduction also serves as a weeding out device for starched-collar or thin-skinned readers who might be easily offended by the satirical attacks on widely accepted atitudes and religions. Speaking for myself, the intro had the opposite effect of drawing me instantly into the story. The beet is the murderer returned to the scene of the crime. The beet is what happens when the cherry finished with the carrot. The beet is the ancient ancestor of the autumn moon, bearded, buried, all but fossilized; the dark green sails of the grounded moon-boat stitched with veins of primordial plasma; the kite string that once connected the moon to the Earth now a muddy whisker drilling desperately for rubies. The story / plot itself turned out to be almost irrelevant compared to the flow of ideas and the gleeful deconstruction of \u2018serious\u2019 literature. Priscilla the genius waitress is working in a Mexican food restaurant in Seattle and in her spare time she experiments with the ultimate perfume. Her mentor, Madame Devalier, is also working on a new perfume in New Orleans, with the help of an alluring assistant named V\u2019lu and of a supplier named Bingo Pajama. Across the ocean, in the perfume capital of the world, Marcel \u2018Bunny\u2019 LeFever is experimenting himself with the olfactive revolution. Later in the book, the different strands meet again in Seattle at an institute researching longevity under a modern Flower Power guru named Wiggs Dannyboy and a German Nobel laureate named Wolfgang Morgenstern. If you think this was easy to follow, add an Argentinian accordionist, a secret Tibetan sect named the Bandaloop, a Saxon King named Alobar and an Indian low-caste woman named Kudra, mix in Albert Einstein and a scene borrowed from Dante\u2019s Inferno, extend the plot to cover several centuries, include an impromptu history of perfume from the ancient to the modern times and put the cherry on the cake with the foul-smelling god of anarchy, drunkenness and promiscuity \u2013 PAN. Then you might have an idea of the epic scope of Tom Robbins\u2019 novel. According to Priscilla, the genius waitress, an \u2018alobar\u2019 is a unit of measurement that describes the rate at which \u2018Old Spice\u2019 after-shave lotion is absorbed by the lace on crotchless underpants, although at other times she has defined it as the time it takes \u2018Chanel No. 5\u2019 to evaporate from the wing tips of a wild duck flying backward. Of this long list of characters, all of whom are relevant in the economy of the novel, the catalyst or core element is probably Alobar, whose timeline come first and who defines in the most simple words the eternal human dillema : sooner or later we all have to deal with the awareness of death. Alobar refuses to accept Death\u2019s supremacy and inevitablity, setting out to find the secret of immortality: I may be mad, but I prefer the shit of this world to whatever ambrosias the next might offer. and, Alobar, once king, once serf, now individual \u2013 have you heard of individuals? \u2013 free and hungry, at your service. My mission? Well, frankly, I am running away from death. Heading East from his native Bohemia, Alobar learns that freedom of choice equates also with danger and hunger, and meets in Greece with one of the old wise ones - The Great God Pan \u2013 who adds another piece or two to the puzzle of existentialism and free will: Come with me, Alobar, for while we must go forever in despair, let us also go forever in the enjoyment of the world. and, The gods have a great sense of humor, don\u2019t they? If you lack the iron and the fizz to take control of your own life, if you insist on leaving your fate to the gods, then the gods will repay your weakness by having a grin or two at your expense. Should you fail to pilot your own ship, don\u2019t be surprised at what inappropriate port you find yourself docked. Refreshed by the god\u2019s drink and by the lusty dryads hanging around Pan, Alobar continues to head East, reaching the roof of the world where at first he seeks refuge in a Buddhist monastery, only to discover that he very much prefers the material to the spiritual life. A young Indian woman helps him to make the decision, and from this point forward they will be a couple. Here they teach that much of existence amounts only to misery; that misery is caused by desire; therefore, if desire is eliminated, then misery will be eliminated. Now, that is true enough, as far as it goes. There is plenty of misery in the world, all right, but there is ample pleasure, as well. If a person forswears pleasure in order to avoid misery, what has he gained? A life with neither misery nor pleasure is an empty, neutral existence, and, indeed, it is the nothingness of the void that is the lamas\u2019 final objective. To actively seek nothingness is worse than defeat; why, Kudra, it is surrender; craven, chickenhearted, dishonorable surrender. By this point of the journey I have also became aware of a tendency towards preaching on the part of the author, but I enjoy so much his barbed style that he gets a free pass for more of the same: If desire causes suffering, it may be because we do not desire wisely, or that we are inexpert at obtaining what we desire. Instead of hiding our heads in a prayer cloth and building walls against temptation, why not get better at fulfilling desire? Salvation is for the feeble, that\u2019s what I think. I don\u2019t want salvation. I want life, all of life, the miserable as well as the superb. Yay!!! for Alobar and Kudra ! Reader, be prepared for some steamy scenes of enjoying life under the majestic Chomolungma. Robbins continues to fire up his aphorism gun: To eliminate the agitation and disappointment of desire we need but awaken to the fact that we have everything we want and need right now. ... making time for a sideswipe at those serious, gloomy, cynical high-brow authors, comparing them with Timolus, who  judging the music contest between Pan and Apollo, had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the Apollonian lyre, thereby establishing the tradition that critics must laud polish and restraint, attack what is quirky and disobedient, a tradition that endures to this day. I would propose Robbins is deadly serious in his comedy, coming down hard on the side of Pan and decrying the ways first Christianity, and later Pure Reason (Descartes and his disciples, according to Alobar) have taught us that life is pain and suffering. In this plea, Robbins sounds to me like a later day hippie, a more articulate but equally passionate supporter of a life among flowers and unrestriced love. The old god had endured severe setbacks in the past: the disdain of Apollo and his snooty followers, the rise of cities, the hostility of the philosophers \u2013 from Aristotle to Descartes \u2013 with their smug contentions that man was reasonable and nature defective, and, most damaging of all, the concentrated efforts of the Christian church to discredit his authority by identifying his as Satan. The arrogant attacks, the dirty tricks, the indifference had rendered him weak and invisible, and might have destroyed him altogether had not an unreasonable affection for him persisted in isolated places: hidden valleys and distant mountain huts; and in the hearts of heretics, lusty women, madmen, and poets. The same theme of the fight between Pan and Apollo is picked up later by Priscilla and Wiggs Dannyboy in Seattle, as they discuss Flower Power and French existentialism:-\t Seems to me that the so-called happy people are the ones who are trivial. Avoiding reality and never thinking about anything important.-\tReality is subjective, and there\u2019s an unenlightened tendency in this culture to regard something as \u2018important\u2019 only if \u2018tis sober and severe. Sure and still you\u2019re right about your Cheerful Dumb, only they\u2019re not so much happy as lobotomized. But your Gloomy Smart are just as ridiculous. When you\u2019re unhappy, you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself. And you get to take yourself oh so very seriously. Your truly happy people, which is to say, your people who truly like themselves, they don\u2019t think about themselves very much. Your unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up, because that means he has to stop dwellin\u2019 on himself and start paying attention to the universe. Unhappiness is the ultimate form of self-indulgence. Practising what they preach, Priscilla and Wiggs follow in the footsteps of Alobar and Kudra, learning to find happiness in self-expression and getting in touch with their animal side. (view spoiler)[ \u201cThey can have their loaf o\u2019 warm bread, their new-mown hay. Nothin\u2019 beats the smell of a lassie freshly laid.\u201d exclaims Dannyboy in post-coital bliss.  (hide spoiler)]Where does perfume come in, you might ask? Well, it\u2019s complicated! and while it might have something to do with disguising the bad smell of Pan, the disappearance of dinosaurs or reaching directly into our subconscious part of our brains, I believe it is better to let the Parisian specialist, Bunny LeFever, explain.  Perfume, fundamentally, is the sexual attractant of flowers, or, in the case of civet and musk, of animals. Squeezed from the reproductive glands of plants and creatures, perfume is the smell of creation, a sign dramatically delivered to our senses of the Earth\u2019s regenerative powers \u2013 a message of hope and a message of pleasure.  and, I have spoken to you this afternoon of poetry and of sexual magic. Not too many years ago, the names of our perfumes bore testimony to such things. There was a popular scent called Tabu, there was Sorcery, My Sin, Vampire, Voodoo, Evening in Paris, Jungle Gardenia, Bandit, Shocking, Intimate, Love Potion, and l\u2019Heure Bleue - The Blue Hour. Nowadays what do we find? Vanderbilt, Miss Dior, Lauren, and Armani, perfumes named after glorified tailors, names that evoke not the poetic, the erotic, the magic, but economic status, social snobbery, and the egomania of designers. Perfumes that confuse the essence of creation with the essence of money. How much sustenance can the soul receive from a scent entitled Bill Blass? Tim Robbins is preaching to the choir in my case, and he is guilty from time to time of becoming too enamored of his debating skills, ignoring the need for pacing, character development and an actual plot, but I am real glad I discovered him through the pages of this novel, reminiscent to me of the more \u2018serious\u2019 offers of another favorite author: Christopher Moore in \u201cLamb\u201d or \u201cSacre Bleu\u201d. I plan to read more of Robbins\u2019 books, and I hope they will be filled with the same extravaganza of satire and philosophy.Here are the rest of the aphorisms that I salvaged from my mangel-wurzel journey: If a person has an \u201cactive\u201d life, if a person has goals, ideals, a cause to fight for, then that person is distracted, temporarily, from paying a whole lot of attention to the heavy scimitar that hangs by a mouse hair just above his or her head. We, each of us, have a ticket to ride, and if the trip be interesting (if it\u2019s dull, we have only ourselves to blame), then we relish the landscape (how quickly it whizzes by!), interact with our fellow travelers, pay frequent visits to the washrooms and concession stands, and hardly ever hold up the ticket to the light where we can read its plainly stated destination: The Abyss. >><<>><< It\u2019s been a huge adventure, an exploration of possibility, the invention of a game and the play of the game \u2013 and not merely survival. >><<>><< So make your perfume, my friends. Make it well. Breathe properly. Stay curious. And eat your beets. >><<>><< Philosophers have argued for centuries about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but materialists have known all along that it depends on whether they are jitterbugging or dancing cheek to cheek. >><<>><< Theese dance she make zee blood happy, zee bones happy. I don\u2019t know how to explain eet, but theese dance she celebrate that we are not, you know, died already.  (Effecto Partido, the Argentine accordion virtuoso)>><<>><< Live by the heart if you would live forever!"], ["Tom Robbins is, to me, like the band Rush (I know this seems like I'm trying too hard, but honestly, this is the best analogy I can come up with & this is legitmately the first thing that came to mind): You like them ok, and even get a bit excited when they come up on the radio, but when you're grabbing CDs for your car, your copy of \"Moving Pictures\" somehow never quite makes the cut. That's how it is with me and Tom Robbins. Well written? Check. Interesting characters? Check. Unique? Double check. Glad I read the book? Check...But somehow this is all never enough to get me to grab his next book off the shelf. Robbins is one of my wife's favorite authors, and I can see why, but somehow his work just doesn't grab me on a long-term basis. Still though - great book. If you want something a bit unique & haven't read his stuff yet, give this a try.

This is my first Robbins so I don't know what his other novels are like, but we're talking about an exceptionally charismatic writer here. Robbins takes a bunch of ingredients totally unrelated to one another and makes a story that's as unique as it is brilliant. Beets, horny gods, perfumes, ancient and modern history, eternal life, philosophy and sex. Not the cheesy, romantic kind of sex, but the raw, primitive and full of body fluids one. These are the basic ingredients that he uses to make a story both unforgettable and dreamy. History-wise, Robbins has certainly done his homework. It seems like he knows what he talks about when it comes to ancient and medieval times. The icing on the cake was the masterful use of humor to communicate his rather heretic ideas about pretty much everything. And of course his depiction of the afterlife is simply genius. To make a long story short, this is great stuff which I'll definitely be checking out more of."]], "review_count": "380", "description": "<b>Jitterbug Perfume <br /></b>is an epic.<br /><br />Which is to say, it begins in the forests of ancient Bohemia and doesn\u2019t conclude until nine o\u2019clock tonight (Paris time).<br /><br />It is a saga, as well.
