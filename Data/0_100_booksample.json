{"Heirs of General Practice": ["This was EXCELLENT. Extremely engaging, fascinating, and helped to lessen the stigma surrounding family practice physicians. I am not entering the medical field and I found this to be an enjoyable read. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the doctor-patient relationship.", "I come from a family of general practitioners - my mother was a G.P. and my sister followed in her footsteps - and I am a fan of John McPhee's writing, in general. So I expected to like this book more than I actually did. The book follows the standard McPhee schema - in-depth reporting on a very specific topic, in this case doctors who choose to work as general practitioners. McPhee provides vignettes of a dozen or so such doctors, almost all of them working in Maine. McPhee is usually very effective in working from the specific to reach more general insights, and it is clear that he would like to do the same here. That is, by focusing on doctors who have opted out of the mainstream, he would like to illuminate some general truths about the practice of mainstream medicine. However, I think his success in doing so is limited, rarely rising above statement of the obvious. By focusing his microscope only on family practitioners working in Maine, the generalizability of any lessons they might offer is questionable. The needs of communities in Maine cannot be considered particularly representative of the U.S. in general. So the book never really becomes anything more than a series of isolated vignettes of some individual 'maverick' doctors.Which is interesting as far as it goes, but I wish McPhee had been able to do more with the material. By the end I felt that an opportunity had been missed.", "This book was definitely a good read. The writing was a bit gritty at times with back-to-back medical stories surrounding family practice doctors. A good book to gain further perspective into preventative medicine and why we should to care about general practice.", "An excellent portrait of the heart of family medicine. The fine details of the patients and doctors alike in a case report style are written with such compassion I almost thought the author to be a family physician himself. This book should be required reading for all medical students and for anyone who has ever been a patient. Definitely a book I will be recommending to all my friends!", "What can I say about John McPhee that I haven't already said in previous reviews. He can take any subject and make it interesting. It matters not if your particular interest lies elsewhere. All of a sudden the book turns into a page turner, you can't wait to get back to it book and you are sorry when it's finished. Just pick up one of McPhee's books and see for yourself.", "Quick reading book about what the title says: Family Practice as the heir of the GP. Great, very short, stories and vignettes make the point that there is more to medicine than medicine and that time and listening are often more important to caring relationshps over time.", "What an honest and straightforward book about an important form of medicine. I loved this book. It was short, but very meaningful. McPhee gives small glimpses into the lives of doctors who have chosen to practice family medicine. They subscribe to the idea that if a doctor treats your parents, your grandparents and your extended family, they will be more skillful at treating you. This is the story of the Family Medicine Institute in Augusta, Maine. And how it has revolutionized small town medicine. McPhee follows a group of residents of The Dartmouth Family Practice and shows with honesty and berevity, the types of patients these doctors see on a daily basis. I may also be partial, because my grandfather was a major player in the forming of The Family Medicine Institute. If any form of medicine interests you, definitely read this book!", "The book is rather fragmented, as the author spends one paragraph to up to a few pages about a patient's visit to a GP. Thus it had a rather fragmented structure, so trying to read more than a dozen of pages at a time can get a bit tiring after a while. However, because you can read a few paragraphs at a time without losing the plot, I think it is good for being used as an English reader for EFL learners. The stories are straightforward, and there are not too many difficult words except for the medical terms. I am amazed at how well the GPs know their patients given that they have 2000 to 3000 families to care for. I think my class mistresses while I was at secondary school (like the book in the 80s) with a class size under 40, knew so much less about us.", "An incredible book about Family Practice Physicians and their role in American health care, as well as the need for more family practice doctors who can provide the much-needed service of primary care. This service would make emergency medicine much less costly and would decrease the cost of health care in this country exponentially as well as increase the health and well-being of American citizens. But it's not an easy job being a family practice physician.", "I love books about medicine and doctoring (Gawande's Complications and Better, Groopman), even though I sometimes read them with a tinge of regret at what might have been had I decided to suck up 5 years of med school instead of pursuing the joys of a liberal arts education. In Heris of General Practice, Mc Phee delves into the lives of the men and women who go against conventional wisdom and opt for family medicine, instead of the more glamourous specialities such as cardiology."], "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Quandary Phase (BBC Audiobooks)": ["Possibly my favorite phase, slightly more down to Earth than other installments, but I absolutely adore Fenchurch.", "The Quandary Phase has the lowest rating of the whole series, but most scientists have come to the conclusion that this opinion is based on three things:ignorancestupiditynothing else.The only problem with it is that it's shorter than the other phases, but it makes up by containing some of the most memorable passages of the whole series, like God's final message to his creation, written in fire in letters thirty feet high on the far side of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet of Preliumtarn, which orbits the star Zarss, which is located in the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine. And a personal favourite of mine: The lizard leaders\u201cYou mean, it comes from a world of lizards?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, \u201cnothing so simple. Nothing anything like to straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.\u201d\u201cOdd,\u201d said Arthur, \u201cI thought you said it was a democracy.\u201d\u201cI did,\u201d said ford. \u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d said Arthur, hoping he wasn\u2019t sounding ridiculously obtuse, \u201cwhy don\u2019t the people get rid of the lizards?\u201d\u201cIt honestly doesn\u2019t occur to them,\u201d said Ford. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they\u2019ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.\u201d\u201cYou mean they actually vote for the lizards?\u201d\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Ford with a shrug, \u201cof course.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d said Arthur, going for the big one again, \u201cwhy?\u201d\u201cBecause if they didn\u2019t vote for a lizard,\u201d said Ford, \u201cthe wrong lizard might get in.", "I always remembered So Long and Thanks For All the Fish as being the weakest of the trilogy, but I didn't remember it being this weak. I think that a lot of the problem with this adaptation by Dirk Maggs was in reducing the episode count from 6 to 4 which doesn't allow time for the story to breathe. But then, is there really a story anyway? Is there even a central concept or idea to this or is it just an attempt to find something for the Hitchhiker's characters to do, throwing in a Hitchhiker's concept like \"the search for God's final message\" which just doesn't work in nearly as interesting ways as the original search for meaning in the universe did.I'd hesitate to call this a waste of time but it shows a creative lull in Adams writing and it's also a bad, uncommitted adaptation of the material which seeks neither to understand or expand upon it. it's still sporadically funny, of course. The Rain God is very amusing.", "Same as previous 3.", "The Hitchhiker\u2019s radio adaptations continue with the fourth installment in the trilogy, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.This one is funny and amusing, but the weaknesses inherint in the book are on display here\u2014namely too much focus on Arthur. Part of the fun of Hitchhhiker\u2019s is all the zany characters and you get the feeling Adams was tiring of the series at this point as characters such as Ford, Marvin and Trillian only have glorified cameos at best. This radio adapation does slim things down a bit and it does have some absurdly funny moments that work better in audio than they do in print.", "This feels like a romantic comedy shoe-horned into the \"Hitchhicker's\" universe. Adams essentially hit the giant \"reset\" switch on many of the events from the first story here, losing the general lunatic tone and style of the original. Arthur moons and swoons through most of the story, but little else, almost as if Adams was feeling sorry for all the trouble he'd been put through (or, I suspect, he was tired of writing the character.) This Phase of the radio drama is considerably shorter than previous entries, and ends on something of a cliffhanger: the only real drama in this mostly harmless entry.", "In which Arthur returns to Earth finds love. WAIT wasn't Earth destroyed ???And yet here Earth is. Even though Arthur has been gone for years only months have passed.Arthur investigates this confusion and searches for others who experience this.Not as funny as previous audio products but still better than the book. (Thanks For All the Fish)Remind me to feed fish to the next dolphin I meet.", "This is the radio play version of So Long and Thanks for All the Fish. good, except they added in things to make it sound more current, like going on about cell phone ring tones. which is stoopid since some of the plot still hinges on Arthur not having an answering machine, so it's in a definite decade, you know?", "This one must have been written a lot more recently than the first ones. They talk about \"cell phones\" a lot. (Why not \"mobile phones,\" though? I thought British people called them \"mobiles.\")I missed Zaphod.", "\"romantic comedy\" bits were boring, original zany charas having just lil cameos was sad, but this was still more interesting than the book itselfAlso kudos on the updated jokes, such as the one about mobile phones & custom ringtones"], "In a Sunburned Country": ["Lovely little adventure a la Bill Bryson\nNo one knows, incidentally, why Australia's spiders are so extravagantly toxic; capturing small insects and injecting them with enough poison to drop a horse would appear to be the most literal case of overkill. Still, it does mean that everyone gives them lots of space.\nWhat an absolutely stunning  endorsement. As with his other traveling books, Bill Bryson hip hops his way across a country - visiting monuments and interviewing natives. We meet quirky characters and Australian wildlife galore - from the poisonous snakes to the brutal kookaburra  Incidentally, did you know that the kookaburra likes to bash its prey until their bones have been pulverized? Apparently its easier to digest that way...lovely...He also has quite a lot to say about Australians: \nThey spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving to Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.\n To be fair, Bill Bryson does have plenty of good things to say about Australia. As he goes from town to town, he describes delicious sounding dishes and has a way with describing the atmosphere such that you feel like you are really there. About halfway through the book, I did start to get a bit bored (this book became a bit samey-samey with every town he visited). That being said, I did enjoy reading this somewhat unusual trek through Australia.Audiobook CommentsNothing too special - was well-read if a bit bland in tone/inflection.", "I love Bill Bryson. Yep, it's a full-blown, one-sided bromance. Bryson could write a book about the history of the individual rooms within the typical house and I would love it (he did and I did)! So, when I discovered he'd written about his experiences while traveling Australia, I knew I'd found my next good read! In a Sunburned Country takes in the Land Down-Under, from today traveling all the way back to its earliest historical findings. You expect and get a look at modern Australia, its UK-convict days, Sydney and other cities, the bush, the outback, and the plight, trials and importance of the aborigines. All of the above also comes with a healthy dose of Bryson humor. It's self-deprecating, it's consciously delusional for comedy's sake, it's honest and it gives me the chuckles. I appreciate that he puts himself in awkward situations and really enjoy his description of scenes in which he is a participating victim. Australia has countless ways to kill a person, what with all its deadly animals, so there's plenty of opportunity for hair-raising hilarity, especially considering Bryson's the sort of guy who could get himself savaged by a hedgehog. Fun is fun and all, but in the end this book is about the learning, so if you have an interest in learning more about Australia I couldn't recommend another book more highly. The author has a love for learning, as well as the subject at hand, so the reader is treated to a veritable love-fest spewed all over the pages of In a Sunburned Country!", "I developed a taste for Bill Bryson last year when I read his Short History of Nearly Everything, an ambitious attempt to trace the history of life, the universe and everything in just 574 pages. While many of the scientific discoveries outlined in the book were a little beyond me, I thoroughly enjoyed Bryson's descriptions of the larger-than-life personalities behind the discoveries, which really brought the science described to life. So when I found out that he had also written a travelogue of a journey across the country I may soon call home -- Australia -- I simply had to read it.Australia, for those of you who have never been there, is one of the most colourful places on earth. It has a history so bizarre that it makes China's seem normal by comparison. It has insane expanses of the most arid desert imaginable, as well as some of the world's most beautiful beaches, where unfortunately you can't swim due to the prevalence of sharks, crocs, box jellyfish, stingrays and murderous rip currents. It houses beyond a shadow of a doubt the world's most interesting flora and fauna, including twelve-foot earthworms and living fossils. (And you thought kangaroos were exotic. Ha.) And if all that weren't interesting enough, the locals are slightly mad. They eat meat pies floating in pea soup, are crazy about cricket and consider shorts and knee-length socks proper attire for middle-aged bus drivers. In short, it's a unique place and I love it. I look forward to moving there in a few months' time.Bill Bryson also loves Australia, and it shows. While he likes to remind his readers of the country's amazing collection of deathly animals (over and over again) and poke fun at the locals and their weird habits, his affection for the place shines through in every chapter, and it's quite infectious. By describing his own travels and those of early settlers, explorers and naturalists, he provides the reader with an appreciation for how vast and unwelcoming the country is, and how utterly unique. He provides background information on events of which few non-Australians will have heard (such as the fact that a nuclear bomb may have been detonated in the outback without anyone noticing, and that an Australian Prime Minister once vanished, never to be seen again), waxes lyrical on trees and animals so bizarre that you'll want to hop on the first plane to Australia to check them out for yourself (again, kangaroos are only the beginning), explains why you should go and see Ayers Rock even if you've already seen hundreds of photos of it, and intersperses all this useful information with a winning combination of self-deprecating humour, bizarre anecdotes, absurd dialogue and entertaining accounts of encounters with fellow travellers and locals. The resulting book is not only completely recognisable to anyone who has visited Australia, but hugely appealing to anyone who hasn't. I doubt anyone can read this book without wishing to book a flight to Oz immediately afterwards.If I have any complaint about Down Under, it is that there is too little of it. While Bryson's writing is entertaining and informative, his choice of places to visit and describe seems rather random and limited. I wish he had done more travelling, gone further into the interior of the country and left all traces of luxury behind him for a while, so as to emulate the pioneers and explorers whose exploits he relates with such gusto. I also think the book would have benefited from slightly more rigorous editing, as parts of it seem rather hastily written. For all its small flaws, though, Down Under (released in the US as In a Sunburned Country) is a fascinating read which has whetted my appetite for more Bryson travelogues. And for a return to Oz, but that's another story.", "Ok! First of all I'm here to tell you that non-fiction is normally not my bag. I think I got this book because I forgot to send in the \"do not send\" notice in a book club. That said..... I'm soooo happy that I didn't and I \"made\" myself read this. OMG!!! I lost track of how many times I laughed until there were tears running down my cheeks and how many smiles and chuckles it rang out of me! This is a book about Bryson's trips (I believe he combines a few trips to \"Oz\" into this one book) to the really undiscovered island of Australia and his impressions of what he sees and who he meets. There is history, wonderfully funny and horribly gruesome and sad stories, lodging and traveling tips and a long list of places there that I really now want to see. His wit and sarcastic humor is what did it for me. I will look for more of his books and hope that he goes on more journeys to share with his reading audience.", "I love Australia, even though I have never been there. It has amazing wilderness and is the setting of beautiful movies; it exports talented actors, actresses and directors; it has that Great Barrier Reef thingy, which is apparently so wonderful that is is a Natural Wonder of the World; and it is home to the stunning Sydney Opera House. And oh yeah, Aussies gave us UGGs. So we have a lot to thank them for.Bill Bryson also loved Australia, so much so that he spent months touring its cities and the Outback. Bryson employed his usual humor in this travelogue, and numerous sections had me laughing out loud, sometimes embarrassingly so. But he would also wax rhapsodic about how amazing the land was:There was no place in the world like it. There still isn't. Eighty percent of all that lives in Australia, plant and animal, exists nowhere else. More than this, it exists in an abundance that seems incompatible with the harshness of the environment. Australia is the driest, flattest, hottest, most desiccated, infertile, and climatically aggressive of all the inhabited continents. (Only Antarctica is more hostile to life.) This is a place so inert that even the soil is, technically speaking, a fossil. And yet it teems with life in numbers unaccounted. For insects alone, scientists haven't the faintest idea whether the total number of species is 100,000 or more than twice that. As many as a third of those species remain entirely unknown to science. For spiders, the proportion rises to 80 percent ... This is a country that is at once staggeringly empty and yet packed with stuff. Interesting stuff, ancient stuff, stuff not readily explained. Stuff yet to be found. Trust me, this is an interesting place.Bryson gets into his fair share of scrapes during his Australian journey, and at one point he and his traveling companion are in danger of running out of both fuel and water while in the Outback. Luckily, no serious harm was done.Another close encounter was with a bluebottle jellyfish. Bryson and his guide, Deirdre, were boogie boarding at Freshwater Beach near Manly, when Deirdre suddenly grabbed Bryson's arm and stopped him from advancing toward the \"bluey,\" as Deirdre called it. At the time, Bryson didn't know what she meant by \"bluey.\"\"Is it dangerous?\" I asked.Now, before we hear Deirdre's response to me as I stood there, vulnerable and abraded, shivering, nearly naked and half drowned, let me just quote from her subsequent article in the Herald's weekend magazine: While the photographer shoots, Bryson and his boogie board are dragged 40 meters down the beach in a rip. The shore rip runs south to north, unlike the rip further out which runs north to south. Bryson doesn't know this. He didn't read the warning sign on the beach.* Nor does he know about the bluebottle being blown in his direction \u2014 now less than a meter away \u2014 a swollen stinger that could give him 20 minutes of agony and, if he's unlucky, an unsightly allergic reaction to carry on his torso for his life.\"Dangerous? No,\" Deirdre replied now as we stood gawping at the bluebottle. \"But don't brush against it.\"\"Why not?\"\"Might be a bit uncomfortable.\"I looked at her with an expression of interest bordering on admiration. Long bus journeys are uncomfortable. Slatted wooden benches are uncomfortable. Lulls in conversations are uncomfortable. The sting of a Portuguese man-of-war \u2014 even Iowans know this \u2014 is agony. It occurred to me that Australians are so surrounded with danger that they have evolved an entirely new vocabulary to deal with it.*Footnote: The statement is inarguable. However, the author would like the record to show that he did not have his glasses on; he trusted his hosts; he was scanning a large area of ocean for sharks; and he was endeavoring throughout not to excrete a large house brick into his pants.HAHAHA! Bryson is a hoot, you guys. There is so much more great stuff in this book, and I could type out pages of other funny stories, but I shall leave you to discover it for yourself. Like all of his travelogues, he shares interesting historical details about the places he visits, and he's good at making fun of himself and his bumbling ways. I enjoyed this so much and I laughed so hard and so often that this has become one of my favorite Bryson books. If you like audiobooks, I highly recommend listening to Bryson narrate this. It's marvelous. My rating: 4.5 stars rounded up to 5", "Having travelled briefly through parts of Queensland and New South Wales several years ago, I'd been waiting to catch up with Bryson's book ever since. I now wish I'd read it before I travelled or even during the trip itself. It's full interesting information and ideas for places to visit and gave me loads of laughs. A really good read whether you're planning a trip or just looking to enjoy BB's hilariously entertaining anecdotes. I've read a few of his books in the past and I do find him to be an interesting companion, as I've travelled with him. His books on visits to the UK in particular are great fun (even if he pokes fun at some places quite close to my heart). I'm not sure how accurate some of his adventures are - they seem a bit tuned for laughs to me - but that's ok, it's what you pick up a book like this for I think. I'd recommend this book to anyone thinking about a trip to Oz or readers who just enjoy tales of travel and amusing things that can happen when you're in the hands of a natural raconteur.", "Bill Bryson is on a short-list of go-to writers when I need a thoughtful but not too taxing book. His travel works seem to follow the Bryson formula:1. Bryson travels around a country and gets drunk in hotel bars.2. Bryson gets pissed off at rude and stupid people but is usually forgiving and self-depreciating.3. Bryson assiduously researches the locales beforehand and integrates history into his itineraries and narratives.4. Bryson writes with impeccable skill.5. Bryson balances mundane details with broader musings about wherever he's visiting.Bryson makes travel writing look easy but I don't undervalue his talent. He's funny more often than not, like when he describes the joys of tacky roadside attractions and his decision to trespass through a suburban backyard when he thinks a dog is chasing him through a park. He keeps the text moving and harmonizes the personal and cultural with respect but without sanctimony. Bryson maintains a willingness to criticize and even mock a culture when, well, the culture deserves criticism or mockery. Bryson doesn't look or sound like one might expect from a travel writer; he's a fat middle-aged guy who grew up in Iowa, not some tanned and overtly fit mountain climber with flowing locks and a beard styled to look un-styled. He can dispense with all pretense of coolness and write about his travels from a laid-back perspective. 6. In a Sunburned Country outlines four central messages about Australia:1) The country is so huge and varied that comprehending all the disparate elements as representative of one cohesive nation is very difficult.2) The rest of the world kind of forgets about Australia most of the time, except for New Year's Eve or whenever there's reason to show fireworks over the Sydney Opera House.3) You can get killed in many interesting ways there.4) While many white Australians are preternaturally friendly the country still shits on the Aborigines. Bryson faces a curious paradox when addressing Australia. When describing the country's expanse and diversity he runs the risk of repeating himself. He seems to get a little frustrated with the idea that, for example, while he doesn't have the space or time to describe all the nuances of the huge, barren bush country that comprises much of non-coastal Australia he's essentially describing, you know, the bush country over and over again. You can say \u201cwe are way out in the middle of nowhere\u201d but communicating exactly what that means is more difficult than one can expect from even the best travel writer. Bryson does his best by adding key details (e.g. describing how much he hates the ocean and fears jellyfish) and his best is damn good. He also avoids the cliches, never once mentioning vegemite or Men at Work. I liked In a Sunburned Country and I don't want to downplay Bryson's hard work and excellent narratives. His humility is admirable and I think he's underrated possibly because he's so damn uncool. And I'd rather drive around Australia with someone uncool but courteous and appreciative of decent hotel rooms than a guy who wants to mine the trip for hipster stories he can tell at coffee shops back home. Bryson delivers with In a Sunburned Country. The next time my brain is slightly fried I'll work through the next book in his catalog and be happy, I imagine, I did.", ".Contains spoilersA wonderful read! From belly laughs to joy, from horror to disbelief\u2026.. in this book we have a riveting journey though this amazing and oh-so-different continent. Surely there are few authors who could begin to tackle the scope of this giant hunk of land, but Bryson is a master writer, and he tackles Australia superbly well - with enthusiasm, insight and bucket loads of his wonderful self-deprecating humour.These were some of my favourite bits in the book:* His trip to White Cliffs, in opal mining territory, where the temperature gets up to 110F, and people live in cave dwellings in order to keep cool. * His drive in Victoria along the coast, an area famous for shipwrecks.\u201cWith its wild currents and famous fogs, the south Victorian coast was long notorious to mariners. If you took all the water away, you would see 1,200 ships lying broken on the seabed, more than almost anywhere else in the world.\u201d*His discussion of \u2018acclimatization\u2019 (the introduction of non-indigenous animals to Australia). The mad proliferation of rabbits \u2013 halted for a while by the introduction of the horrible illness Myxomatosis, but now numbers are increasing again. Other introductions include camels, donkeys and foxes. (There are now five million wild donkeys in Australia). \u201dThe consequences for native species have been devastating. About 130 mammals are threatened. Sixteen have become extinct \u2013 more than in any other continent. And guess what is the mightiest killer of all? According to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, it is the common cat\u2026.there are twelve million of them out there, inhabiting every niche in the landscape.\u201d Foreign plants have also been introduced. \u201dPrickly pear, a type of pulpy cactus native to America, was introduced in Queensland early in the twentieth century \u2026.by 1925, thirty million acres were overrun with impenetrable groves of prickly pear up to six feet high. It is an almost absurdly dense plant \u2013 an acre of prickly pear weighs 800 tons, as against about fifteen tons for an acre of wheat \u2013 and a nightmare to clear.\u201d*His respect and awe for the Aborigines, who are likely to have come to Australia about 60,000 years ago. Their amazing capacity for survival in difficult environments. His disbelief in the way they were treated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (they were often hunted down and shot, like animals), and his concern for their well-being today.*His description of the wonders of The Great Barrier Reef. I had no idea it was so big \u201dDepending on which sources you consult, the Great Barrier Reef covers 280,000 square kilometres or 344,000 or something in between; stretches 1,200 miles from top to bottom, or 1,600; is bigger than Kansas or Italy or the United Kingdom. Nobody can agree really on where the Barrier Reef begins and ends, though everyone agrees it\u2019s awfully big. Even by the shortest measure, it is equivalent in length to the west coast of the United States\u201d.  Swimming over it was a scary experience. \"At the top of the steps were large bins containing flippers, snorkels and masks. We kitted up and plopped in. I had assumed that we would be in a few feet of water, so I was taken aback \u2013 I am putting this mildly \u2013 to discover that I was perhaps sixty feet above the bottom. I had never been in water this deep before and it was unexpectedly unnerving \u2013 as unnerving as finding myself floating sixty feet in the air above solid ground. This panicky assessment took place over the course of perhaps three seconds, then my mask and snorkel filled with water and I started choking.\u201d*His stories about men obsessed with exploring the horrendously hostile interior of Australia. \"It is almost not possible to exaggerate the punishing nature of Australia\u2019s interior. For nineteenth-century explorers, it wasn\u2019t just the inexpressible heat and constant scarcity of water, but a thousand other miseries. Stinging ants swarmed over them wherever they rested. Natives sometimes attacked with spears. The landscape was full of thorny bushes and merciless spinifex (plants) whose silicate pricks nearly always grew infected from sweat and dirt. Scurvy was a constant plague. Hygiene was impossible. Pack animals grew frequently crazed or lost the will to go on\u2026.\u201d Some of these explorers returned from their adventures in the interior, but many didn\u2019t.*The degree to which he was bowled over and awed by Ayers Rock (now called Uluru, its Aborigine name). He writes very movingly about the experience of seeing it.*His story about Kingsford Smith - an Australian pilot - who he reckons is the greatest aviator ever. Just a year after Charles Lindbergh made his famous flight across the Atlantic, Kingsford Smith became the first man to cross the Pacific \u2013 a far, far tougher challenge than the Atlantic\u2026 Bryson\u2019s description of the trip is grip-the-edge-of-your-seat exciting. ~~~~All in all a wonderful book. I feel I really got a taste of the flavour of Australia. Bravo Bryson! I enjoyed it tons.", "Every year (more or less), I take a trip up to New Brunswick, Canada, on a family vacation. To get there from New York means about 10 hours in the car; and once you\u2019re there, it is an hour and a half round trip to get groceries\u2014not counting time in the store\u2014and this is a trip that must be made about every other day, since the only fridge we have is small, weak, alarmingly old, and runs on propane. The point is, we have to spend a goodly number of hours in the car.Thus, I have gotten into the habit of downloading a few audiobooks for the trip; and this year, Bill Bryson was my man. I\u2019d listened to his recording of A Short History of Nearly Everything before (it is an abridged recording, unfortunately), so I knew that he had a lovely voice. If you haven\u2019t heard him speak, I\u2019d recommend searching him on YouTube; he has a delightful transatlantic accent\u2014owing to his long stay in England, combined with his American roots\u2014and this gives his dorky, awkward persona a sort of extra layer of fragile charm. He sounds like a delicate man, not one for thrills or even serious exertion, but very clever and sharp, rather like someone it would be nice to have a drink with. I hit play on my phone and we began to drive. It was an excellent start to a vacation. Bryson\u2019s prose is bubbling and lively; and it\u2019s endearing to hear the poor author have to pronounce some of his extravagant word choices. Besides his usual writing prowess, I must say that in this book he chose his subject very well. Bryson begins by emphasizing\u2014and he really knows how to emphasize a point\u2014how little Australia is discussed in the media. And I realized, with a bit of an embarrassed shock, that he\u2019s right: I knew only a handful of facts about Australia, some of which I wasn\u2019t even too sure about. For example, I didn\u2019t even know the name of Australia\u2019s capital; and, really, that\u2019s a bit shameful for someone who normally considers himself a relatively cultured person. (It\u2019s Canberra, by the way.)As Bryson does, he begins his bumbling travels, managing to make even simple tasks like finding a hotel or falling asleep in a car seem Homeric. And as usual, Bryson weaves frequent and lengthy digressions into the narrative of his journey, delving into Australia\u2019s economy, history, biology, sports, politics, local legends\u2014you name it, Bryson will likely give you a neat anecdote about it. Perhaps due to his journalistic training, Bryson has a fascination for all things deadly. Just as in A Short History of Nearly Everything, where he includes several ways that humanity might actually be made extinct, so here Bryson lets his taste for the macabre run rampant with Australia\u2019s impressive collection of dangerous critters. Plentiful and poisonous snakes, spiders, and jellyfish; big and hungry sharks and crocodiles; and even some malicious species of plants\u2014it seems that Australia is not a welcoming environment. Australia\u2019s weather is not any better, as Bryson makes clear with his many stories of the explorers who attempted to brave Australia\u2019s hot and empty innards\u2014many of them, as Bryson gleefully points out, woefully and hilariously unprepared.Another journalistic habit of his is his fascination with gaps. He spends page after page hammering home the extent to which Australia is huge, vast, empty, and to a large extent unexplored. With the instinct of a trained reporter, Bryson focuses in wherever there is something unexplained, unknown, unclear, or even just poorly understood. When Bryson is lucky, this leads him to some neglected piece of history, such as the impressive career of aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. But often Bryson runs up against a dead end, such as the disappearance of Australian Prime Minster, Harold Holt, who took a swim while in office, never to be seen again. Considering that this poor fellow likely drowned and was then eaten by some large aquatic animal, this makes Bryson doubly curious, for it involves both death and mystery.Well, I must say that I had a great time with Bryson, and I\u2019m sad our shared trip has come to an end. One of us has to go back to work. I had a few good laughs, and, perhaps more importantly, now I know more about Australia than ever before\u2014which I suppose isn\u2019t saying much, but it\u2019s something. But still I must admit that I\u2019m left with one dreadful unanswered question. I need to know: is it good or bad to drink your own urine when you\u2019re stranded in a hot environment with no water? Bryson mentions somewhere that it\u2019s not a good idea (although many have done it), because urine has a high sodium content; so it\u2019s counterproductive, and will only speed up dehydration. But there are plenty of stories of people successfully drinking their own urine to survive. My suspicion is that, if you\u2019re relatively well-hydrated to begin with so your urine is watery, it wouldn\u2019t be too bad; but if you kept repeating the process, you would get diminishing returns, owing to higher and higher levels of waste products. Can anyone help me answer this question?", "\"That is of course the thing about Australia- that there is such a lot to find in it, but such a lot of it to find it in.\"\u201cIn a Sunburned Country\u201d is a delightful read, and worth your time if for no other reason than that many of us will probably never get to Australia except in books and film and this text gets us there in its own way. Bill Bryson has mixed anecdotal history, modern travel, biological and geographical history of the continent of Australia in an amusing and mostly quick to read style that I found engaging. It was not a labor to pick up this book, and that is no small thing.Mr. Bryson is at times dismissive of people and some places, which I found a little jarring. However, if that is his honest reaction I should be glad for it. I also think his healthy ego comes thru from time to time. Nevertheless, these are rather small quibbles with what is otherwise a really interesting text. The writing is humorous, at times really insightful, and mostly always informative. \u201cIn a Sunburned Country\u201d is worth a read because it will expand your worldview. And you will enjoy it to boot!"], "The Heidi Chronicles: Uncommon Women and Others & Isn't It Romantic": ["This book of three short plays from the 1970s and 1980s is a delightful flashback for me. I will go to my 50th high school class reunion this year. It will be interesting to see how many of us managed to have it all. A random speech from the first play, Uncommon Women and Others: HOLLY: What kind of pleasure? There\u2019s someone on top of you sweating and pushing and you\u2019re lying there pretending this is wonderful. That\u2019s not wonderful. That\u2019s masochistic. Well, this is a feminist play from the 70s! What did you expect?Here is the description of Holly at the front of the play: HOLLY KAPLAN: hair disheveled, yet well cut. She wears expensive clothes that don\u2019t quite match, not because she doesn\u2019t know what matches, but because she doesn\u2019t want to try too hard. That would be too embarrassing. A relier for many years on the adage \u201cIf she lost twenty pounds, she\u2019s be a very pretty girl, and if she worked, she\u2019d do very well,\u201d Holly has devised a strong moral code of warmth for those you love and wit for those you\u2019re scared of. Holly saw the Radio City Easter Show in second grade and planned to convert. Andre Bishop writes in the Foreward: Reading the plays of Wendy Wasserstein is quite different from seeing the plays of Wendy Wasserstein. In the theatre, they are consistently funny; the comedy sparkles. Yet when one sits down to read these three plays, one is surprised, almost overwhelmed, by their seriousness.It seems to me that Wendy\u2019s plays are ideas that happen to be written as comedies. The three heroines, though vastly different, share an essential sadness, but it is a sadness deflected by humor, because these are witty women and they use their wit to devastating effect. The thing is: I think maybe I just should have been born Jewish. That way I could have a heritage without having to be religious. I just love these Jewish characters and I loved the Jewish women in the Grace Paley short stories I just read. I must have lived in NYC in a past life. Or maybe I will in a future life!A random speech from the second play, Isn\u2019t It Romantic: HARRIET: Mother, do you think it\u2019s possible to be married or live with a man, have a good relationship and children that you share equal responsibility for, build a career, and still read novels, play the piano, have women friends, and swim twice a week? In the third play, The Heidi Chronicles, Heidi gives a talk to an alumnae group in 1986: Well, you might be thinking, this is a woman\u2019s meeting, so let\u2019s give her the benefit of the doubt. After teaching at Columbia yesterday, Miss Holland probably attended a low-impact aerobics class with weights, picked up her children from school, took the older one to drawing-with-computers at the Metropolitan, and the younger one to swimming-with-gifted-children. On returning home, she immediately prepared grilled mesquite free-range chicken with balsamic vinegar and sun-dried tomatoes, advised her investment-banker, well-rounded husband on future finances for the City Ballet, put the children to bed, recited the favorite Greek myths and sex-education legends, dashed into the library to call the twenty-two-year-old squash player who is passionately in love with her to say they can only be friends, finished writing ten pages of a new book, took the remains of the mesquite free-range dinner to a church that feeds the homeless, massaged her husband\u2019s feet, and relieved any fears that he \u201cmight\u201d be getting old by \u201cdoing it\u201d in the kitchen, read forty pages of the Inferno in Italian, took a deep breath, and put out the light. So after all this, we forgive Miss Holland for not preparing a speech today. She\u2019s exemplary and exhausted. If you are a baby-boomer or a feminist or an over-achiever or simply know someone who is, you might enjoy this quick-read that will give you something to relate to, to remember and to think about for a while. Those were the days. Five stars. One extra for the nostalgia. Winner: 1989 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.", "Given:1. Rating anthologies of plays is silly and a little impossible. 2. Reading a play is a funny business unto itself. However:1. This collection got me in a soft spot at the right time. 2. I don't know what took me so long. The Fifth Star:1. Is just for Wendy, in general. 2. And for me, a little bit. And for jokes. And for plays with jokes. And for relationships, and for plays with relationships. And for theatrical realism, whatever it is, and how it's here, even if I don't know what it is.", "The best part of a good collection is watching a writer's voice develop over time. Reading Uncommon Women, I thought, \"This is nice, I guess: kind of like a Seinfeld episode: mildly amusing, with very random characters who talk like people really talk, and nothing actually happens.\" By Isn't It Romantic, I was thinking, \"Well, she's good at capturing a particular historical moment and showing how women think and feel, but she's not actually making me feel anything. She's good, but she's no Jane Austen.\" But by the time I finished The Heidi Chronicles, I was up to, \"Well, damn. I may have to revise my thinking on that Jane Austen thing.\"Each of these plays is interesting in its own right, following bright young women of Wasserstein's generation who graduated from the best colleges, filled with feminist ideals about having it all--marriage, kids, and fulfilling careers--only to find themselves in their mid-thirties with little if anything to show for it. Their careers are not as far along as they once dreamed. They struggle with singlehood or with settling for men who secretly want to marry Donna Reed. And despite the professed values of the Feminist Movement, they're beset by the cattiness of other women. Wasserstein's heroines are struggling with the gulf between the ideals of feminism and the realities of life.The Heidi Chronicles is clearly the star of the collection: the characters feel like people, not stock types, their pain pulls at the heart strings, and the gay character, Peter, gives the play further depth by pointing out to Heidi that women are not the only ones struggling to be seen and respected, and dreams aren't the only things dying in New York in the late 1980s. Wasserstein has captured something very powerful here, and, like Jane Austen, I wish she could have lived longer and had the chance to write much, much more.", "THE HEIDI CHRONICLES; UNCOMMON WOMEN AND OTHERS; ISN\u2019T IT ROMANTIC. (Various dates). Wendy Wasserstein. ****/***/***.This is a collection of Wasserstein\u2019s most famous play, The Heidi Chronicles, along with two plays of hers that preceded it. The Heidi Chronicles, first staged in 1988, went on to win the Tony Award for best Play, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1989. It follows Heidi\u2019s life from high school, through college, and on to her life and career choices. It\u2019s full of those one-liners that I always wish I could come up with but can\u2019t. It\u2019s also full of women who have more or less lost their way. In their pursuit of fulfillment, they failed to define the endpoint. Instead, they have taken up causes related to women\u2019s issues and eschewed the ideals of women of earlier generations. This play probably plays better than it reads. There\u2019s just too much patter among the players to keep up with the printed word. All of the subjects popular at the time are included: women\u2019s rights, the role of marriage, the perfect mate, AIDS, career, etc. If I had to describe the style, I\u2019d have to go back to Sardou and/or Wilde. It is a good play, but I think it will become a period piece. Recommended.", "The first time I read The Heidi Chronicles, I thought it read flat and couldn't see it at all. But it's one of those play where the more you become acquainted with, the more you like it. It feels like a real theatre students play. It is definitely the strongest of the bunch, but I much prefer 'Isn't it Romantic?', because I like the characters more. Heidi is such a tough nut. They all have the same themes running through them, but man, she can write dialogue like a boss. She's a less wordy waspy Tom Stoppard. 'Uncommon Women and Others' is just, weird. I don't know why it's even a play. But I'm sure once I get more acquainted with it, I'll like it more. A+ form, A- content.", "A play I read for my survey of theatre class, The Heidi Chronicles wasn't my favorite. I felt that it lacked any plot or much depth in character development. It tried to tell a moving story of how a woman grows up through the 60s-80s trying to find a voice for herself, but I struggled to connect with the character at all. It jumped around a lot and was pretty confusing. It won a Pulitzer Prize, but I am not sure why. Probably because it explored new issues and was controversial. And the movie is even worse with Jamie Lee Curtis. Avoid both if you can.", "This collection of three plays is not only entertaining but beautifully capture a segment of the Baby Boomer population \u2013 namely, the idealistic, professional women who embraced feminism and tried to make sense of what having it all means. All three plays are excellent, and I say this as someone who is generally lukewarm about the Baby Boomers and their tendency towards narcissistic naval-gazing. Ms. Wasserstein walks a fine line in exploring the issues that concerned her and her compatriots while avoiding self-centered ranting. In a way, the three remind me of a less commercial When Harry Met Sally. Recommended.", "I felt a lot of the emotions that Heidi did as I was reading this play.

I hate them that much.The reason I hate Ginny is---well, never mind. I don't want to start another shipping war here, the last one was terrible enough, so let the reason for my hatred be implicit and unsaid. Dobby is freaking annoying, yo.

I love this series so much oh my Rowling.Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas to YouOH MY LORD VOLDEMORT.In this book we get more little hints to events to come in future books (Horcrux stuff, a mention of Voldemort having left a part of himself/his powers in Harry, etc.) WHICH WAS AWESOME. I find that every time I read these books I notice more things, which was definitely true this time around. One thing I did notice, which COULD HAVE SOLVED EVERYTHING:At the beginning of the book when they're leaving for King's Cross, Ginny forgets her diary and has to back for it. SHE NEARLY LEFT IT BEHIND. OH MAN. Overall, this was a great time, but I'm excited to finally get to my favorite books in the series!!!", "\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\"What can I say that hasn't been said before about this series? What words can do this book justice? I've felt at a loss on how to explain my feelings for these books as I've read them. I didn't experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here, but in some ways I think it's just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood. I have kids, so I was constantly wondering how my 5 year old will accept these books when she's a bit older and tried to view the story through her eyes. The holidays are always a busy, stressful time for us. All of our family is a hefty distance to travel to and, on top of that, we're moving into our new place this month. All I could think about was how desperately I wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day, and this was the perfect book to do so with. No matter your age, the magical world of Hogwarts is truly spectacular; the characters are such that they stay with you even after the final page is turned and the writing takes you back to a place you weren't sure existed for us old farts anymore. If you have been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years like I have, I highly encourage you pick these books up and get swept away like I did.

Nothing can ever beat a Harry Potter book. Apart from another Harry Potter book. And in this 7 (and a half) part series, this is my least favourite book. There's just so many things I don't like reading about. Harry and Ron stealing the car and flying it to Hogwarts? Gilderoy Lockhart? Nah, I could happily go without it.But then there's things that are just brilliant. The Valentines dwarf singing Harry a love song! Hermione Granger being a genius through and through! Fawkes! Unwillingly funny Moaning Myrtle!I think one of the reasons this may be the weakest part of the series is, that it resembles Part One so much: Someone tries to hurt Harry during Quidditch, there's a hidden chamber deep underneath Hogwarts and Harry has to face Voldemort in said chamber.Now, you have to understand that there is nothing I love more than Harry Potter, and this book is one of the most brilliant things ever written. I'm a proud Potterhead and Gryffindor and will forever love this world. Always.Find more of my books on Instagram", "Re-read audio 2017 \u2665Okay, I'm going to do a little *spoilery* in this review so those of you that haven't read the book then you might just want to look at the pictures. I have picked a ton of pictures from the book but believe me, there are plenty more beautiful ones in the book. Plus, if your a Harry Potter fan you will be getting the book anyway if you haven't already!So poor Harry is stuck back with the Dursley's on Privet Drive. And even though Harry is a relative, they still treat him like poo because he's magical. Ewwwwww. Harry is depressed because he has be cut off from talking to his friends or getting any kind of correspondence. Even poor Hedwig has been locked in her cage and hasn't been able to fly around. CRUEL! But Harry can't use magic inside the muggle world. Then Harry meets Doby - the little house-elf that is waiting for him in his room. It turns out that Doby has been intercepting his correspondence because he fears for Harry's life and doesn't want him to return to Hogwarts. So Doby causes some problems at the house that get Harry in trouble. I had to add this cute little picture of Doby running off, look at his little butt. lol \u2193Then one night, Ron, George and Fred pull up outside Harry's window in their dads flying car to save Harry. It's pretty funny how they get it all going but that is okay as long as Harry gets away from his evil relatives. Of course, Mrs. Weasley is not pleased when they get back home. The sneaking out part didn't work very well, but she welcomed Harry with open arms and he stayed with them until it was time for them all to go back to school. I love that picture of the Weasley house =) Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantlepiece and it shouted, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like himPoor sweet Harry and I would love to live with the Weasleys' for a bit =) Look at cute, fat little Scabbers \u2193The kids are going to meet Hermione to get some shopping done. But ole Harry takes a wrong turn down the chimney hole and ends up in some creepy shop. He hides and gets to hear some things Malfoy and his father are talking about.Finally Harry makes it out of the store and Hagrid finds him and gets him to the right place with his friends. Then Ron and Harry are blocked from getting on the train soooooo back to stealing the flying car. AND of course they get into trouble when they get to Hogwarts but it wasn't anything too bad. Snape looked as though Christmas had been cancelled. He cleared his throat and said. 'Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree . . . surely acts of this nature . . . 'It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'They are in her house and are therefore her responsibility.' He turned to Professor McGonagall. 'I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample.'There is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor named Gideroy Lockhart. He's a bit off but still . . . Anyway things are not right at Hogwarts. (are they ever?) And Harry and the gang must figure out what's going on. Poor ole Hagrid gets sent off to Azkaban for something he didn't do! Malfoy is a jerk, as if we didn't know that. lol Harry and Ron go out in the woods to meet Aragog the spider that is friends of Hagrid to find out some truth behind some stuff. Comes to find out there is this diary of a person named Tom Riddle. I'm not telling you who this person really is but they are the one causing all kinds of trouble for a lot of people. In the end Harry has to end up fighting a Basilisk to set things right. He has the help of the sorting hat for reasons, Dumbledore's Phoenix and a sword. Oh happy day! There is loads more to the book then the things I have described but you can just read it and if you haven't, why haven't you? Harry Potter rocks and always will. There is another happy ending for sweet Doby! \u2665Harry gives Dobby his stinky sock so this releases Doby. He now has his freedom from the evil Lucius Malfoy! Woot! 'Come, Dobby, I said, Come!'But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. 'Master has given Dobby a sock,' said the elf in wonderment. 'Master gave it to Dobby.''What's that?' spat Mr. Malfoy. 'What did you say?''Dobby has got a sock,' said Dobby in disbelief. 'Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby-Dobby is free.'Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged for Harry. 'You've lost me my servant, boy!'But Dobby shouted, 'You shall not harm Harry Potter!'There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backwards. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumbled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long threatening finger. 'You shall go now,' he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. 'You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.'Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him ad hurried out of sight.This book is wonderful, it always has been and always will, and the graphics in this book make it even better. \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List", "I sat down to \"read a few pages\" of this before bed two nights ago and had to force myself to stop at page 100...then picked it up and flew through the rest the next day.I really enjoyed this one (as did millions of others, obviously) and, with this installment, I am definitely seeing why this is such a beloved series. The magical wizarding world of Harry, his friends, and the folks at Hogwart's is just FUN to read about. I am in LOVE with Fawkes the phoenix and I adore Dumbledore...And now I am so worried something bad is going to happen to one of them over the course of the remaining books. And, yes, I know it's probably made you gasp in shock that - in addition to never having read the books before now - I have also never seen any of the movies...and I truly have no idea what happens throughout the remainder of the series.

For example, Hermione took on too much work, and she gradually started to go crazy (and consequently distanced herself from her friends, became more moody, and then finally just bitch-slapped Malfoy). I also found Oliver Wood to be hilarious in this book for similar reasons: this was his last year at Hogwarts, and he wanted nothing more than to win the Quidditch Cup so he could have some sort of glory at Hogwarts, and he became so consumed by it (as I'm sure lots of people on sports teams do). The way he was so emotionally invested really cracked me up but also felt so real. Side note: CEDRIC IS SO DAMN NICE. when he realized that Harry fell off his broom during the Quidditch game and Hufflepuff won he called for a rematch, which says a lot about him, and it just makes what happens in the next book that much worse.But of course, all of the Marauders stuff made my inner fangirl go nuts because it has to be my favorite Harry Potter storyline.

Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.\nHarry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no \u2026 their last hope was gone.\nI know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how I did it,\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn\u2019t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn\u2019t suck it out of me \u2026 but it kept me sane.\nI think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters", "I'm beginning to wonder if there will ever be a Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher who is just a teacher.", "I have so much more love for this one re-reading it as an adult. Five stars of course.", "It's a rainy Sunday. It's colder than it should be this time of the year, so I'm drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I'm browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven't written a Harry Potter review. Not a single one. So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.\n\n\u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\u201d \n\nI was 16 years old, and I had just started my english classes in order to pass my Proficiency examinations. My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it, so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter. (Little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english). Before I tell you about my experience, I need to make a confession. It was my choice to stay away from J.K. Rowling's books until that moment. I wanted to swim against the current, and I thought that Harry Potter was too \"mainstream\" for my taste. And the foolish little me was proud of this decision. But when my teacher gave me this old, used copy, something inside me cracked. I knew the basics about the story, about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly, evil dude who doesn't have a nose. But page by page, I came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn't want to offers more than that; he opened a portal to a world where I longed to be fervently. I stayed up late at night, with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences, and I cheered for Gryffindor's Quidditch team, I flied with Firebolt and I kept wondering what my patronus would be (according to Pottermore it's a brown mastiff, which is oddly fitting). I casted spells (but never Avada Kedavra, you shouldn't play with this shit) and tasted butterbeer in Hogsmeade, and just like that, my life had changed irrevocably. I was a Potterhead. And I was proud of that. (my mum wasn't though, especially when I asked for a wand).\n\n\u201cHappiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\u201d\n\nThere is a reason why J.K. Rowling is the fairy god-mother to millions of children (and adults) worldwide. Friendship, love, hope, they're present in her books even in the most desperate times, when Evil seems undefeatable, when no escape is visible. She encourages and empowers, shows that everything is possible, that strength and courage can be found within, when you have someone to hold your hand. Harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving, it took him years but he finally found a place to belong, to feel safe and cared. Ron, with his witty lines and his constant presence, Hermione, my personal favorite, with her intelligence and compassion, they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart, and even now, years later, I'm still under their spell. I think I will always be.\n\n\u201cDon't let the muggles get you down.\u201d\n\nI'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter, and secretly hope that Dobby is the one to blame. I still caress with affection the spines of my Harry Potter books (meanwhile I bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half) and laugh at Harry Potter jokes. And I know, and it's imprinted in my soul, that I'll never be a muggle again.", "Still five stars. Love this so much. Can't review. Couldn't even take notes. Watched the movie immediately after finishing. Need next book. Wish I lived in this world. Damn you, Rowling.", "I'm just going to add a few gifs and pictures from my book. Harry Potter books will always be 5 star no matter how many times they are read. (Hermione forever!)I fell in love with S. Black in this book and I never looked back.I'm going to add some pictures from my book, although now, I wish I would have added more but it is what it is. . . maybe later I love these big illustrated coffee table editions of the books. It makes re-reading them an extremely fun experience. I just wish she would put them all out at once. I know, I know... I'm ready for the next though. Happy Reading! Mel \u2665MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List", "Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction.Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys' bedrooms. He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. \"I don't know why I even bother,\" he muttered to himself. \"I could get along fine without any of them. Let the rat do whatever it is it's trying to do. So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly, I'll - hello, what's this?\"He could smell the rat. Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot. The rat did smell like a rat, yes, but there was also something else. Something... human. It was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. Every instinct in him had screamed to run away, but there was that smell. And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog, and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it. First order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy.The Boy wasn't in, but the rat was. Crookshanks circled the bed a few times. This time, maybe, he would be able to get the damn thing. He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed.By luck or skill, he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. \"A-HA!\" he yowled. \"Gotcha!\" He pinned the rat under his sizable paw. \"Where you gonna run to now, ratty?\" he asked, sneering as best he could.The rat writhed in his grip. \"Please,\" it said. \"Just let me go. You don't know what will happen if you eat me, it would be a terrible mistake!\"\"A mistake, eh?\" the cat said. \"We'll see about that. I have a great big doggie friend who's just aching to get his jaws around you....\"He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. And then, against all of Crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. Crookshanks goggled. Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it. The human grabbed at him, but Crookshanks was too fast. He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily. He was pale and thin, and still looked ratty. \"Think, Peter, think,\" he said. \"Gotta get out of here, but...\" He stopped, glanced at the wardrobe, and grimaced. \"You may just have given me my way out, cat,\" he said. And then he bit the ball of his hand.Blood dripped out, leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. \"They'll think it was you,\" he said. \"They'll leave me for dead and I'll be free to rejoin my Lord.\" He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron's bed. \"It's not safe here anymore.\" He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. Perched on the windowsill, he looked over at Crookshanks' hiding place. \"If I were human,\" he said, \"the fall would kill me. But as a rat....\" His body rippled and twisted and shrank, and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.After a minute or two, Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe, his thoughts dark. The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry, and so was the Girl. But more importantly, the Dog was going to be furious. It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. Crookshanks shook his head. This was going to get worse before it would get better..."], "Giving Good Weight": ["I don't think I've read this one before. Five old New Yorker articles from the mid-70s. Great stuff, and really hasn't dated. No surprises there: I'm a serious John McPhee fanboy. You should be, too. Overall, 4.4 stars.1. New York's Greenmarket, a big farmer's market, is the title article, back when farmer's markets were new. McPhee talks to the farmers/vendors, mostly, and works for a couple of them for awhile. The farmers generally like the black people best as customers, finding them less fussy. Then the Spanish, and the wealthy whites are the least popular: fussy and rude. The farmers like getting paid much more than wholesale, and the customers like good produce at reasonable prices. Win-win, and 4 stars. 73 pp.2. New Jersey Public Service had a serious proposal to build a large, floating nuclear power plant 3 miles offshore, in the early 70s. McPhee talked to the engineers, the biologists, and the oceanographers studying the proposal. The utility seemed to be doing a careful and methodical job , and the scientists appreciated the work. The biologists were more dubious about the project, the oceanographers more supportive. No fatal technical issues were found -- the design was tested for a simulated million-year storm (a super-hurricane) and a simultaneous shipwreck of a supertanker on the enclosing breakwater. Citizen opposition had begun, but no permits had been granted when the project was put on indefinite hold in 1978. 5 stars 44 pp.3. McPhee meets one New York's 2 pinball wizards, tries out his favorite Bally machine, then the two wizards meet at the Circus Circus off Times Square. Short, sweet, very entertaining. I was never very good at pinball. McPhee's piece makes me want to play a game or three. 4 stars, 12 pp.4. A canoe trip down Maine's St. John River, in Aroostook County, almost to Canada. McPhee's companions include a Saltonstall, a Cabot from Boston, and a Byrd, a descendant of the polar explorer. At the time, there was an active proposal to build Lake Dickey, a large hydropower pool, but the Maine river remains largely a wilderness waterway today. 3.5+ stars, 47 pp.5. \"Brigade de Cuisine\" is a article about a chef-owner and his wife, the pastry chef, who operated a restaurant in the wilds of upstate NY, and insisted on anonymity for both themselves and their restaurant, which was about to move anyway. \"Otto\", trained in Switzerland, grew up in Spain and worked there again later, where he met \"Anne\", his wife. McPhee spent considerable time with them, much of it in the kitchen, listening and eating -- McPhee says that the 20 0r 30 best meals in his life were at the couple's rural restaurant. There might be more lists of ingredients and dishes here than I really needed to know, but this is also the most entertaining essay in the book. Here's \"Anne\", who's served a Chivas to a customer, who accuses her of serving something cheaper (it was Chivas): \"You get out of here and you *never* come back!\" The woman ran for her car. 4 stars, 60 pp.", "Thinning my book shelves I got sidetracked re-reading a book I read many years ago. I still enjoyed most of it though I've grown a bit less patient with some of the detail. The title essay Giving Good Weight, about an early farmer's market in 1970's NYC is still my favorite. At the time of first reading I worked in at the Pike Place Market here so it resonated deeply with me. My other favorite Brigade to Cuisine was still interesting though my fantasy of having such a restaurant as described has long faded. Too much work!", "Only John McPhee can make everything from cutting wood in the forests of the northeast to green markets in NYC to a floating nuclear reactor into an absorbing read. There's also a memorable description of an extraordinary chef preparing a a fresh octopus for dinner at his restaurant. I'll say no more.", "It was a mixed bag.As with many McPhee's, this was a collection of shorter writings.We've got McPhee working on farms and at farmer's market's around NYC - entertaining; we've got New Jersey thinking about building floating nuclear power stations - quite fascinating; we've got a story about pinball -which, honestly, was what I was most looking forward to, but turned out to be utterly forgettable; we've got, yet another, story about McPhee canoeing (and I already have a thing about canoing), so I was dreading this one, but it was the most enjoyable canoe writing yet; and we end with an obscure restaurant near NYC - it sounds like a French haute cuisine version of Shopsin's - which makes you want to pack up and leave tonight, and eat there for every meal tomorrow - until you realize the book was written in 1975, and there is no restaurant to go to :(Overall, hooray for McPhee - but it isn't one I would start people with, but I'm considering colored flagging some of the stories to loan out.", "Read only \"Brigade de Cuisine\" and the story about pinball (read through half of \"Giving Good Weight\" before giving up), and the 4 stars rating apply only to these 2 essays. McPhee's writing is great, but his essays tend to be a tag draggy. He has this writing technique where he recites a long string of nouns to convey the magnitude of items being discussed, and this technique is repeated to the point of being irritating - especially when I don't really understand the jargon he uses (e.g. the names of french dishes in \"Brigade de Cuisine\"). As much as I liked \"Brigade de Cuisine\", I felt it could be half the length, so that one could reasonably expect to finish it in one sitting. Still, I found it a remarkably effective piece of writing, in that it achieved its goal of documenting the process of creating food of superlative quality and unfathomable complexity, as well as exploring the chef's motivations as an artist and idealist. A thoroughly memorable piece of work.", "3.5 instead of straight 3. Giving Good Weight is diverse enough to give you a sense of McPhee's versatility. However, I'm not sure if I enjoy his writing style. He's direct & informative but often his endings feel abrupt. The titular essay & Brigade de Cuisine feel like they could keep going for another couple of pages but our author has decided to just stop. Also, his detached style can keep someone from really getting into a piece. When he writes about food, there's a lot of dishes I've never heard of, so I struggle to sympathize with his terse reactions to what he's eating. A good introduction to his works, but not an easy one.", "A collection of essays from one of America's most talented essayists. Giving Good Weight was a gorgeous essay on te farmers markets in NYC, the Atlantic Generating Station on the brilliant plan that never came to pass to build a floating nuclear power plant off the coast of NJ (just what that state needs), the Pinball Philosophy on the competitive world of pinball players, The Keel of Lake Dickey on the joys of canoeing and Brigade de Cuisine (the reason why I bought the book) on a talented chef who wants to remain anonymous (alas!).", "I read it in high school for a class and it instantly became one of my favorite books of all time - it introduced to the world of essays. The ones here are great - an open-air market in New York City (where the title comes from); a chef; pinball; a proposed floating nuclear power plant; and the damming of a river in Maine. Lovingly tended to, McPhee takes each subject to heart. I've not read his other books, more for lack of time than anything else. However, having read this one is enough for me to recommend him to readers everywhere.", "Collection of articles written during the late 1970's. Time of environmental movement and oil embargos (then Northeast depended on oil heating). Also when food choice (natural vs. processed) was becoming important. McPhee immerses himself in these articles while giving profiles of interesting, albeit anonymous, people, a great deal of information about truck farming, nuclear power stations, canoeing on a wild river, gourmet cooking, food shopping and pinball. And lists, lots and lots of lists.", "It was the first description of the open air farmers market movement that I had read and now that I spend my life in them and thinking about them, I realize now that McPhee described it so perfectly and with enough detail so that it could STILL be used as an introduction to any market across the US."], "Uncommon Carriers": ["For 35 years I did what I did (fairly enjoying the first 34). John McPhee, in this book, lets me imagine a few other trades: Tony in the cab of an 18-wheeler, carrying hazmat; Tony pushing a thousand feet of (15) barges up the \"tight-assed\" Illinois River; Tony sorting packages in a UPS center, letting UPS pay for my college; Tony in a coal train, wearing a T-shirt that says, \"UNION FISH STRIKE MORE\". On my days off, I'd paddle a canoe one week with my brother on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, just like those Thoreau boys once did, but with likely more beer. Forget that I'd wreck, crash, get my head severed in a quick stop. I'm reading; and I can do anything.No, this did not make me want to take a course on operating an ocean liner, which McPhee did; but I indulged myself in meeting wonderful characters -- better than fictional ones.Like the hazmat driver who turns to McPhee and says, \"Do you know of a writer named Joan Didion?\" (McPhee: I was too shy to say, \"Take the 'of' out.\") He's read McCarthy's The Border Trilogy three times because, like Moby-Dick, \"you learn something new every time.\" He shares an argot (murdercycles, speedo (speeding ticket), lollipop (mile marker)) but also sprinkles in \"paucity\" and speaks of \"circadian rhythms\". McPhee tells us: He said \"shit\" and \"fuck\" probably no more than you do.And I learned stuff.I learned that the French coined the name \"Illinois\" but \"are not responsible for Ill Annoy.\"I learned about the classic sound of locomotives:As the clarinettist Skip Livingston e-mailed the tubist Tom Spain, \"I've been listening carefully. The trains differ--different locomotives have different pitches to their horns. But I did hear one while I was moving snow on Sunday morning, and I was able to get to the piano before I lost the notes. They were A-sharp, E, and F-sharp below middle C, which made it sound like an F-sharp-7 chord (minus the C-sharp). The instruments that would come closest to the sound would probably be trombones.\"I learned this about railroad grades:The steepest mainline railroad grade in the United States is Saluda Hill, coming off the Blue Ridge of North Carolina at five per cent--a thousand vertical feet in four miles. It is not presently used. To get up it, trains were cut into thirds. To get down it, Dick Eisfeller says, \"they were extremely careful, put it that way.\"I learned that San Diego, thinking itself pretty, has few truck stops. \"They have no support structure for trucks. The closest real truck stop east is at a casino sixty miles away. The closest to the north is Los Angeles County; to the south, in Mexico. To the west, nothing, for obvious reasons.\"And I learned the difference between a Jehovah's Witness and the door of a Freightliner: You can close the door on a Jehovah's Witness.", "McPhee rides on different \"carriers.\" Did not enjoy the stories as much as I hoped I would have by such a fine author. One of my favorite episodes: The truckers all stare at him, so he buys a cap with a gold visor, an American flag, and so on. Now he fits right in. Nice science fact worth remembering: Bernoulli's Principle--where the flow is fastest, pressure is lowest--holds airplanes in the sky. He shows how lobsters are shipped around the world. Lobsters are to Christmas dinners in France what turkeys are in America. Shipping live lobsters around the world is just animal cruelty in my view. At a public hearing, Wyoming officials outline how they plan to sterilize coyotes. One rancher says, \"We don't want to fuck the coyotes, we want to get rid of them.\" There is an underlying failure of getting along with nature throughout the book.

He will film for 24 hours straight without sleeping at times.", "\u201cOn the horizon there were no trees. Deer and antelope were everywhere at play, much too young to care what had happened to the range...\"-- John McPhee, Uncommon CarriersMcPhee is one of my favorites. I think his strongest form is the long-essay and I love his collections that are thematic. Uncommon carriers delivered exactly what I wanted with a bunch of surprises. Like always, McPhee is able to mix together great characters, fantastic observations, and a real sense of space and place and tell a story that illuminates some place or time that you have probably driven past without noticing a hundred times before.McPhee has a a geologist's curiosity and patience (and a poet's pen) that allows him to spend an inordinate amount of time with a story to get that one detail that turns a good essay about boats into a fantastic essay about the craft of work, the beauty of place, the magnificence of the ordinary. The magic of McPhee isn't just that he writes new journalism almost better than anyone else on the planet, it is that he does more of it than almost anyone else. Up McPhee's other sleeve is his ability to make you want to follow him on his explorations. He isn't going to chase down your interests (rock stars, movies, money). Instead, McPhee is going to carefully let you follow him down his rabbit holes and help you onto his hobby-horses.I would also be remiss if I didn't include a part of one of my favorite paragraphs. A barge McPhee is on, is flashed by a woman on a pleasure boat on the Missouri river. Here is McPhee's response:She has golden hair. She has the sort of body you go to see in marble. She holds her poise without retreat. In her ample presentation there is a defiance of gravity. There is no angle of repose. She is a siren and these are her songs. She is Henry Moore's \"Oval with Points\".", "Amazon has been urging me to read John McPhee ever since I told them (it?) I own Annals of the Former World. Amazon tends to do that; add a book to your personal library/collection, and it immediately recommends every other book the author has ever written, ever. In this case it was justified, since Annals looks a bit imposing and I was considering checking out McPhee's other books anyway, but don't tell them that. As it turns out, there are some books I shouldn\u2019t bring along when visiting family, and Uncommon Carriers was one of them. My sister saw it lying on the table and laughed at me. It looked like \"those books for first graders about trucks and trains and ships!\" she said. Look at the boat! Look at the train! What sound does a train make? Gooooood!I wanted to turn up my nose, adjust my monacle, and say \"I\u2019ll have you know John McPhee writes for The New Yorker.\" So these are sophisticated first-graders we\u2019re talking about.But the principle is the same: this collection (one of many, but the first I\u2019ve read) is concerned with freight transportation, the trains and boats and trucks my sister mocked. With an eye for size, for the large and ungainly, McPhee crossed the country in an eighteen-wheel chemical tanker, rode a mile-and-a-half long coal train from Kansas to Black Thunder Mine in Wyoming, travelled on a tug boat pushing a thousand feet of barges up the \u201ctight-assed\u201d Illinois River, and visited the UPS Air distribution hub in Louisville, Kentucky. In the French Alps, he attended a ship-handling school for ocean-going vessels, learning to handle scale-model ships on scale-model oceans and seaports in scale-model time. Back in the States, he recreated Henry David Thoreau\u2019s 1839 boating trip up the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, a journey made more complex 160+ years later by ever-larger canal locks. Through each journey, with insightful humor and a keen eye for what the rest of us ignore, McPhee fills the narrative with mini-biographies, ruminations on the history of freight and the logistics of modern transportation, geographical history, and fascinating studies of the miniature yet complex worlds of the transportation industry. This was the only McPhee book my library had on audio, which wasn't bad--the author has a great voice for narrating--although I later checked out the hardcover edition to read \"Five Days on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers\" because one of the discs was scratched. Turns out I wasn\u2019t missing much: \"Five Days\" didn\u2019t hold my interest (perhaps because McPhee wasn\u2019t reading it aloud?), but that essay doesn\u2019t hurt the rest of the collection, and it won\u2019t stop me from checking out the rest of John McPhee\u2019s work.", "On CD, this book consists of eight discs, and at the start of the eighth disc the foul language suddenly took a quantum leap, so I stopped listening. Was the author accurately quoting his sources? No doubt. Are there other ways to tell the story without actually quoting the profanity? Of course. Most authors did so routinely until, oh, the past 20 or 30 years or so. I realize there are those who think writing is somehow better or more honest because the actual, repulsive language is used. I quite disagree. If you use foul language on a Duluth Transit Authority bus, the driver will immediately inform you that you must stop using this language or you will have to leave the bus. I think this is a good rule. It applies to my car. It applies to CDs I listen to on my car. The common use of coarse language in our society has not improved society in any way, it has just made it ... coarse.The first seven discs had some interesting material. They contained the amount of coarse language that I have somehow come to find acceptable, or at least tolerable.", "Divided into six sections based on the mode of \"carrier\" McPhee is traveling with: HAZMAT truck drivers, Ocean-going cargo ships, Mississippi river barges, Canals of the northeast, UPS/FedEx and deliveries, Freight trains.Most scientifically fascinating was the cargo ship piece where McPhee attends training school for the captains and skippers of these massive vessels. On a lake in Switzerland, they train using life-size-yet-scaled models. One trainee is practicing a docking maneuver and parks an impressive 6 inches from the pier. The teacher reminds him that at full scale, he's something like 15 yards away. If the birds on the shore of the lake were at full scale, they would be 6 feet tall.The canal chapter is a total waste- McPhee and a friend follow Thoreau's canoe trip up the Hudson to some spot in Mass. Yawn.My favorite of course was the truck driving chapter. Not only is it charming and interesting, it spoke to a deep longing to be a truck driver myself. In his epilogue, McPhee revisits truckers saying that \"the late-night hum at hundreds of truck stops across America is a quintessential piece of our sonic landscape.\" Indeed.Unfortunately this was a book-on-mp3, and McPhee is no voice actor. I was actually stunned to hear a director listed in the \"credits,\" since I had sort of assumed McPhee just decided to settle in with a cup of tea one afternoon and read his whole book quietly to himself. Recommend to anyone interested in quirky engineering and/or is consumed by a burning desire to drive a big piece of machinery.", "I loved this book. I actually read the sections when they appeared in The New Yorker. I assume few changes were made. McPhee must have the best job in the world getting to ride with an over-the-road trucker across the United States; traveling down the Illinois River on a towboat and linked barges (something I've always really wanted to do down the Mississippi with a friend of mine]; and following freight trains from the cab. Talk about your Walter Mitty! His articles and books are filled with juicy little tidbits of detail that I just love reading about.I love going to locks on the Mississippi and watching the towboats shepherd their charges down the river and through the locks. Another good site to watch is Starved Rock State Park along the Illinois river. Here's my review on the towboat going down the Illinois section of McPhee's book:The Illinois River is third in freight carried, following the Mississippi and the Ohio. It's a relatively straight river except for some \"corkscrew\" bends near Pekin. The barges that navigate the Illinois can be huge. The Billy Joe Boling that McPhee is riding (some people get all the fun) is pushing a toe longer than the new Queen Mary 2, the longest ocean liner ever built. Maneuvering such a \"vessel\" takes skill and sang-froid. At its widest point, this collection of barges and towboat is four times longer than the river's 300 foot width. The Illinois is an autocthonous river (a word I learned from Founding Fish but will probably forget) beginning not far from Chicago.This particular barge string has fifteen barges wired together carrying pig iron, steel and fertilizer. The ones with pig iron appear empty, but the iron is so heavy and the river channel only nine feet deep at its minimum, that the barges can only be loaded to about 10 per cent of capacity. The steel cable holding the barges together is about an inch thick and the deck hands need to constantly monitor the tension of the wire.. The barges and tug at the stern become almost a rigid unit. The pilot has to steer this mass carefully between railroad bridge pilings and other obstructions. The pilot \"is steering the Queen Mary up an undersized river and he is luxuriating in six feet of clearnace.\" Meanwhile at the stern, behind the stern rail of the towboat, only ten feet away, is the riverbank. This assumes no unusual current changes.On the Mississippi, a tow can consists of as many as forty-nine barges and be two hundred and fifty feet wide. When they arrive at the Illinois, the consist needs to be broken up into smaller groups. Just by way of comparison, a fifteen barge tow can carry as much as 870 eighteen wheelers on the highway.All captains have to start as deckhands, and it's not unstressful. One physician who had been asked to study how pilots and captains handled stress, had to leave the boat because he couldn't handle the stress. The river is rarely empty and you can count on being approached by another thousand-foot tow coming at you down the river. Downstream tows always have the right of way. Hold spots, where a tow can be headed into the bank to wait for a downstream tow to pass, are plotted ahead of time and serve like railroad sidings. There is no dispatcher and the captains call traffic themselves announcing their location.A large tow will burn about one gallon each two hundred feet or twenty-four hundred gallons of diesel fuel per day. Measured by fuel consumed per ton-mile, barges are \"two and a half times more efficient than a freight train, nearly nine times more efficient than a truck.\"There aren't too many locks on the Illinois as the river drops only about ninety feet, but watching a tow go through one can provide hours of entertainment. I remember sitting at the lock across from Starved Rock State Park as a long tow broke into two sections to get through the lock.Unfortunately, pleasure boat operators being \"ignorant, ignorant, ignorant,\" accidents happen. Much like train engineers, towboat captains fear boaters who won't get out of the way. It's impossible to steer around a small boat and the prop wash and propeller suction can be lethal to the unwary.and the section on trains: Driving a train would seem simple enough: you push the lever forward and off you go. Not so. Coal trains, of which just one power plant in Georgia requires 3 fully loaded trains per day to keep running, are usually more than one and one-half miles long and weigh 34,000 tons. They are by far the heaviest trains on the rails. The train is so long that the engine in front (these trains must have engines in front and back and often in the middle as well to adjust the strain on the couplers) will often be applying the brakes going down hill while the engines in back are pushing the cars still going up the other side of the rise. They can't go up hills, per se. A slop of even 1.5% makes the engines work hard.Twenty-three thousand coal trains leave the Powder River basin every year; that's thirty-four thousand miles of rolling coal in a never ending stream of coal for power plants. The Powder River basin coal generates less heat, i.e. fewer BTU's than eastern coal, but it has a much lower sulfur content so following stricter environmental regulations eastern mines have been dying while western ones are thriving. That's where the railroads come in.Plant Scherer in Georgia, a large power plant, usually has a one-million-ton pile of coal in reserve. To understand the revived interest in nuclear power, that pile generates the equivalent of one truckload of mined uranium. \"To get a million BTUs, fuel oil costs nine dollars (before recent price increases,) natural gas six dollars, coal one-dollar-eighty-five, and nuclear fifty cents.\"\"Plant Scherer burns the contents of thirteen hundred coal trains per year -- two thousand miles of coal cars, twelve million tons of the bedrock of Wyoming.\" The plant requires twelve thousand acres to store, process and burn the coal. Think about that the next time you turn the lights on.", "I enjoyed three of the chapters especially: one about a miniature replica in Switzerland of ocean shipping to allow captains to practice maneuvers; another about cross-country trucking; and a third about barge shipping on major American rivers. This is all new information to me, and I like the way John McPhee takes his inexpert eyes and mind into the experience and tells the story to an audience of inexperts. He's pretty funny, too.", "There is a growing branch of literature which consists of nonfiction. How is that possible? The Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996 was awarded to Svetlana Alexievich of Belarus for her work, which consists primarily of interviews of people affected by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl or the Soviet War in Afghanistan. As for Americans, we have John McPhee, who has written a series of nonfiction works of high literary quality.I have just finished reading his Uncommon Carriers, which deals, in turn, with long-haul truckers; a place in France where ships\u2019 pilots are trained; boats that tow barges on American rivers; the parcel sorting services of UPS; and mile-and-a-half-long coal trains. In between, there is a delightful essay by the author about retracing the route of Henry David Thoreau and his brother John described in A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers\u2014which I had read when it was first published in the New Yorker.McPhee likes to take what looks like a boring subject that nobody would write about and turn it into a gem. For instance, there is that tetralogy he wrote about American geology beginning with Basin and Range and ending with Assembling California. One would think that McPhee\u2019s books might be a tad boring, but they never are.", "This book is a collection of mini-biographies of people in the transportation industry. The first, last, and by far most compelling tells the story of a long-haul trucker -- a driver that owns his own rig and tank, transporting various goods. There's something deeply satisfying about seeing a real expert at work: someone that not only knows how to do their job well, but truly and deeply knows how to handle any eventuality effortlessly. The truck driver in this book is unquestionably an expert of that variety.Unfortunately, the other stories aren't quite as interesting. A few of them are interesting enough -- although not up to the standard of the first one -- but the rest are sub-par. One is about Thoreau's travels with his brother, that the author replicates -- somewhat. It seems out of place, compared to the rest of the pieces, and it's not even that enjoyable to read. There's another piece on UPS, which should have been a highlight (goodness knows that there is a huge untapped mine of stories there) but was only so-so: some parts of that one are enjoyable to read, but those parts are more about UPS's anonymous subcontracting of, well, almost anything (laptop repair, order fulfillment, etc), and not about transportation.In the end, I really enjoyed this book. I just wish the author would have dropped about half of it, and either expanded the rest or found other high-quality segments to replace it."], "The Birthdays": ["I almost stopped reading this book a few times but kept hoping it would get better. It was a sad group of characters and the fact that their angst and self-absorption came to a boil at their father's seventy-fifth birthday dinner only increased my disgust with them. There wasn't a single character with which I could empathize and it was depressing to read about a family who were so separate from one another.", "I loved this book... the inner-workings of this family and the way the author set up the characters and their backstories was very good. The publisher's description states it \"examines modern-day marriage, pregnancy, and parenthood.\" It's really a book about the relationships between siblings and the siblings with the parents, and how each person in a family gets locked into certain roles. I would recommend this book to fans of Elizabeth Berg (one of my favorite writers).", "Quite sad to start (for the first half actually!) Hoping it has a good lesson in the end?! Nope... not much. I didn't find much closure and I'm certainly not pleased with the book overall... oh well :(", "I really really liked this novel. A weekend in the life of a family on the brink of the new generation, it was sensitive, insightful, fun, traumatic, heartfelt, moving, difficult and above all an enjoyable read. I can picture myself alongside the family on their beach house. Just my kind of book.", "An unfinished book, could never get into the characters. It has a lot of potential, but didn't live up to the possibilities", "I loved this book. I kinda felt like I was reading about my own family. Great character development and the story was fantastic.", "I was really looking forward to reading this book because of the storyline but I was disappointed. The first day was like two thirds of the book. The other two days was rushed. We were in the main characters minds of them trying to sort things out but in the end there is no resolution. I don't think they still know what to do or of what's to come. But I guess you can't expect resolutions in 3 days. And I still don't know why it was called The Birthdays. It was just the father having a birthday.", "A truly gratifying read, one to add to the list of favourite contemporary family sagas. Thoroughly enjoyed its melancholic tone, and without overreaching for comparisons-its Chekhovian setting and direction of event that unfold over the weekend. Glad to have discovered Heidi Pitlor's talented prose, will no doubt look for her other novels!", "Amazon recommended this book to me based on my purchase history. I was glad I read it. Pitlor told the story of the Miller family 13 parents and their three children and a couple spouses, with all three women of the younger generation being expectant mothers 13 who spend a long weekend away together to celebrate the 75th birthday of the father. All three children and the spouses have various issues and challenges in their lives, while the mother is so absorbed in her personal exploits that she overlooks what's really important among her family. It is an interesting family dynamic to explore, and the book was well written, making the reader care about characters that at times didn't seem to have any admirable traits. The best thing in this story is the father 13 a laid back but warm, loving, supportive, gentle man who puts everyone and everything in his life before himself 13 no doubt, a truly noble life to live.", "This book had some definite bright spots - some nice writing and interesting characters, although none of the characters were particularly likeable. It was a fast read, though, despite the somewhat aggravating characters. I probably would've given this a 3 but I was really bothered by how the writer handled the \"miscarriage\" scene. When you're well into your third trimester, you don't just start bleeding and then have a D&C with no attempts to save the baby or even see if the heart is still beating. It was a very WTF kind of scene for me. I was so distracted by that, it was hard to finish the book."], "Shadows in the Starlight (Changeling #2)": ["** spoiler alert **\n           I closed this book and immediately went searching for more. Even though the first book is billed as being the first in a trilogy and even though this book leaves things hanging there is no third book. Cunningham is apparently still writing so here's hoping she finishes this series.This book picks up immediately after the first. The one thing I found odd was that in just a matter of days (though it was two years between publishing the first book and this one) Gwen was all of a sudden comfortable with these new developments in her life and not obviously mourning her friend any longer. It was as if she'd accepted herself being an \"Elder\" (elf) overnight and the readers weren't privy to that acceptance.The plotline in this book was tangled, not badly so, but just enough so that while Gwen was picking up pieces of one case we the reader could see how they related to another. I was left wondering about the changeling process, and the implications that elf children were switched with human children with a plan in place to switch them back when they are teenagers. As Gwen says, that would take a lot of planning, and I wasn't sure if Gwen was wrong about it, if it applied to only one person, or if we were to take it as being the way things are done by the elves. I was (and still am) hoping a third book will clear that up.I'm also waiting for the elves' plans to be made clearer. Right now it seems as if Ian Forest could be on Gwen's side but maybe only when her side runs along side his. He's self-serving, that's obvious, but nowhere near as bad as Edmondson was.", "I enjoyed this book but the ambiguousness of the tale left me wondering who actually did what. There's a lot of finger pointing but nothing definitively stated. The tale is confusing enough without the author leaving it up to the reader's interpretation. I like Ian Forest but there is definitely something shady about his character and what the heck is Jason up to. I also like Gwen but she needs to get her head in the game and figure out what's up with her heritage. All the little hints are fine and dandy but they don't actually go anywhere. I guess we'll never find out now. I'm disappointed to find out that the author (for reasons not her own) has left this series dangling. What a shame as it really did have potential.", "Scattered thoughts: I didn't realize this was a second book and while I normally prefer to jump in cold, I was a bit overwhelmed with the number of characters and story threads going on. There is a sex scene that doesn't fit the tone of the book and really feels like a stopgap measure to make the book fit in more with the Urban Fantasy genre.I think that the main problem with this book, and the reason that I found it in the bin at an \"Odd Lot\" store, is the cover. The cover is wretched. If I had not already read this author, I would never have picked up the book. The cover screams cheap and confused, which is surprising considering that the publisher is Tor.", "This book was great! Everyone was so wickedly deceitful. You never knew who was going to kill who.... and there was a lot of killin' going on. Gwen is a smartass with a \"don't fuck with me\" attitude that I love. There is no romance in this book. Gwen sleeps with a few friends when she feels the need to, but otherwise her love life is non-existent. Normally that would turn me off from a book, but there was so much going on that I didn't mind her lacking a relationship. I am disappointed that Cunningham didn't continue this series.", "Took me a while to actually finish this once I started, probably because I knew that if it ended with a cliffhanger I would probably never get relief, being that the series is suspended indefinitely.The book is cool, due to the fact that it is set in my birthplace and current residence of Providence, RI (woot woot!). I did enjoy the story and progression better with this installment. The true colors of all the players are peeping out. Too bad we might never get a conclusion to the story.I'd say give the book a try.", "A different take on elves. I thought the books (this is the 2nd) were enjoyable and very readable, but apparently the publisher didn't see reason to keep going with the series. The author's website mentions trying to put together some longish short stories to wrap up the loose threads, which would certainly be nice. I think this may have just become the first series I _should_ remove from my spreadsheet (since it is technically finished), but, I'll leave it in for now in the hopes of noticing when those short stories are published (in paper or electronically).", "Second in series about elves in our world, and a woman who finds out she was a changeling (an elf left in place of a human baby).

I hope she will self-publish the 3rd book because I really want to find out how things turn out.", "Much like the first book, I feel like this book is just a continuation of the series and cannot really stand on its own.

GREAT work Smith! you deserved a five star..Thanks.", "Being a huge Lord of the Rings nerd, having written my senior college Capstone on the linguistic merits of Quenya and Sindarin Elvish, I think I'm pretty qualified to rate this book in accuracy. All in all, it made detailed reference to the Silmarillion lineages of Gil-Galad and Elendil of the Numenorean line really well. It mentioned the sundering of many nations existing only in the Silmarillion and known only to the avid LotR \"scholar\".However, much of this was undermined by the fact that there were consistent references to what happened solely in the movies. For example, the author makes reference to Arwen coming to the Hobbits' aid, when she did no such thing in the original source material, and there was no reference of Glorfindel. No reference to Tom Bombadil, either in that regard. Many grammatical errors ensued as well, which annoyed me. It makes the author sound like he hasn't read any of the books, but rather tried to listen to a friend who did all the research. Author cannot correctly differentiate between \"Rohan\" and \"The Rohirrim\", often saying \"The Rohan\", or even things like \"The Barad-dur.\"My favorite part about this book though was that despite having a lack of knowledge of the original book's lore, Smith has an in-depth knowledge of smithing and leather crafting, giving extravagant and well detailed descriptions of what went into the armor described in the books and represented in the films. That alone is why you pick this book up.", "(More pictures at parkablogs.com)This is the movie visual companion that looks specifically at the weapons and history of warfare in The Lord of the Rings.There are lots of photos of the weapons and armor featured in the movie, with occasional concept sketches. The writeup is incredibly detailed. There are lengthy discussions on the major battles, war zones, warriors, and other forms of weapon from Frodo's Sting sword to the scary Grond battling ram or the gigantic elephant-like Mumakil. There's even a range chart on how far different type of arrows can fly.This isn't really a making-of book so you're won't read anything like how uncomfortable the actors felt while in suit. You'll know what type of wood Legolas' bow is made of, but not of the movie prop bow.This is the book for all LOTR fans fascinated with weaponry and warfare."], "I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America after Twenty Years Away": ["Have you ever visited a foreign country for a length of time, to the point where you were caught up in a completely different lifestyle and society, and then when you finally returned home, you experienced a form of reverse culture shock?That is what happened to Bill Bryson when he moved back to the U.S. after living in England for two decades. This delightful book is a collection of weekly columns he wrote for the Mail on Sunday newspaper from 1996 to 1998. Bryson has fun talking about American food, going shopping, holiday seasons, going to the movies, going to the beach, the U.S. postal service, U.S. tax forms, and dozens of awkward and humorous encounters he had with fellow citizens. Even though some of the columns showed their age a bit (such as referencing pre-Internet computers and habits) or they included statistics from the 1990s when Bryson was trying to make a point, the pieces were still largely relevant and got at the heart of what it was like to live in America. Q&AIs this your favorite Bryson book? No, that honor would go to \"A Walk in the Woods,\" with \"At Home\" getting second place.Would you recommend this to fellow readers? Yes, but I would say that I don't think it should be the first Bryson book you read. The short columns are fun, but they're not as cohesive as his travelogues or history books.Is this one of those times when you would recommend listening to the audiobook instead of reading the print? Yes, I would. Bryson is a wonderful narrator and I think I enjoyed the book more because I listened to him tell these shorter stories.Why are you reading so many Bill Bryson books? You're getting a bit obsessive. We're concerned and we're thinking of an intervention.WHOA. Everyone can calm down. I'm not obsessed, I've just been working my way through a collection of his audiobooks. They are a delightful way to pass my daily commute to work. You should try it -- some days a Bryson story makes me laugh so hard that it brings tears to my eyes. It's a great way to start the day. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go listen to his book about visiting Australia.Some favorite quotes:\"Coming back to your native land after an absence of many years is a surprisingly unsettling business, a little like waking from a long coma. Time, you discover, has wrought changes that leave you feeling mildly foolish and out of touch. You proffer hopelessly inadequate sums when making small purchases. You puzzle over ATM machines and automated gas pumps and pay phones, and are astounded to discover, by means of a stern grip on your elbow, that gas station road maps are no longer free.\"\"Some weeks ago I announced to my wife that I was going to the supermarket with her next time she went because the stuff she kept bringing home was -- how can I put this? -- not fully in the spirit of American eating. I mean, here we were living in a paradise of junk food -- the country that gave the world cheese in a spray can -- and she kept bringing home healthy stuff like fresh broccoli and packets of Swedish crispbread. It was because she was English, of course. She didn't really understand the rich, unrivaled possibilities for greasiness and goo that the American diet offers. I longed for artificial bacon bits, melted cheese in a shade of yellow unknown to nature, and creamy chocolate fillings, sometimes all the in same product. I wanted food that squirts when you bite into it or plops onto your shirt front in such gross quantities that you have to rise very, very carefully from the table and sort of limbo over to the sink to clean yourself up.\"\"I'm going to have to be quick because it's a Sunday and the weather is glorious and Mrs. Bryson has outlined a big, ambitious program of gardening. Worse, she's wearing what I nervously call her Nike expression -- the one that says, 'Just do it.' Now don't get me wrong. Mrs. Bryson is a rare and delightful creature and goodness knows my life needs structure and supervision, but when she gets out a pad and pen and writes the words 'Things to Do' (vigorously underscored several times) you know it's going to be a long time till Monday.\" [On why his mother was not a great cook] To be perfectly fair to her, my mother had several strikes against her in the kitchen department. To begin with, she couldn't have been a great cook even if she had wanted to. She had a career, you see -- she worked for the local newspaper, which meant that she was always flying in the door two minutes before it was time to put dinner on the table. On top of this, she was a trifle absentminded. Her particular specialty was to cook things while they were still in the packaging. I was almost full-grown before I realized that Saran Wrap wasn't a sort of chewy glaze. A combination of haste, forgetfulness, and a charming incompetence where household appliances were concerned meant that most of her cooking experiences were punctuated with billows of smoke and occasional small explosions. In our house, as a rule of thumb, you knew it was time to eat when the firemen departed.\"My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4", "1000 BOOKS READ!!! Okay, maybe it's not an exact 1000. Some of the books I've added to my GR read list are not even books. On the other hand, I know I've forgotten some of the books I read as a kid, so maybe it evens out in the end, and GR's count is probably as accurate as it's going to get. Therefore, let the good times roll!Oh my goodness, that was fun. Okay, back to business. I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America after Twenty Years Away is a very long title. It rambles a bit, doesn't it? Unfortunately, so does its author, Bill Bryson. This book loses focus. Sure, these are essays, but even within each essay he gets lost now and then.I am a Bryson fan, but this was not one of my favorites of his. It's a collection from his column in a Brit newspaper. It's mildly interesting for its take on American life viewed through the lens of an American ex-pat returning home after Englishing himself up for a few years. That could be a good premise and most of this is fairly entertaining, but often it devolves into complaining rants. The humor also occasionally falls back on John Cleese's list tactic of comedy creation, where if you don't have a strong premise, you just keep adding to it so that the preponderance of substance eventually feels like quality. You can almost see Bryson flailing around for things to write about. Creating content for a weekly column is no easy task!I prefer when he focuses on a topic and sticks with it for the length of the book. For instance, A Walk in the Woods is about walking the Appalachian Trail. In a Sunburned Country is a humous look at the deadliness of Australia. The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid is a delightful recounting of his childhood in the Midwest. One Summer: America, 1927 is...self-explanatory. All of these are better than I'm a Stranger Here Myself, as far as my tastes go.", "First think I will say is that this isn't the book I would finish if I didn't have to, for university. I'm not saying that this book isn't good, I'm just saying that this book wasn't for me.Second thing I will say is that I can't believe that I finally finished it. I don't think I've ever needed this much time to finish one book (and the book wasn't even that big).I'm a Stranger Here Myself (or as it was released in England: Notes from a Big Country) is a collection of columns. When Bill Bryson moved to the United States he started writing columns for British newspapers, and those columns were later collected and put together into a book. And in these columns all Bryson did was moan, moan and (yeah you've guessed it!) moan. It was fun reading it at the beginning, but after few columns it just got annoying.But one thing I liked about this book (and the reason I didn't give it one star) was the humor. Bryson have sarcastic and dark humor, and in few columns it showed and even made me laugh. If he used his humor more, I might have actually liked the book more.", "As an expat about to return to the US, this book simply wasn't Weird enough for me. It in no way captures my experience of how completely absurd the US feels upon returning after an extended absence. Obsessions with skinny white girls named Jessica; the unbelievable noise, especially from radio and TV; un-ending ads for stuff on sale (which exist in other places, but when it's in another language, I just tune it out); the fact that no one walks anywhere; the enormous bodies(quitting smoking maybe wasn't such a great idea, folks...); the amount of non-food items for sale in a grocery store; the general ignorance and out-right disinterest in news from other places; the list goes on. I like Bryson's humor, but I think I like his earlier work best. (\"Fat Girls from Des Moines\" remains one of my favorite Granta reads.)", "Bill Bryson has become something like my spiritual guide. Taken together, his works form a roadmap for living life as a middle-aged, oversensitive, bookish, misanthropic, curious, and curiously inept man; and I am following his lead into the sunset. This book was particularly relevant for me, because I recently returned to New York to renew my visa. Like Bryson, I would be seeing my native land after a spell abroad (although my time away was much shorter). As usual, I got the audiobook version so I could savor his delicate voice and charming transatlantic accent. The whole experience warms my heart.I\u2019m a Stranger Here Myself originated as a newspaper column for a British magazine, written about the trials of moving back to the United States after living his whole adult life in England. As such, this book is more of a collection than a unified whole. The subject jumps from buying fax machines to filing immigration paperwork, from playing ball with his son to gardening with his wife, not to mention thanksgiving, hair cuts, spell checkers, air travel, the economy, and much else. Strangely enough, the imposed brevity of a newspaper column allows us to see more of Bryson, not less. He mainly writes about whatever is on his mind, and frequently lapses into autobiography. We meet his wife and kids, examine his memories of his childhood, and get a tour of his town. If you like Bryson, this will be delightful; and if not, not.As far as the ostensible subject goes\u2014and I say ostensible because Bryson often strays from it\u2014I cannot say Bryson quite captures the experience of seeing American culture from a distance. He remarks that people here eat too much, walk too little, and consequently weigh too much. He notes our preoccupation with rules, our predilection for junk food, our reflexively optimistic attitude. To his credit, Bryson presciently condemns American xenophobia and our disastrous \u2018War on Drugs\u2019. But in general his observations seem rather superficial. Certainly he is no Tocqueville.I cannot resist including one of my own observations here. The thing that has most struck me upon moving back is the paranoia. There was a heat wave when I arrived, and everybody was worrying about it. When it gets cold, we\u2019ll worry about that too. My family and friends are all biting their nails about this election. Indeed, I think it\u2019s fair to say that fear has taken over this election season. On the right, they\u2019re worried about immigrants, Muslims, communists, and Clinton; and on the left, we\u2019re mainly worried about the possibility of a Trump presidency. When I turn on the local news I see there\u2019s been a murder in Brooklyn, a man struck by lightning in Queens, and a fire in Manhattan. In other news, there might be something wrong with our water, certain foods might kill you, and certain hair products might cause cancer. And don\u2019t forget that a terrible epidemic is on the horizon.This example is just to show that Bryson could have gone much further in his cultural analysis. But the book is not meant to be a serious work of cultural criticism, so I suppose it\u2019s unfair to fault a lighthearted collection of newspaper columns for being trivial. The pieces here were not meant to change your life or open your eyes, but to provide a modest dose of entertaining reading. And that\u2019s what they do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go practice my transatlantic accent.", "I normally love Bill Bryson's books. Unfortunately, I could swear this one was written by Andy Rooney.", "This is the first Bill Bryson book I have read, which, I am told, was a mistake. I know several people who consider Bryson one of their favorite authors and they all seem to agree that this book is not a good \"ambassador\" for the rest of his work. This book is a collection of newspaper articles that document his move from England to the United States. Most of them explain his bewilderment toward American culture and customs and often longs for the \"simplicity\" of the British lifestyle. I was originally under the impression that Bryson was British himself, until I discovered that he was born in Des Moines and moved to England at 24. He has spent the same amount of time in both countries, but it seems like he prefers to consider himself British. That's weird. The articles are funny and short, which make for a quick read. At times, however, his humor was a bit over the top and somewhat whiny. I am excited to give Bryson another chance with his highly recommended \"A Walk in the Woods\" but I would not suggest this book to friends.", "If you like reading brief, amusing but unrelated snippets about the oddities of life, this may be the book for you. There\u2019s nothing very original in it, but some readers no doubt enjoy the empathy of saying \u201cOh, I\u2019ve always thought that too\u201d.It\u2019s a collection of short articles written for a weekly British news magazine about adapting to life in the US, after 20 years living in Britain \u2013 comparing the two countries and comparing the US of his youth with the version he now finds himself in. And guess what he finds in the US? Computer help desks are annoying; Americans are litigious and always want to blame someone else; the news is xenophobic; Toys R Us is a silly name; spell checkers are annoying and not very useful; irony is uncommon; obesity is a problem and there are helplines for all consumer products, including dental floss.Whilst it\u2019s often quite funny, I prefer a book, whether fact or fiction, to have some sort of sequence. This would be better as source material for standup routines of observational comedy (or in its original form).Because it was written for a British audience, it\u2019s accessible even to those with little experience or knowledge of the US (whereas Notes from a Small Island needs quite a lot of explanation to some US readers).Of its kind, I suppose it is pretty good (4*), but as I didn\u2019t especially enjoy it, I\u2019ll only give it 3*. (I bought it in a single volume with Notes from a Small Island and assumed it was a similar travelogue, but set in the US.)", "Bill Bryson grew up in Iowa, then spent twenty years in England. He has returned to the U.S. with his British wife and children. I'm a Stranger Here is selections from his newspaper column which chronicles his experiences. Some of them are funny, like \"Dying Accents\" and \"The Best American Holiday\". Others, particularly anything is which he tries to mock the writing style on instructional booklets, electronics, the government (I'm all for mocking the government, but he just doesn't do it well), are overreaching and dull. He also has the annoying habit of showing off a keen sense of understanding, both of general topics and the English language, and then goes on long rambling paragraphs about how he doesn't understand anything.", "It pains me to say this because I just read, and LOVED, A Short History of Nearly Everything by the same author, but I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America after Twenty Years Away was shockingly dull. I wasn't a fan of the audiobook narrator, who comically overacted, and the content was so dated that I could barely relate to it anymore. If you like lots (and I mean LOTS) of complaining about topics such as telemarketers, having to use ID to get on an airplane, having to actually put an address on a letter to get it delivered, and people being friendly, then this book is for you. Too much whinging for me."], "Annals of the Former World": ["Absolutely, bar none, the finest work of American natural science that I've ever read. McPhee has the eye of a scientist and the soul of a poet, and it makes for truly astonishing writing. I don't like to pile on the superlatives, but this is probably one of my ten favorite books of all time.", "If by some fiat, I had to restrict all this writing to one sentence; this is the one I would choose: the summit of Mount Everest is marine limestone.\u201d \u2015 John McPhee, Annals of the Former WorldWhat I absolutely love about McPhee's nonfiction is his ability to write about place, people and ideas with both beautiful prose and amazing intimacy. My favorite parts are where McPhee weaves place and people, or people and ideas together and establishes the grand metaphor for his book. McPhee picks up pieces of conversation with geologists and their satelites that might get missed by most other writers, but manages to find, keep and eventually place these nuggets into his book (written over 20 years) in a way that works to support his big themes. Seriously, this book is one of my favorite nonfiction works of all time. You can see the mark McPhee left on his students' writing if you've ever read Robert Wright, Richard Preston or New Yorker editor David Remnick. Some consider McPhee to be the godfather of New New Journalism, but he is much more than that. IMHO, he is the godfather of modern nonfiction writing, period.", "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world. If that is an age you can reach, I don\u2019t want to. I can\u2019t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light. I\u2019ve said this before, but in another life, I must have been a geologist. Or like McPhee, at least making a study of that place where language and the earth overlap. Nothing fascinates me more.This was beyond fantastic. I\u2019ll keep reading it for years.", "This was my first foray into John McPhee's work. And a weighty foray it was : This hefty tome consists of four previously-published McPhee books assembled into one spine, augmented with a fifth chapter.McPhee's often staccato prose takes the reader on a tour of the geology of the lower 48, as seen largely in the roadcuts of Interstate 80, separated into five major segments : the Appalachians, the Midwest, Wyoming, Nevada, and California. Although I found myself lacking an understanding of various exotic rock names as I read (serpentine ? gabbro ?), McPhee successfully weaves into his description of the physical world a fantastic, much larger, and more profound story that's compelling and universal. McPhee uses the rock in North America to motivate explorations of plate tectonics, the history of geology, and even to some extent the development of modern science in general. This book is ultimately an exploration of how the world we walk on came to be the way we see it today, and as such it hints at what might come to pass long into the future. The writing is focused almost exclusively on the rock and the processes that surround the rock, so the reader should at least have a passing interest in geology. But McPhee's clarity and enthusiasm show through in nearly every facet of the work, and I think that's what makes it a good read.", "As a geology major, a former gold miner, and finally as a hydrogeologist, the earth and its water have always fascinated me. Reading John McPhee is always a delight because he takes what remains mostly a poorly done body of work in mostly scientific terms and turns an explanation of how the earth came to be into a readable and engaging topic. Something just about anyone can enjoy provided they have the curiosity and interest in wondering how so much stunning geography came to be where it is and what it is.Well done John McPhee!Great Read!", "It may seem odd, but this book takes my breath away and makes me feel alive. It is about geology, and how McPhee spent years with geologists trying to make sense of the science and present it in an interesting and engaging way. I think they call it \u201cbig picture\u201d geology and it is one of my favorite topics in life. I love most the paragraphs where he takes us from New Jersey to California say in Triassic time (250 million years ago) and describes the terrain; then turns us around 200 million years later and describes the changes: desert instead of ocean, mountains instead of prairie, etc. I do not have the memory to even memorize a bit of what he writes, but reading it over and over makes my mind fly and I am there, and I am watching the earth turn and the oceans rise and fall and the land change colors and mountains reaching for the sky and then being worn away. I don\u2019t know what else to write, it is just that perfect and indescribable.", "I've only read parts of this book, since there are many different books included in this version of his geologic exploration of a cross-section of the US. I have a few things to say. #1. Read Rising from the Plains as you're driving in the Tetons. #2. Read any other section as you're driving in the area described. Your road trip will become something entirely different if you can see what you're reading about. #3. Read these books when you're planning a trip to any of the areas discussed. #4. Just read them. John McPhee does connect things better than most writers of text about geology. He makes it accessible while also staying interesting for those \"in the know.\" And the people who are part of the geologic history of a place, like the mappers and surveyers are not mere footnotes in his writing. Oh no, they are the main characters, out for adventure and getting a lot of it along the way.", "A most excellent remedy for insomnia, and (speaking as a sufferer) I do not mean that pejoratively. The perfect book for reading a little bit at bedtime every night, easy to pick up and put down, but still worth the reading. It lasted me about 6 weeks; not sure what I'll use now. (Well, I suppose there's still E. O. Wilson's The Ants, but I'm not sure my arms are strong enough to hold it up...)Layer by layer, McPhee sediments one's grasp of deep time, and of the geologists who study it. A little too accessible to be called \"magisterial\", but it still evokes that feeling. I would also recommend it as an antidote for the news. Highly recommended, not that it apparently needs my approval. I'm glad it won the Pulitzer, in its day.Ta, L.", "This book has a rhythm unlike anything else I've read, just like geology has a timescale that takes some time to wrap your head around. It's like an opera. Geology and opera both have a reputation of being long and boring, but they are also majestic and complex. This book is long, but it's not boring! For a while, when I first started this book, my three-year-old wanted me to read every other page to her--the words were like poetry. You can't read it quickly. Reading out loud helped me settle down to the book's pace. There are lots of big words: some of the geology geek persuasion, others of the English major nerd variety...but I wasn't constantly reaching for a dictionary. McPhee throws a new geology term at you, repeats it in multiple contexts so that you get a sense of the thing, and then offers a more complete definition, just in case you still need help. It's engaging.At first I was a little bothered by the lack of photographs of everything. McPhee uses a thousand words to make a picture, but I still wouldn't recognize welded tuff if it was right in front of me. I wanted a modernized, six minute YouTube clip series complete with reality TV interviews with the geologists right at the road cut...I'm not sure I would have savored that as much though. And also, the ideas still get through. I don't want to be a geologist, and I don't need to memorize what all the rocks look like. But I have a much better picture of the complexities of the idea of plate tectonics, what it explains, what it doesn't. And while I'm sure some of the ideas presented in the book are dated, the big picture of geology hasn't changed too much from the public's perspective in the last twenty some-odd years.Each book described some section of geology along Interstate 80, as well as the background of the geologist that McPhee accompanies during that stretch of land. (You really don't have to read the books in order, if you don't want to.) Rising from the Plains was my favorite. The geologist, David Love, had a childhood much like Ralph Moody (who wrote the Little Britches series), and Love's story is woven into the geology of Wyoming beautifully. What an adventure!", "Probably one of the best books I have ever read. Be prepared for some geologic rigamarole and a sense of patience and the timeline of ages will unfold. Its a compilation of all of McPhee's writings about American continental Geology. I know, sounds dull, but he uses the lives and characters of the Geologists whose work he is describing along with the massive narrative arc of plate tectonics and the history of the science itself. The story of America's westward expansion along with the Romantic era of northeastern America all seem to blend into a text that can miraculously also explain geomorphology and other remarkably dry topics. Gives the vast expanses of time a tiny human scale which we can then wonder at how our ancestors saw these places as well as the painstaking detective work that was critical to our understanding of how they formed, where these places came from and how in something as seemingly stolid as the ground beneath our feet is a plastic and still changing skin manipulated by forces beyond human comprehension. Utterly beautiful work\u2013I know of nothing else like it."], "Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe": ["Bryson at his worst. He is the whining American tourist he claims to detest. Meandering through a dozen or so european countries, he manages to complain about virtually every hotel accomodation. And for christ sake Bill, put a freakin map in your book. I'm not totally ignorant when it comes to european geography but if youre gonna write about travelling hundreds of miles every other day, i'd like to glance at the route with out having to bust out my world atlas.After Shorthistoryof nearly everything i was so high on him, now this...", "I'm a fan of Bill Bryson.I'm not a fan of the complaining, whingeing, swilling pleb who wrote this travel book. No, this is too harsh. But I do feel a little ripped off only because I know how interesting a Bill Bryson book can be. There's no history in this book, there's no culture, there is very little interesting stories. Here is what it felt like:So I got off the train at Hergenbootensberg and it was raining. Why does it always rain when I travel? The place was a dirty shithole and no one spoke English at all. I went to a travel desk and complained to them and then asked them to find me a room for the night.The room was full of mildew and smelt like an armpit. So I smoked. There were no restaurants open just McDonalds everywhere I could see. So I ate a burger and complained to the workers there about their weird foreign McDonalds burgers.The next day I walked 10 miles to a rich principality. They were all rich and I was poor. It was shit. So I walked back to my hotel and stole the towels. And then I smoked. I'll be onto Belgium soon.", "This book hits the sweet spot: Bill Bryson travels around Europe, entertaining us with his humor and thoughtful observations, and also sharing memories of a similar trip he took in the 1970s with his bumbling friend, Stephen Katz.Ah, poor Stephen. If you have read Bryson's book A Walk in the Woods, which is about hiking the Appalachian Trail, you will remember Mr. Katz as the comic foil, the ridiculously overweight guy who complained a lot and who threw away critical supplies because they were too heavy in his pack. Here is how Bryson introduces Stephen in Neither Here nor There:\"Katz was the sort of person who would lie in a darkened hotel room while you were trying to sleep and talk for hours in graphic, sometimes luridly perverted, detail about what he would like to do to various high school nymphets, given his druthers and some of theirs, or announce his farts by saying, 'Here comes a good one. You ready?' and then grade them for volume, duration, and odorosity, as he called it. The best thing that could be said about traveling abroad with Katz was that it spared the rest of America from having to spend the summer with him.\"Hahaha! This book frequently made me laugh out loud and want to read passages to friends, but of course I had trouble getting the words out because I couldn't stop laughing. It wasn't just stories about Katz that I enjoyed. Bryson toured all over Europe -- he started in Hammerfest, Norway, to see the Northern Lights, then jetted over to Paris, then Brussels, Cologne, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Rome, Naples, Florence, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Yugoslavia and Istanbul. (That isn't even a complete list, but you get the idea -- he literally traveled from one end of Europe to the other.)While in Istanbul, Bryson decides he is finally ready to return to England:\"I had come to the end of my own road. That was Asia over there; this was as far as I could go in Europe. It was time to end this long indulgence and go home ... And I was, I admit, ready to go. I missed my family and the comfortable familiarities of life. I was tired of the daily drudgery of keeping myself fed and bedded, tired of trains and buses, tired of existing in a world of strangers, tired of being forever perplexed and lost, tired above all of my own dull company. How many times in recent days had I sat trapped on buses or trains listening to my idly prattling mind and wished that I could just get up and walk out on myself? At the same time, I had a quite irrational urge to keep going. There is something about the momentum of travel that makes you want to just keep moving, to never stop.\"This book was first published in 1992, but Bryson's comments and anecdotes were so thoughtful and entertaining that it still felt relevant. I listened to this on audio, read by the author, and as I have said many times before, Bryson is a delightful narrator. The next time you get the blues, get yourself a Bill Bryson book and it will cheer you right up.", "Three and a half stars rounded up.It\u2019s never a good idea to read Bill Bryson on public transportation. Stifling belly laughs can be painful and the resulting noise sounds like something between strangling an aardvark and air rapidly escaping from a balloon.The benefits: Fellow commuters won\u2019t look you in the eye and go out of their way to avoid you, so I practically have the whole train car to myself.This is one of Bryson\u2019s earlier books, so it\u2019s long on humor, random observations and anecdotes, and short on insight. He comes off as a lightweight Paul Theroux; however, I was in the mood for laughs and there are plenty contained here.My previous Bryson book was A Walk in the Woods, so it was nice to hear more about everyone\u2019s nightmare travelling companion, Stephen Katz, even it was via flashback. Not only does Katz have awful luck with bird\u2019s crapping on his head, but he has the singular worst pick up line ever.", "I had a rather curious experience while reading this book. Because I'll be in Europe shortly, and I've been on a Bryson binge anyway, I downloaded the audiobook onto my phone and began listening. I took a walk and was merrily following along, until, at about one third of the way through, a thought flashed through my mind\u2014This book sucks! I was taken by surprise, because up until then I thought I'd been enjoying it. But the further I read, the more my judgment was justified. I'm sorry to say this, Bill, but this book is not very good.To put it briefly, Bryson comes across as extremely immature in this book, both as a writer and as a person. He tries hard to be funny, but too often ends up making jokes about cultural stereotypes\u2014Italians are bad drivers, the French are rude, and so on\u2014or simply engaging in hyperbolic descriptions of extremely ordinary events, which unfortunately only serve to magnify their ordinariness rather than to alleviate it. This book contains very few of Bryson's trademark little-known anecdotes, and almost nothing that could be deemed insightful about the places he visits. He spends a distressing about of time talking about hotels and restaurants\u2014mostly to complain about them\u2014and more than once ends up eating in a McDonald's. Bryson even complains that a menu in a German restaurant was written in German. He might as well have stayed at home.I am, however, happy to report that Bryson has shown a definite progress in his writing ability and worldview over the years. In chronological order, of Bryson's books I've read Neither Here nor There (1993), Notes from a Small Island (1995), A Walk in the Woods (1998), In a Sunburned Country (2000), and A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003). And in terms of quality, I would rank them in the same order. So however immature he may have been, at least he's shaped up; and it's a great sign when people are able to change for the better.", "Bryson writes hysterical travel books. In this one he sets out to re-create a backpacking trip of Europe he made during the seventies when he was twenty. His descriptions of people and places will have you falling out of your chair. The beer he is offered in Belgium, for example, defies his palate. He just can\u2019t associate the taste with any previous experience, but finally decides it puts him in mind of a very large urine sample, possibly from a circus animal. (He should have stuck with Coca-Cola, nicht wahr, Wendell?) Bryson has truly captured some of the giddy enjoyment that I experience when traveling in a foreign country where one does not speak the language. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that excites a greater sense of childlike wonder than to be in a country where you are ignorant of almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can\u2019t read anything. You have only the most rudimentary sense of how things work. . . . Your whole existence becomes a series of interestingguesses.\u201dAt the Arc de Triomphe, some thirteen streets come together. \u201cCan you imagine? I mean to say, here you have a city with the world\u2019s most pathologically aggressive drivers -- who in other circumstances would be given injections of valium from syringes the size of basketball jumps and confined to their beds with leather straps -- and you give them an open space where they can all go in any of thirteen directions at once. Is that asking for trouble or what?\u201dInterspersed are salient comments about traveling on European trains. \u201cThere is no scope for privacy and of course there is nothing like being trapped in a train compartment on a long journey to bring all those unassuageable little frailties of the human body crowding to the front of your mind \u2013 the withheld fart, the three and a half square yards of boxer shorts that have somehow become concertinaed between your buttocks, the Kellogg\u2019s corn flake that is unaccountably lodged deep in your left nostril,\u201d. . .and rude comments about the Swiss: \u201cWhat do you call a gathering of boring people in Switzerland? Zurich.\u201d He reveals some funny stories about himself. \u201cI had no gift for woodworking. Everyone else in the class was building things like cedar chests and oceangoing boats and getting to play with dangerous and noisy power tools, but I had to sit at the Basics Table with Tubby Tucker and a kid who was so stupid that I don't think we ever learned his name. We just called him 'Drooler.' The three of us weren't allowed anything more dangerous than sandpaper and Elmer's Glue, so we would sit week after week making little nothings out of offcuts, except for Drooler, who would just eat the glue. Mr. Dreck never missed a chance to humiliate me. 'And what is this?' he would say, seizing some mangled block of wood on which I had been laboring for the last twenty-seven weeks and holding it aloft for the class to titter at. 'I've beenteaching shop for sixteen years, Mr. Bryson, and I have to say this is the worst beveled edge I've ever seen.' He held up a birdhouse of mine once and it just collapsed in his hands. The class roared. Tubby Tucker laughed so hard that he almost choked. He laughed for twenty minutes, even when I whispered to him across the table that if he didn't stop it I would bevel his testicles.\"It used to be -- not as common now as formerly -- that each public washroom had an attendant whose job it was to keep everything clean, and you were expected to drop in some change for his or her income. The sex of the attendant was irrelevant to the sex of the washroom and Bryson had difficulty getting used to the idea of some cleaning lady watching him urinate to make sure he didn't \"dribble on the tiles or pocket any of the urinal cakes. It is hard enough to pee when you are aware that someone's eyes are on you, but when you fear that at any moment you will be felled by a rabbit chop to the kidneys for taking too much time, you seize up altogether. You couldn't have cleared my system with Drano. So eventually I would zip up and return unrelieved to the table [in the restaurant:], and spend the night back at the hotel doing a series of Niagara Falls impressions.\"Bryson does not mince words, and his perspective on former Austrian president Waldheim echoes mine but is perhaps more trenchant. \u201cI fully accept Dr. Waldheim\u2019s explanation that when he saw forty thousand Jews being loaded onto cattle trucks at Salonika, he genuinely believed they were being sent to the seaside for a holiday. For the sake of fairness, I should point out that Waldheim insists he never even knew that the Jews of Salonika were being shipped off to Auschwitz. And let\u2019s be fair again \u2013 they accounted for no more than one third of the city\u2019s entire population (italics theirs), and it is of course entirely plausible that a high-ranking Nazi officer in the district could have been unaware of what was happening within his area of command. Let\u2019s give the man a break. I mean to say, when the Sturmabteilung, or stormtroopers, burned down forty-two of Vienna\u2019s forty three synagogues during Kristallnacht, Waldheim did wait a whole week before joining theunit. . . . Christ, the man was practically a resistance hero. . . .Austrians should be proud of him and proud of themselves for having the courage to stand up to world opinion and elect a man of his caliber, overlooking the fact that he is a pathological liar. . .that he has a past so mired in mis-truths that no one but he knows what he has done. It takes a special kind of people to stand behind a man like that.\u201d", "Huh. Turns out Bryson is a dirty ol' bugger!This travel-across-Europe journal is fun, educational and entertaining. I love travel and I like learning about far-off places. Europe has been done and overdone, yet I still find it fascinating. Bryson's recollections are from when he wrote the book in the '90s as well as from a previous trip he and his friend Katz took. Regardless of when the reminisces come from, details ring true from the experiences I've had of the same places, such Paris and parts of Italy. Apparently some things never change. However, it was cool to get his take on the place. At times he gets a little grumpy, but overall this is lighthearted and goodnatured. He has a adequate store of patience and his take-it-as-it-comes attitude keeps most of this from sinking into endless gripes.Fun as this was, it's not my favorite of the six or so of Bryon's works I've read to this point. I haven't found this in his later books, but earlier on his writing seems to show a distracting obsession with sex. That's fine. I mean, I'm a dirty bird too, but I really don't want to know about the fetishes of a mid-aged man. I am one and it's not pretty. Hey, I'm sure that's someone's bag. Somewhere out there some sad sod is thinking, \"I wonder what gets boring, bald and wrinkled old Phil from accounting off?\" But that's not me...not yet anyhow. Who knows maybe someday my sexuality will warp in an unexpected way.Oh, who am I kidding...*zip*", "This book was highly entertaining at times, I can't say it wasn't. In fact, it was highly entertaining most of the time. However, I can't say I learned hardly anything about any of the places Bill Bryson visited. He reserves most of his commentary for how far he walked to get to a train station, how fast or slow the train rides were, and how cornflake-sized bugars feel in his nose while on those train rides...I hate to bash authors...that's not what I'm trying to do here. I am simply trying to say Bryson's book was not what I was expecting and did not give me what I look for in reading travel novels (I like to get a grasp of what different places are like, the ambience, the people, maybe a little history). Also, it was about a year ago that I read this book, and I am sure some of these tidbits were woven into his writing. However, I do remember feeling let down at the time and coming to the conclusion that inserting this sort of substance into his writing was not his main focus, although it may have slipped in somewhere along the way.", "The reason I read this book is because there have been some excellent extracts from it in the course books I teach from. Unfortunately I think those extracts were actually the best bits... I certainly learnt nothing new from reading the entire book.Bryson is funny, but after a while he comes across as whiny and just a touch xenophobic. I've never quite understood the point of travelling and then asking for 'something that would pass for food in America' to eat.Furthermore, the chapter structure became a little tiresome after a while: the routine of arrive, find hotel, have steaming hot shower/bath, wander round town, have something to eat was rarely deviated from.Perhaps this book was considered quite differently at the time of publishing, before the era of cheap flights meant Europe was easily accessible to all.", "Why bother to actually travel when you can just regurgitate stereotypes that have been passed around since man invented borders? Honest to God, he really complains about haughty Parisian waiters. I didn\u2019t find anything in this book of essays to be even remotely insightful and I don\u2019t ever find Bryson to be funny. Most of what I have read by him is just a collection of his gripes against the rest of humanity. I have never read any of his travel stuff where he actually meets an interesting person who has something worth saying. When I first read this several years ago I just figured that it was the first thing Bryson wrote, perhaps when he was a college student packbacking around Europe. It was published when he was 48 years old. It is completely lacking in the sort of wisdom you would expect from a writer in full middle age. I like most of his non-travel books just so you won't think that I have it in for this guy. He just seems to hate to travel and he despises everyone he meets along the way.

They have to stand there rigid and appearing to be unconcerned while sprightly Dale hops around, derides them horribly, and slaps their chops with a large haddock. I would give this book 5 stars, but mostly, Dale is beating up on authors I haven't read and - now! - have no intention of reading, so it's mostly somebody else's (beautifully invectivised) argument. The authors here dissected, filleted and grossly insulted who I never read are :Sven BirkertsColson WhiteheadJamaica KincaidTerry McMillanJim CraceStanley CrouchRick Moodyand the ones I have read areDFWKurt VonnegutJulian BarnesSapphirePhilip RothSo I guess this is the hipster version of B R Myers' A Reader's Manifesto which denounced certain American literary authors for their pretensions and general wanky unreadability. Here's Dale speaking generally :even taking into consideration the theory that cinematic and virtual media have displaced the printed word as the dominant narrative form and that the novel and its grown-too-big-for-its-britches sibling, the memoir, are only occasionally profitable anachronisms; even recognising that literary standards and technological advances have made it theoretically feasible for just about anyone to write and publish a book [Dale was writing in 2004] - even considering all these factors, the number of Stepford novels that are written, published, reviewed, and read every year is completely out of control. ....Blame the writing programs and the prize committees, blame the deconstructionist literary critics or the back-patting Siamese-twinned professions of writing and reviewing fiction, blame any or all of the identity communities who read and write those ethnic-or-gender-marketed booster books or blame the dead white European males who forced us to resort to Literature as our Daily Affirmation in the first place. And here's a flavour of his specific charges - first, against Stanley Crouch :Crouch is neither virtuosic nor possessed of good marksmanship; he's just another demagogue in an age that confuses demagoguery with honesty; a black man who uses the veil of anti-pc polemic to make criticisms of black culture that white Americans are either too cowed or too smart to put forth themselves... suffice it to say that here is one black man calling other black men monkeys, denying blackness to those African Americans who fail to live up to his standards and conferring it on those who do. ... Don't the Moon Look Lonesome is a terrible novel, badly conceived, badly executed, and put forward in bad faith...and now David Foster Wallace :What makes Infinite Jest's success even more noteworthy is that it is, in a word, terrible. Other words I might use include bloated, boring, gratuitous and - perhaps especially - uncontrolled. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that infinite Jest is one of the very few novels for which the phrase \"not worth the paper it's printed on\" has real meaning at least in an ecological sense; but to resort to such hyperbole would be to fall into the rut that characterizes many reviews of this novel... I resent the five weeks of my life I gave over to reading the thing; I resent every endlessly over-elaborated gag in the book, like a ten-page riff on why video telephones are unviable, or the dozen pages on the teenager who won all his tennis matches by playing with a pistol held to his head, or the thousands and thousands and thousands of words devoted to pharmaceutical trivia on all sorts of mind-altering drugs.... I could, a la Edward Said, accuseWallace of cultural colonialism in the peppering of his otherwise exclusively white male text with exoticized African-Americans, women, and homosexuals, and, further, I think the case can be made that the narrative technique Wallace has derived from Pynchon is nothing more than a watered-down de(homo)-eroticized style that lives on Sontag's \"barren edge of Camp\".You may not agree with Dale, but I still recommed his book, because for some of us bookish types, it's the nearest thing to a bracing walk in a drench of freezing rain on a cliff path with crumbly edges and no guard rail.", "A nasty, boring book in which someone whose talent appears to have sputtered out years previously, attempted to gain some notoriety by taking a hatchet to the work of others. Sour grapes much, Dale? At least Jonathan Franzen has some talent to back up his obnoxious public persona. With this author there's all the obnoxiousness and very little talent.", "For the most part, Dale Peck is a smart reader and a fluent writer. I like a bold opinion and I love a withering screed. Several of the targets of Peck's criticism (I'm looking at you Sven Birkerts and Stanley Crouch) are overdue for a take-down and, uncharitable blowhards themselves, they'll get no crocodile tears from me. But the net result of reading these relentlessly nasty reviews in a collection was a dislike of Dale Peck that grew with each essay. I guess it's like comic relief in a thriller - the funny parts make the scary parts scarier. Similarly, a little generosity in a critic makes harsh critical judgments seem a little more righteous. The unmixed bile on offer here is a disagreeable read. Peck's self-pitying complaints to the contrary, no one is trying to 'silence' him by labeling him a bitch. His bitchy tone assaults anyone with a metaphorical ear. Straw silencers, be damned! Peck can defend the still-beating heart of literature (his actual image, I kid you not*) with all the catty poison at his command. He may be the very soul of literary rectitude, but I don't like his company and I won't be spending any more time with him. There's entirely too much else to read out there.*For someone with such sniffy, Brahminical sensibilities, Peck's own writing is replete with howlers like this in addition to appalling freshman comp mistakes such as subject/verb disagreement. Pretentious pseudo-sophisticate, heal thyself!", "I don't have much patience for pompous blowhards. Pompous blowhard, thy name is Dale Peck.Are there some valid points made in this book? Yes, some. That being said, I have far more respect when the opinions come from someone who has talent that outshines those who are the subject of the harsh criticism. Peck is not even close. It's as though a man who has crafted an adequate stained glass window turns around and starts screaming at the ghost of Louis Comfort Tiffany for producing \"schlock.\" Sorry, Mr. Peck, but until you achieve the level of artistry as many of the authors you skewer, you don't have the wherewithal to paint yourself as the uber-lord of literature looking down your nose at \"middlebrow drivel\u201d that\u2019s \u201ccelebrated in excess.\u201dPeck might better spend his time working on his own craft rather than tearing down the works of others.Criticism is one thing, but jealous beat downs without backup is something else altogether.", "While it's wrong to laud a critic merely for agreeing with me, that's what I'm going to do.Peck doesn't really assert these points so much as posit them on his way to dismember his contemporaries, but since I find them excellent literary axioms, I'll repeat them:-James Joyce's collection Dubliners--particularly the story \"The Dead\"--is one of the best in the prose fiction canon, but by Ulysses he is setting a pretty poor example.-Thomas Pynchon is undeniably a fantastic writer but his his novels don't come together as anything approaching a cohesive whole.-The folks who started postmodernism understood the difference between identification and projection, but most practitioners today work without this distinction, which while very convenient for them, is very boring to read.-The critic Sven Birkerts is overrated.", "\"It seems to me that there are two strains of literature currently in vogue - what I have referred to...as recherch\u00e9 postmodernism and recidivist realism - and both of them, in my opinion, suck,\" writes Dale Peck. \"As one reads contemporary novelists, one can't shake the feeling that they write for one another rather than some more or less common reader. Their prose shares a showiness that speaks of solidarity and competition...\" I certainly don't disagree with his conclusions that much of current fiction is highly undesirable, but B.R. Myers in A Reader's Manifesto: An Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in American Literary Prose explained it better and more coherently.", "He really dislikes some of the authors I like (DFW and Jonathan Franzen), but Peck has a sharp critical eye and a very engaging/caustic style. There is a very complimentary essay on Kurt Vonnegut at the end of the book, though, and that warmed my heart. I'm glad he doesn't hate everything.", "An awful bunch of tantrums, written solely to garner the author some brief attention. I think he's writing teenage vampire sci-fi novels now, which, enough said.", "Well, as my dad used to say, \"If you can't say something mean and funny . . . then just say something mean.\" Dale Peck works that maxim all the way to the bitter end."], "Rising from the Plains": ["In Rising from the Plains, John McPhee takes us on an exciting and fascinating road trip throughout Wyoming with geologist David Love. The first half of the book is a beautiful blend of Wyoming geology, and the history of Love\u2019s family as they move into the Wind River Basin region in the early twentieth century. The second half of the book continues with geology of the Rocky Mountain region, but also includes a high-level look at the United States and how it affected western geology.I enjoyed McPhee\u2019s descriptive writing style. He has a way of transporting you back in time millions of years with his vivid descriptions of flora and fauna. In the beginning of the book is a map of Wyoming showing the different geological areas and a chart outlining the different eras. I\u2019m a sucker for a good map, and I found the chart extremely helpful. My only complaint was the lack of paragraph breaks. Sometimes entire pages were one long paragraph, and for me this made reading a bit of work. I know this is petty, but it was enough of a distraction for me that I felt I needed to mention it.If you love geology and western history I would highly recommend this book!", "''Most maps are patched together from various papers and reports. Dave has looked at all the rock. It's all in one mind. Most geologic maps are maps of time, not rocks.\"-- Malcolm McKenna, quoted in John McPhee's Rising from the PlainsI am nearly finished with the individual portions of Annals of the Former World (Basin and Range \u2611, In Suspect Terrain \u2611, Assembling California \u2611). All I have left is to read the section 'Crossing the Craton' (a forty-page addition to his 40th parallel/I-80 project that filled in the blank in the map and allowed the publishers of 'Annals of the Former World' some additional McPhee text not found in the four main books/sections previously published to incentivize McPhee's fans to fork out the addtional $35 in 1998 to get the whole brilliant McPhee mess).I read these books a little out of order over a little over the last year. I started off well with 'Basin & Range', 'In Suspect Terrain', but then jumped to 'Assembling California' since a couple of weeks ago I was going to be driving through California and figured it would be nice to have some geology of the geography I was going to be driving through next to me. While I was a little disappointed with 'Assembling California', I loved 'Rising from the Plains'. I don't know if it was a return to my roots (Wyoming and Snake River and Mormon Country), or the fact that this book seemed just to excite McPhee more. You could tell he loved the Loves (David Love: Yale educated geologist, cowboy; John Love: David's father, mirthful Scot rancher/cowboy, nephew of John Muir; Ethel Waxham Love: David's mother, teacher, writer). He threads this family's golden personality and history with the geology and geography of Wyoming.These books are dangerous and should not be given to children. I am keeping them locked up with my William S. Burroughs, Henry Miller, etc. If my son or daughter (no field geology sexist me) were to discover these McPhee books too young (s)he might just grow up to be a passionate field geologist. Reading this as I near my 40s, McPhee almost makes me want to take up a hammer, hop on a horse, and ride into the mountains.I give it four stars, simply because 'Coming into the Country' still exists for me as a slightly better book, but I think the combined energy of all of the 'Annals' is definitely amazing.", "This book was phenomenal.It is a must read for anyone interested in Rocky Mountain geology, or in getting a glimpse into the American west.This book has been republished in McPhee's larger Annals of a Former World. It is a biography of the famous Wyoming geologist, J. David Love. But it also gives a beautiful overview of the geology of Wyoming through Love's eyes.Some of the geology is a bit outdated, but it does not distract from the greater good.", "This is the third time I've read Rising from the Plains and it seems as fresh today as when I first read it for a geology class back in the mid-90's. John McPhee, who wrote for the The New York Times for many years, is an engaging writer and in this book weaves the geology of the high plains with the story of famed Rocky Mountain geologist David Love and his family, who settled in central Wyoming in the first decade of the twentieth century. Having lived in Wyoming myself, I am familiar with the area about which he writes. Wyoming is filled with unexpected landscapes that are awesome, forbidding and beautiful. Even if you don't understand the geological terms or timeline, the book can be enjoyed for its depiction of ranch life in one of the harshest environments in the continental U.S.and the pure pleasure of McPhee's prose. The Wyoming landscape is unique in the world and is composed of many mountain ranges in addition to the well-known Rockies and Tetons. The Rocky Mountains are new mountains, relatively speaking, that have covered older ranges. That is the case across the state; new ranges moved or enfolded older ranges pushing them every which way. Water has carved anomalies like the Devil's Footprint and Flaming Gorge. Wind has played an even larger role in shaping the landscape. There are fossils galore and along the I-80 corridor one views rock stratification created over millions of years, from the earliest days of our continent through later ages until more recent geological time - 10 million years ago. I highly recommend this book, it's one of my favorites not only because of the memories it evokes but also because geology fascinates me and John McPhee, who does an excellent job of showing why.", "While studying general Wyoming history I learned by happy happenstance of John McPhee's 1986 book Rising From the Plains, which unfolds the geological story of the state from the perspective of those American Western pioneers and their descendants who have inhabited the land for the last century. Wyoming geologist David Love is McPhee's focal point. It's challenging to pin down this book. It's a portrait of Wyoming's geology, but also of David Love and his family, and occasionally it's more free-flowing nature writing. While McPhee's material is arranged in a distinctively unusual, if not idiosyncratic, manner, his writing is lovely and always riveting. Even if you are, like I, essentially ignorant of the fundamentals of geology, this book is sure to come as a revelation. I cannot imagine how anyone who discovers this book can fail to be moved by the stateliness of Love's chosen field of study, or by the greater story that the adventure of science collectively has to unfold.Through a second act of synchronicity while reading this book I stumbled across Ken Burns' 1996 PBS video series called The West. Episode 8 contains extended interviews with David Love in which considerable portions recounted in McPhee's book are recounted. I would advise anyone who enjoys this book to seek out that documentary as well.", "Mind-numbingly abstruse. I don't see how anyone who is not in the geology field could find this book remotely accessible. Maybe I just lack the intellectual curiosity or capacity for this book. Or maybe it's just a slog of a book that few regular folks would find appealing.", "3.5 *", "One of 5 volumes of geology with a personal twist that McPhee has written. I have not read McPhee in so long - glad to get back to him. This is the story of the geology of Wyoming - and a fascinating story it is! McPhee gives it that personal note by telling us the story of the Love family and traveling w/ geologist David Love. His mother was a Wellesley grad who came to WY to teach in a one room schoolhouse, and was wooed by cowboy John Love. The journals of his mother, Ethel Waxman Love, have since been published, and parts were used for Ken Burns' PBS documentary \"The West\". For the most part the geology (helps to know your periods, but a graph of them is included in the book) easily holds your interest, but about 2/3rd's of the way through there is a pretty dry patch of about 30 pages that is rough going. Part of the problem is that it is less about WY and more about the over-all geology of the world. Published in 1986, the changing ecology brought about by the removal of coal, shale, oil, and uranium is already an issue. Even more so today as WY and western ND are booming energy economies (including wind now).The nice mix of the Love family's story and the geology of 100's of billions of years of the area grabbed me from the get go. Also, it has made the 4 hour drive via I-25 from Denver to Casper, WY and back to see the lady friend more interesting. I now know what it is I am looking at, and notice the different layers in the road cuts.Highly recommended. His \"Basin and Range\" is up next for me.", "I love John McPhee's writing, especially when he is describing people and places. Toward the end of this book, the in-depth description of the chaotic geologic layers of Wyoming basins and ranges left me leafing through pages rather than reading them. So truth is I am not a geologist but love to scuttle around the edges of geologic formations. I did recommend that my Wyoming son read this book.", "I read this as we travelled up from Scottsdale through Flagstaff, by the Grand Canyon (we did stop to gawk), through Monument Valley and the Valley of the Gods, over the pass at Butte as it snowed (roads to Yellowstone were closed because of snow), and I finished it today as we drove around the edges of the Black Hills (Theodore Roosevelt National Park). A perfect read for a rather glorious car trip."], "The Control of Nature": ["If you asked me a week ago, or before I read this book, if I thought this would be a five star book I would have thought you were crazy. Her? This book? I would have probably told you I might never even read this book and that it made me bored to just read the copy on the back. And I can't even tell you why I started to read this. I was just sitting around my apartment, reading \nLadies and Gentlemen, The Bible!\n, and I had about thirty pages left and I got restless and it was still light out, actually it was about 7 pm, and it's summer so that meant I still had an hour or so of light, and it was nicer outside than it was in my stuffy apartment so I decided to go outside and read, but I got afraid that I'd zip through the not-so-hilarious re-tellings of bible stories and after standing in the middle of my apartment looking in every direction trying to figure out which book to read next, I just grabbed this one, I don't know why, partly because it was on one of my little cardboard shelves and it was easy to see from where I was standing and I thought I'm not going to care too much about this, I'll be able to give it away when I'm done! And it's only 272 pages long, with sort of big print! Let's go read  about the control of nature. But I was so young and foolish and stupid then, a week ago, last Sunday. This book is so good! I can't do any justice to the book by trying to explain what it is about. If you goto this edition of the book you can read a fairly good description of what the book is about: here!The easy response to just about any of the three stories that make up the basis for these essays (Man Versus The Mississippi River and it's natural inclination to 'move' to a more efficient route to the Gulf of Mexico and it's propensity to flood places like New Orleans, which is just asking for it; Man Versus slow moving lava and mountain (a fucking mountain, a moving fucking mountain on lava. And not an existing mountain, but a new mountain that didn't already exist, how awesome / twisted / mind bending is that? A big fissure opens in the ground, lava starts seeping out, big fire shit shoots into the sky some other geological stuff happens and from the side of a mountain comes another mountain that is moving and some guys with water pumps are trying to stop it) that are threatening to destroy a harbor on an Icelandic Island; and Man Versus millions of tons of rocks and boulders that come sliding off of mountains on the edge of Los Angeles when the conditions are right and destroy everything in their path), as I was saying, the easy response to these is 'well that's what you get for building / living there. But of course, like just about everything in life, when you start to find out more about the situation the easy response isn't so easy. Yeah, people don't need to have million dollar homes on the edge of mountains just waiting for the right combination of wildfire debris, big rains and loose ground from the very active mountains that are still in the process of rising to send rock slides, which can easily pull an automobile along with it, heading towards the expensive homes (and then these people, have the gall to try to sue for property damage they suffer, and sometimes apparently they even win (but sometimes rationality prevails and they don't and they are told, well you knew the risks)), but what do you do now that they are living there? And that they are living there and they are quite possibly extremely litigious? And then what do you think of the situation when you find out it's not just rich idiots living in those homes, but also pretty much the entire geology department of Cal Tech lives in this danger zone, the people who study what is going on here, and who know all of the dangers better than probably anyone else in the world, and they chose to live there. Can you imagine how great the area must be to knowingly risk having your home wiped out in seconds by raging rocks? My favorite part of the book was the Volcano essay that made up the center of the book. It was just amazing, and it didn't even need to rely on some of the silliness that Americans provide with their 'I'm going to sue you!' mentality that the very excellent \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" essay had going on it (it was very very good besides some of the silly stories). I don't know who is reading this right now, but you should read this essay, it's called \"Cooling the Lava\" and I can't put into words how great I thought it was. I'm sort of a bit in love with volcanos after reading it. I'll even cut this review short so that you can go find a copy of this book, or the essay and read it, and hopefully you wont think I steered you too wrong. The rest of this review would have just been gushing about how much I loved the book, or me saying something like \"why are people in Los Angeles so dumb?!?\", now go away and read the essay.", "McFee looks at three huge public works project, the damning and redirectioning of the Mississippi via ongoing construction, primarily by the Army Corps of Engineers; attempts in Iceland to redirect the flow of large volumes of lava away from a town by spraying massive amounts of water at the flow edges; and coping with massive debris flows in Los Angeles, as the San Gabriel mountains that abut the city both rise and crumble.Information here includes some history of the US Army Corps of Engineers, an enlightening look at the history of flooding in New Orleans, an appreciation for the significance of the Atchafalaya, and a look at the geology and natural processes in effect in Los Angeles.Overall, the information presented in The Control of Nature is very interesting. Considering that it was published in 1989, and that I was unaware of the specifics involved, it has clearly not become common knowledge, and thus retains a bit of freshness. It might be nice to see a follow-up by the author, particularly as applied to the Mississippi and Los Angeles issues, in light of events since publication. I confess that I did not look for such, and it may well be out there. While the information in the book was interesting, it seemed to me that the writing was less so. McPhee offers a host of local personalities to illustrate the impact of these issues on people, and generically that approach is sound. Yet, the impact of that approach was minimal. I never felt that his portrayals went beyond what one might find in newspaper reportage of the day. One need not make characters come alive as a good novelist might, but his portrayals rarely rose above the mundane.I thought the book would have profited from the inclusion of illustrations. There is a brief section in which drawings are shown of structures no longer present in Iceland, but they added little.", "Although these three extended essays all ran in the NEW YORKER magazine nearly 30 years ago, they retain the power to educate, amuse, and shock, and all show John McPhee, master of nonfiction, at his best. \"Atchafalaya\" details the growth of the still little-known waterway that runs roughly parallel to the Mississippi and -- here's the real shock -- might someday \"seize\" the mainstream of the mighty Mississip', leaving towns like Baton Rouge and New Orleans high and dry, without outlet. To mitigate against this, the Army Corps of Engineers has built several huge water exchangers that connect the two rivers under the theory that regulating the flow of Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya may forestall grand theft by the latter. As always, McPhee interviews just the right officials and employees at just the right time, and his descriptive similes are jewels: the spillway that transmits Mississippi water into the Atchafalaya goes \"sideways, like grain squirting out of a burlap bag.\" What do you do when red-hot lava from new or recent volcanoes threatens the nearest towns and cities? In Iceland, you pump literally millions of gallons of cold seawater on the magma, hoping it will stall into solid basalt and (eventually) stop the flow. In Hawaii, you try channelling, playing a dangerous game of curling to make the killer lava go somewhere slightly different than it had intended. This section is called \"Cooling the Lava\" and it is absolutely enthralling, as are the rugged academics, military folk and plain old citizens McPhee encounters in both places. The third section shows the full power of civilization, bureaucracy and high technology against the San Gabriel Mountains -- in other words \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\" -- and in spite of millions upon millions spent for retaining walls, dry reservoirs to catch rain-loosed mud and dislodged bolders, it remains to be seen who will eventually win. Why, oh why, do people insist on nesting just below these flaky mountains? One reason is to get above the smog zone, making it something that can be seen but not breathed: Recalling that Southern California smog has its origin in natural sea fog: As you watch it from above through the morning and into the afternoon,  it turns yellow, then ochre, then brown, and sometimes nearly black --  like butter darkening in a skillet.  Verbally, McPhee is also no stranger to humor; lest I introduce spoilers I won't detail the jibes he gets off at one suburban Arby's, but watch out for them!All three segments, and therefore all of The Control of Nature, come highly recommended.", "John McPhee is one of the greatest writers in America today, and this is a wonderful introduction to his work. The premise - humans constantly challenge nature, and may hold the upper hand for a while. But nature never gets tired, and can beat our best in the end. Moral - trying to control nature is risky business, and sometimes a very bad idea.", "A great way to ponder the arrogance of humankind", "John McPhee is an inspired observer, outdoorsman and a writer with ultimate mastery of the English language. This is an extract from the jacket. \"The Control of Nature is John McPhee's bestselling account of places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature. In Louisiana, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has declared war on the lower Mississippi River, which threatens to follow a new route to the sea and cut off New Orleans and Baton Rouge from the rest of the United States. Icelanders confront flowing red lava in an attempt to save a crucial harbor. In Los Angeles, basins are built to catch devastating debris flows from the San Gabriel Mountains.Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking is his depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those attempting to wrest control from her stubborn, sometimes foolhardy, more often ingenious, and always arresting characters.\"John's books frequently appear serialized in the New Yorker. Over the years I've read all of his 29 books. Many of his books like 'Basin to Range' are slow, many would consider them dull\" because they're primarily about geology. But individually and collectively they're my favorite books and I reread them on a regular basis.They're intensely interesting: 'Coming into the Country' is a collection of stories about the people of Alaska (way pre Sarah Palin), Informative to a fault: 'Oranges'and wonderfully absorbing, his newest, 'Uncommon Carriers'.  'Uncommon Carriers': Again an overview: \"Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent considerable time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. Uncommon Carriers is his sketchbook of them and of his journeys with them. He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of theFrench Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the \u201ctight-assed\u201d Illinois River on a \u201ctowboat\u201d pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being \u201ca good deal longer than the Titanic.\u201d And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839.Uncommon Carriers is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author\u2019s warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character.\" I enjoyed this book so much that I tried to read just a few pages a day to make it last, reading other books the rest of the timeHis little book, 'the making of a bark canoe' is classic McPhee. Full of painstaking detail about one young man's obsession with making authentic bark canoes, with simple tools, and canoeing trips with him to test them.John McPhee is an avid outdoorsman. It permeates his books.His books grown on one, become old friends and companions in life. A calm accurate, enthralling and literate observer of the worlds he discovers for the rest of us. Perhaps the best counter to too much fast and electronic information that I know of in out interactive, online, plugged in world, which I love also.", "This book is about people living in places where nature is in a state of constant change, and the extraordinary lengths they go to try to control the ultimately uncontrollable forces. It would be funny if it was fiction. A sheriff survives the inundation of his neighborhood by a massive debris slug only because it tosses him into the back of a pickup truck being carried along in the mud and boulders along with parts of houses. The absurdity of many of the eco-meets-ego situations reaches the Carl Hiaasen level, except these stories don\u2019t take place in Florida. And they are real. Written in 1989, Control of Nature analyzes the economic, social and geological forces behind three man-vs.-nature struggles: the attempt to force the Mississippi River to behave in the way that permanently settled human communities want it to, and not to change course when it naturally would have done so; the fight to cool a lava flow in Iceland and save a fishing harbor; and the most absurd of all somehow, Los Angeles Against the Mountains, the persistence of people living in the eroding and also rising San Gabriels, where the combination of tectonic forces lifting the mountains and erosion and fire on their slopes leads to a constant flow of rocks toward LA. Big ones. Tons of them. The most depressing section was about the Mississippi. Hurricane Katrina made it all too clear how vulnerable people are when they live in places where only many man-made interventions have enabled them to be there\u2014where it would be an entirely different ecosystem and landscape if left alone.As we know from the story of post-Katrina New Orleans, some people go back, though lot of people didn\u2019t. On the island in Iceland where the volcano erupted, a lot of people didn\u2019t go back, either, but many did. McPhee does a good job of getting the points of view of the people who choose the risk. Some people have no choice\u2014they were born in a threatened place and don\u2019t have the means to move, but others build or buy expensive homes on the slopes of unstable mountains. He finds experts on the geology of the San Gabriels who consciously live right in the path of potential debris flows, as well as real estate agents who blithely talk their way around the risk, reassuring potential buyers more than they ought to be reassured. McPhee\u2019s interest in the human beings involved as well as the earth makes him a great story-teller. A little distractible, a little inclined to collect as many anecdotes as possible, but never dull. He can make alarming and complex scientific material readable without making it any less alarming. The issues are not old. I did a little research before writing this review. People studying the Old River Control structure where the Atchafalaya is being\u2014for now\u2014prevented from capturing the Mississippi still say McPhee\u2019s article that was the basis for this book is the best thing ever written on the topic. Debris flows are still endangering California towns. People still live where nature could cover them up with water, lava or rocks on short notice, and they love those places or need them economically. Taxes pay for the structures that make it possible for them to be there, and for the recovery when disaster strikes. Decide what you think about that, after you read this book.", "This book is a compilation of three extended essays that originally appeared in The New Yorker. In each of them McPhee examines a colossal problem, the grand engineering \"solution,\" and the ongoing fall-out from the very human choices we make.\"Atchafalaya\" deals with the attempt to control the flow of the Mississippi River in order to keep the majority of the stream moving through New Orleans. If left alone, the larger part would by now have diverted naturally, flowing through the Atchafalaya River to the Gulf of Mexico, shortening the river's route to the Gulf, but destroying the economy of South Louisiana in the process. As this was written about 20 years ago, the modern reader cannot help but consider what has happened to New Orleans in light of Hurricane Katrina, and see the numerous warning signs that everyone has been aware of for decades.The second tale is of Heimaney, an island off the coast of Iceland, where a volcanic eruption threatened the best harbor for fishermen in the south of the country. By earnestly pumping water onto the lava, people were able to influence the flows and save much of the harbor. The town survived, battered and uneasy in the shadow of a brand new volcanic mountain.In \"Los Angeles Against the Mountains,\" McPhee provides an account of the debris flows that threaten much of the metropolitan area's hills through the natural cycles of fire and flood. It is clear that the man-made \"solutions\" and continued land development have created situations where debris flows can be much more hazardous. It is also clear that, even among those who should know better, the lure of living above the smog is nearly irresistible. This would be an excellent book for a discussion group composed of engineering students. It also should be required reading for civic leaders. The author makes clear that more intelligently planned development requires a better understanding of the competition between the land and its natural systems and the desires of humans. It is also clear that the economic and human costs of ignoring Mother Nature continue to plague our societies.", "His description of the larger ecosystem is very prescient. It was particularly chilling to read his description of the levee system in New Orleans before the Katrina Hurricane and see how precarious our engineering systems are. It has only strenghtened my belief that we put way too much faith in technological solutions to forces that humans cannot control. It is a humbling book, and good reminder that all actions have much larger reverberations than we often acknowledge.", "The effort involved in moving a powerful river, steering a volcanic eruption, or challenging gravity's hold on a mountain is clearly documented and described by McPhee's engaging - albeit dry - narrative. This is a fun book to read if only to get a sense of what huge projects people will embark on to protect their way of life. It's a shame that the projects are ultimately useless because the scale that nature operates on simply dwarfs what civil engineering can handle. Read this book if you'd like to see what living on the edge is like in such exotic locations as Louisiana and Los Angeles (what!).I thought this book was quite fascinating - the two U.S. locations that were explored were quite eye opening. I thought I was pretty well aware of what's going on nationally, but some things just slip past. The story about the islands off the coast of Iceland was also nice, McPhee gave a good description of the mentality of Icelanders. Collectively, I think the three stories paint a diverse picture of peoples' attempts to \"improve\" their surroundings for material gain, but they're lacking something.As I read this book, it became very evident that they have been published serially (in the New Yorker) and the three sections of the book were not really tied together in any direct way (besides the obvious thematic connection). It just struck me as a somewhat lazy thing to do after putting together all the research on each of the individual bits. That aspect doesn't take away from the purpose of the book, but it's a missed opportunity to add more analysis for readers who have missed the original publications. Speaking of analysis, if you're looking for a strong opinion on the various projects that are discussed, you'll have to look somewhere beyond this book. This is not exactly a detraction: McPhee provided a fair amount of evidence to describe each of the projects and the effect on the relevant communities. You can make up your own mind on the value of the engineering efforts, and will have a good starting point if you'd like to go deeper in any of these areas. That said, simply by writing these books McPhee expressed his own opinion on the apparent follies awaiting nature to take its course.As you may have gathered by now, this review has purposefully skirted the actual contents of the book. This is not because there's nothing to discuss, but rather the story is better told by McPhee than me. It's an entertaining book that delivers exactly what I expected from the title and cover. Could it have done more? Sure. Was it worth going through? I think so."], "Harry Potter Collection (Harry Potter, #1-6)": ["I do not own this spiffy box set of Harry Potter books, but no way was I going to sit down and input all 6 of them!! When we were in the UK on our honeymoon in the spring of 2000, Harry Potter fever was just hitting its stride there. Not long after that the books found their way to Canada and I fell in love with this series right from the first book. Again (I'm a broken record) great characters and time-old literary themes, as well as just being a very enjoyable read. I haven't gone to see the movies, because I don't want the characters in my mind replaced with British teen actors and Gary Oldman. (can't stand Gary Oldman.) Fantastic read for any age. Some of my all-time favourite literary characters are from this series, like Dumbledore and Sirius Black. The books get heavier (literally and metaphorically) as the series progresses. The first book is the most child-like, shorter and lighter fare. The last book is downright philosophical and practically qualifies as a doorstop it's so weighty. The HP series is kind of like literary comfort food around here, if there's nothing else to read we'll just grab one and dive in. A definite must-read!", "I loved these books. I never got into them at the same time the world went into its \"Harry Potter Rage\", but I couldn't help but give then a once over before I judged those people. They were right, in the end. The author gives us a parallel world where, once again, you can't help but hope it is as real as you or me. Set mostly in a school that, dare I say, every person who read the books wished their parents had sent them when they were little, the story seems to captivate with mysterious spells, strange people, and all around \"what happens next!?-ness). The main cast is made up of 3 characters who bounce information, hilarity, and small jabs of honesty and cruelty at each other. What makes it more interesting is the fact that these kids go to school while doing the exact things that could get them kicked out in order to progress the story. I am not a Harry Potter fanatic, however. I do not wear \"Muggle\" shirts or have a wand. And yet, the depth of the story is very obliging to what I really wanted in a book. For a small while, it made me a child again. You will not regret this read.", "Great books-(and number 7!) I would only say that the plot is very similar to The Lord of the Rings( the ring has to be destroyed, so do the horcruxes ), as are some of the characters:Gimli ----> hagridDumbledore ----> gandalfAnyway, they are excellent books, very inspirational. A new world has been created!", "Harry Potter is regarderd as one of the best and most influential pieces of fiction ever to be written. I have no choice but to agree. This series sparked my love for reading and fantasy, which I am every grateful for. A review of content and themes is completely unnecessary, as virtually the entire population of the United States of America is knowledgeable of that content. However, I will say one thing: if you do not read Harry Potter in your lifetime, then you have failed as a reader. I recommend this series to everyone.", "AMAZING!", "How good is this book? SO good I've read the whole series about 7 times! :) I love J.K. Rowling.", "I listened to all them as audiobooks! I was sorry I had waited so long to \"read\" them at all.", "Absolutely loved this story and these characters. My favorite was Goblet of Fire.", "This book is god's gift to readers !!! i dont need to write a review about this book for ppl to know about its greatness ....CLOSING STATEMENT :HARRY POTTER ROX !!!!", "The book is the bomb"], "The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)": ["I refuse to write a review for one of the best books ever written. Asking a serious fantasy fan to write a review for Lord of the Rings is like asking a Christian to write a review for The Bible. So instead I will supply you with this graph:", "Never have I been so sad to give a low rating to such a revered book. I'm so sorry. I can't tell you how sorry I am.Again, I'm so sorry, but I found this book unbelievably dull. I really am so, so sorry. I'm desperately sad about this. This series has been such a foundation for modern-day fantasy that I'm incredibly disappointed in myself for not liking this. I have always wanted to be a Tolkien fangirl. I've always wanted to learn Elvish and get completely offended \u00e0 la Stephen Colbert but I can't. I just can't. I want so desperately to love Tolkien, but it just ain't happening. I've been trying this book for 17 years. Tolkien and I have a sad history. I've always been a book lover, when I was young, I would persist through any book, no matter how trying. The Hobbit was the first book that made me fall asleep. It's memorable to me because that's the first time, and only the second time it's ever happened. The other book that made me fall asleep? You guessed it. The Fellowship of the Ring. I tried The Fellowship in 10th grade. I couldn't get past Bilbo's birthday party. I tried it again almost 10 years ago when I was stuck in bed for several days due to, oh, a giant surgical wound in my neck. My doctor said I had to stay in bed for a few days. So, I reasoned, what better way than to resume my attempt at reading one of the greatest literary classics of all time than whole having no other option?Audiobook it was! I didn't last past Tom Bombadil before I decided, fuck this, I'm going to head to the gym with a bloody bandage on my neck. True story. I got a lot of really weird looks. My doctor gave me a prescription for Vicodin because he was concerned the pain would be too much to bear. Apparently, I didn't even need the Vicodin because that pedophile Tom Bombadil put me right to sleep.Seriously, were it not for the fact that it is written by Tolkien, I would have hated this book. It was so unbelievably dull. There were parts, that to a Tolkien amateur like me, didn't have a whit of relevance or anything interesting to add to the plot (namely, say, the first 700 pages of the book). Seriously, what the fuck is up with the farmer and Tom Bombadil?The plot was all sorts of disjointed. Some parts just didn't make any sense. Tolkien is a linguist at heart, and it shows, because all the famous quotes we know from him are just sound bytes. In context, sometimes they don't really make any sense. All the poems and songs are in there to sound pretty, and frankly, they bored the fuck out of me.For instance, in the middle of a serious dinner party where the company is just trying to decide what to do about the ring (surely a simple task), all of a sudden little Frodo stands up and solemnly announces.\nAll that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king\nI was like what the fuck, man?! Where did that come from? It makes absolutely no sense in the context of the scene. Oh, sure, it's an inside thing on how Aragorn was the secret king, but nobody knew that! Everyone, elf, hobbit, dwarf, (and me) would have thought he was completely high on some elven grass.Let me make this clear: I do not, for an instance, doubt Tolkien's literary value. I think he has been an inspiration to generations of writers, artists, hell, gamers. My beloved World of Warcraft game featured elves, pretty much every fantasy book we have these days have been inspired in one way or another by Tolkien. Again, he was an amazing linguist, his work developing the Elvish tongue, among others, as well as his efforts in developing the rich, fantastic history of the world within his books is not to be disregarded by any means.But again, he is a linguist. He is a scholar. He may be the most brilliant one of those in the world, an inspiration to generations, but for me, personally, his writing is not to my tastes.But damn, the movies were amazing!", "Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's \nThe Broken Sword\n, which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or C.S. Lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's Goodkind's Libertarianism or John Norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'Merrie England', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he\u2019s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien\u2019s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It\u2019s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it\u2019s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that\u2019s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien\u2019s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the \u2018depth of its world building\u2019, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero\u2019s cuirass, we'll forget that he\u2019s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should \u2018murder their darlings\u2019, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien\u2019s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock\u2019s \nEpic Pooh\n and Mieville\u2019s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn\u2019t some special author, some \u2018fantasy granddad\u2019 looming over all. He\u2019s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren\u2019t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien\u2019s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.My Fantasy Book Suggestions", "No words need be said. (Whoever made this gif should be knighted).", "A review of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, by SauronHello. You may remember me as the title character of the Lord of Rings. I go by a lot of names: Dark Lord of Mordor, Sorcerer, Red Eye, Dark Power, Lord of Barad-d\u00fbr, Ring-maker and Base Master of Treachery (I use that one in my band). I actually object to Tolkien's chosen name of Sauron, which I understand originates from an adjective that means \"foul, putrid\" in his crappy invented language. What can I say, the showers in Mordor are sketchy at best. On weekends, my poker buddies call me Sauron the Destroyer of Nacho Platters. Because Tolkien intentionally failed to give a proper description of me in his books, allow me to give you an idea. I have a bit of a dark look. My quest for world domination having been thwarted, I watch a lot of TV these days. My body is roughly equivalent to the \"The Situation\" on Jersey Shore. Oh, no I don't watch that, but the Witch-king of Angmar is obsessed. He won't shut up about Snowcone or some bimbo on that show. I'm missing a finger, which while preventing me from raining down carnage on Middle Earth, allows me to collect decent EI. Plus the best lawyer in Mordor got me covered under the dismemberment clause on my insurance, so I'm riding the double dip gravy train. Much has been written about my terrible Lidless Red Eye, blah blah blah. It freaked out that little twat Frodo pretty good. I'll have you know that conjunctivitis is no laughing matter. Having to keep it open 24/7 to look for hoodlums skulking around Mordor is murder on my hydration. The Nazgul have enough lift and aim to get up there to toss a bucket of Visine at it, but it's just temporary relief. Regardless, I'm still more of a looker than your precious King Elessar or Aragorn or whatever he's calling himself these days. He's never met a brooding look he didn't like. Buy a razor. Get a real job.Someone sent me Peter Jackson's movies in the mail. The package had no return address but it was postmarked \"Hobbiton\", where ever the hell that is. As I watch these movies over and over (I never even finished the books) I was reminded of all my mistakes...Perhaps a ring was not a good choice. Some buddies have suggested that maybe I shouldn't have tied all of my terrible powers to something as easy to misplace as the One Ring. In retrospect, I should have forged The One Gas Station Bathroom Key Chain of Power. It would have been a lot harder to tief. I even could have pimped it out by making it from an Ent branch or Saruman's foot, for all the good that old fart did me. Maybe a ring would have been just fine if it had been a toe ring. Then it wouldn't glow in the dark like a target for every freaking Man on the battlefield. I heard that the guy who beat me was named \"Isildur\"!!?? WTF. Maybe I could have worn tougher gloves, I don't know. Perhaps the door to the Fires of Mount Doom should have had a better lock. ADT could have hooked me up with motion detectors but I hear that even cats can set those off. They claim they can calibrate them but I'm not so sure. The Uruk-hai are always jumping up on the table, so they would set it off for sure. Maybe just the alarm that goes off if something hits the lava, like pool alarms for kid. Although I guess it would have been too late by then. \"My preccciioouussss!\". Learn some balance a-hole.Frodo. That little prick. I'd rather not discuss how my quest for utter dominion was defeated by something I could poop out unnoticed.I'm getting off track. I'm supposed to discuss the events of the first book, the Fellowship of the Ring. Good times! I was on a comeback! Then the withered up senior citizen Gandalf had to go to the library and do a little research and figure out that my Ring was not some cracker jack prize. My Ringwraiths tried to track down the Ring but apparently taking it away from children was too difficult. If I had put the Nazg\u00fbl on fell beasts rather than bloody horses from the start I might have tracked down Frodo (prick) and his three buddies in the bloody woods. Don't horses have a good sense of smell!? Anyways, the fell beasts would have at least avoided drowning in a river. Sweet Mary. Then those Elves suggest a damn \"fellowship\". Could you have come up with a lamer group name?? Why not call it the \"Loose Association of People Who Share Common Beliefs or Activities\u2026of the Ring\". That Balrog almost did me the biggest favour, he was always one of my peeps. \"You shall not pass!!\" What a line Gandy! How cow. I heard that one took like 15 takes because Pippin kept making everyone laugh by adding in the word \"gas\". Fool of a Took!Anyways, by the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, I still had a fighting chance. Great book. Anyways, The Two Towers won't be as fun to review. Sh*t hits the fan. (A note from Sauron's agent: full credit for the idea of this review goes to Kemper and his awesome review of Drood)", "As a single lady myself, I also love to put a ring on it. And shoutout to my homegurl Sauron!!! you go girl take over middle earth! Reach for the stars! With that balrog on your side you can do anything!That main dude Frodo tho... reminds me of dat boi Harry... besides what does he need the ring for??Anyways I gotta give it a low rating cuz theres 2 much frodo, not enough orcs", "I wasn't really \"cool\" back in high school. I never made out with girls under the bleachers, or smoked under the bleachers, or did any of the other things under the bleachers that - I am lead to believe - the popular kids did. Instead, I maintained a low profile and waited for the teenage years - that wilderness of strangled thinking - to end.In high school, as today, I harbored geekish obsessions, had a wandering imagination, and nurtured an appreciation for minutiate. In other words, I should have been J.R.R. Tolkien's core audience. For whatever reason - perhaps intuition that I didn't need to dig my social hole any deeper - I never read The Lord of the Rings when most people first come upon The Lord of the Rings. Actually, I was barely cognizant of LOTR until college, when the movies were released. I absolutely loved Peter Jackson's film trilogy. During law school, I left a legal writing final halfway through in order to see Return of the King on opening day. Despite this, I never desired to read the source material. From talking to my friends, who were Tolkien enthusiasts (\"nerds\"), I assumed I wouldn't like the books. They seemed too talky, dense, and plodding. Finally, one fair summer night on my patio, my friend Jon and I were drinking beer and talking about The Lord of the Rings and how it was funny we could do this openly and still have significant others of the opposite sex. (I believe my wife was inside at the time, deciding what she would take in the divorce). Somehow, in a Miller Light and bratwurst haze, Jon got me to commit to giving LOTR a try. Then, I did a keg stand with Jon's homemade beer. This is how I read. Now, having finished Fellowship of the Ring, I have new appreciation for what Peter Jackson accomplished. Yeah, he made it into an action film, but that's the medium of film; there needs to be action. He did a fine job of taking Tolkien's essence and goosing it. (Sometimes he goosed the action too much, but we can discuss Legolas surfing on his shield at Helm's Deep another day). It was this love of the film that, interestingly, made me hesitant to read the books. Folks who love Tolkien love Tolkien with a vengeance. If it isn't obvious already, I don't have that underlying feeling. I understand, theoretically, Tolkien's achievement, but I'm not going to pretend to know all the references - religious, mythic, and linguistic - used as ingredients. What I do know is that, at its heart, LOTR is an archetypal hero's journey. It begins with an orphan of average abilities, who has a task thrust upon him. This forces the hero to leave home and enter the wider world. In the world he must pass tests, learn lessons, and eventually accomplish his task. Once that is done, the hero can return home; however, he is forever changed, and the home to which he returns is different.The hero in LOTR is Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. Now, a hobbit is - well, they're short, but they're not dwarves. That's the important thing to remember. Hobbits are like pot-smoking liberal arts majors. They like to hang around, eat, smoke, drink, and talk. Frodo's uncle, Bilbo, is a rare hobbit who has gone out and had adventures. He also has a magic ring, which he gives to Frodo. This ring...well it's evil. I could explain more, and Tolkien certainly does, but suffice it to say the ring is a Macguffin. It's like Marcellus Wallace's suitcase in Pulp Fiction: it drives the plot, and that's all you need to know. (This being Tolkien, though, you are certainly able to learn much, much, much more). Bilbo and Frodo's friend, the wizard Gandalf, tells Frodo that he must take the ring to the Cracks of Doom to destroy it, lest the Dark Shadow Sauron get his figurative hands upon it. With this, the journey starts. Frodo is joined by three other hobbits: Sam (the loyal one); Pippin (the scared one); and Merry (the one portrayed by Lost's Dominic Monaghan). After some brushes with the Nine Riders/the Nazgul/the Ring Wraiths (Tolkien has a very Russian way of making up a name, and then making up two or three or four synonyms, which makes things a little confusing), the hobbits meet up with Aragorn/Strider who leads them to Rivendell, where the elves live under Elrond. There is a counsel, the Fellowship is joined by Boromir (a man), Legolas (an elf) and Gimli (a dwarf). It all sounds like the set-up for a very complicated joke. But rest assured, the fate of Middle-Earth is at stake. (Though that does not stop the characters from stopping repeatedly for long meals; apparently, the Fellowship is comprised of foodies and gourmands). It's important to note what this book is not: it is not an action-packed adventure. Mostly, it is people walking through this make-believe world, talking about the past, and worrying about the future. There is a battle in the mountains of Moria that lasts for two pages; other than that, there are only scattered paragraphs when people are running, swords are unsheathed, and the stakes are raised. If swords and arrows are what you seek, just stick to the films. Moreover, you aren't going to find complex characterizations. The good guys are varing shades of good, and the bad guys are really bad. About the only conflicted characters are Boromir, who is conflicted for five sentences or so, and Gollum, the strung-out ring-addict. So what is the book? Well, it's a place you visit. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a Nyquill connoisseur (or addict, take your pick). I often need something to calm my overactive mind before I can get to sleep. Instead of the Quill, for the past weeks, I used Fellowship. This is a compliment. Tolkien's world is so immersive, so fully realized - with its varied races, songs, languages, and lore - that whenever you open the covers it's a sublime escape. You are in an ancient land filled with a rich and ancient history, and a wonderfully described topography. Sure, the shadow of war hangs over Middle-Earth, but there is no tension. If you feel like Frodo is in mortal danger, and might not accomplish his task, you're probably six years old and having the story read aloud. Reading Fellowship was simply comforting. I wouldn't mind a kindly wizard giving me sage advice: Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.And I also wouldn't mind going on a little hike through the forest, and maybe hanging out with some elves:Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves burst into song. Suddenly, under teh trees a fire sprang with light. 'Come!' the Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come! Now is the time for speech and merriment!'...At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the greenfloor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on heaped plates and dishes.Frodo's journey is secondary to Tolkien's creation of Middle-Earth. And the genius of Middle-Earth is that it goes beyond the pages. With its allusions to a long history filled with famous leaders and famous events and famous battles, your imagination is ignited. Upon finishing the first book, I saw how LOTR became a place of refuge for the outcasts and iconoclasts of our world. Like comic books, it is a place of escape, where the everyday order is turned upside down: the stakes are high, the heroes short, the beer is plentiful, and girls a distant afterthought.", "I\u2019m not going to write a normal review; it\u2019s almost impossible for a fantasy fan to do so in this case. Instead I\u2019m going to give you a series of ten points to explain exactly why I love this particular book. Take from it what you will. There will be spoilers. Here goes:  1. The wizards! \"\u201cDo not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.\u201d Now I do love wizards. Who doesn\u2019t? The wisdom of Gandalf is unmatched. He is, in effect, the leader of the forces of light. He is the commander in chief, the battle general and the tactician. He organises everything. From Aragorn\u2019s coming, to the hobbits bearing the ring, Gandalf is behind it all. He has walked middle earth for thousands of years. He has seen it all. And he understands the perilous nature of the quest better than most. He is the grand optimist, the man who sees the best in people. He should have been the leader of the Isatri. He was the most pure. He is nothing like the changeable leader of his order. Contrastingly, Saruman is the realist. He is neither light nor dark, but a being who can adapt to the circumstance. He saw only defeat for man, so he turned his cloak and helped to usher in the doom of middle earth. His mind was poisoned by the palantir, Sauron fed of his ambition and bent him to his will. Something Saruman didn\u2019t fully conceive. He considered himself the equal of Sauron. In reality, if Sauron had regained the ring, he would have crushed Saruman like a bug. And if Saruman had gained the ring first, things would have become much different. It would have been a war between the two, one that would have unforeseen circumstances. 2. A desperate quest The quest itself, the sending of just nine people to destroy the conduit of darkness, speaks of desperation. The elves are not what they once were in the first age. Their power has diminished: their people are leaving these lands. They do not have the power to stand against the tide. The Dwarves are shattered and broken. Their leadership in Erabor has their own problems to deal with. They, too, face invasion. And men, men, are weak. Well at least according to Elrond. So sending of a small party of mighty heroes, and a few untested hobbits, is a back door attempt of destroying the evil that infests middle earth. And I love it. Have you ever read about a quest so unlikely and so improbable? \u201cI will take the Ring\", he said, \"though I do not know the way.\u201d 3. A Hidden KingOther than the obvious wizard, the agile elvish prince, the stalwart dwarf lord, the fellowship has a secret weapon. Aragorn, the heir to Isildur, has finally come forth. \u201cAll that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.\u201dHe alone has the power to unite the failing world of men. Only he can save the white tree of Gondor and insure that men do not fall into darkness. And the darkness, it genuinely fears him. He is the last hope of men: he is their salvation. His ancient ancestor Isildur struck the ring from the hand of evil; thus, Sauron fears his coming. However, he is more powerful than Isildur. He has lived amongst the elves, and he has learnt how his ancestor failed to crush the darkness in his vain weakness. Aragorn will not make the same mistake. He will do better. 4.Loyalty The party itself, the Fellowship of the Ring, are bound together with a mutual goal. But it\u2019s more than that; they are dependent on each other. Each has skills the others could never possess. And each brings with him the hope of a people. Simply put, these heroes cannot fail. Middle earth depends on them. They are the best of their races, the most representative of their cultures, and their participation speaks of a will to conquer the shadow that approaches. It speaks of commitment. 5.Finding your courageNot all the party have been fully tested. With them travel four young hobbits, the most unlikely of companions for such a journey. They are the overlooked, the forgotten about, the race that is casually discarded and considered insignificant in the wider world. And perhaps this has been the downfall of society in middle earth previously. The forces of darkness exploit everything they can get their hands on, from giant spiders to rampaging trolls, from dragons to orcs, from men of the east to the undead, Sauron tries to wield it all. This is something the forces of good have not fully considered until recently. Within the bosom of the hobbit beats a strong heart of fortitude and resilience. \u201cMy dear Frodo!\u2019 exclaimed Gandalf. \u2018Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.\u201d They carry with them the key to destroying the dark. Bilbo showed them how he could resist the ring. The hobbits are an almost incorruptible race, and because of this they are Sauron\u2019s doom. It is something he has overlooked. \u201cIt would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,\" said Frodo, \"and I could not have borne that.\"\"Not as certain as being left behind,\" said Sam.\"But I am going to Mordor.\"\"I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you.\u201d 6.The Rich History Middle earth didn\u2019t pop up overnight. This word has been around for thousands of years. Such can be seen from the ruined statues and monuments that dot the landscape, to mentions of historic battles and finally to kings long since departed. This is a world that has seen a lot. This moment in the third age, which is arguable the most important series of events this world will ever see, is merely the surface. Go read  The Silmarillion. Go see how old and beautiful this world is. I could lose myself in Middle-earth. And this book carries with it all the baggage of what came before. It\u2019s extraordinary. 7.The Diverse Languages and RacesAnd with this history comes the language of the people. The elves, the men, the dwarves and Sauron\u2019s creatures of darkness all come with their own developed languages. This isn\u2019t some random phrases stuck in the book, which you may see with other fantasy novels, but actually fully developed languages. They have their own grammatical forms, syntax styles and sound qualities that reflect the speaker. The languages are real. Naturally, the elvish language is a personal favourite of mine: 8.The Power of RedemptionIt is easy to judge Boromir of Gondor. He tried to take the ring from Frodo, though for all his misguidedness, he was trying to do right by his people. He naively believed, due to his farther Denethor, that the ring could be wielded against the evil. So when a young hobbit is trying to destroy his people\u2019s supposed salvation, he strikes.Until that moment he doesn\u2019t fully understand the evil it holds, until his desire for it twists his heart and turns him violent. But, afterwards, after he sees what he has become, his willpower does prevail: he understands. He later dies defending the Fellowship of the Ring, a bloody end, but one that saves his honour. 9. The Forces of Darkness  One evil binds them all. Sauron tried to make himself the ultimate tyrant, and claim dominion over all lands: he wanted to be the de facto ruler of middle earth. He failed. Those that followed his initial claim are forever left in the dark. Their souls are black, their hearts corrupt: their bodies no more. The Nazgul have become the living dead; they are complex figure, driven by hate and a will no longer their own. These men have become something else. Do they wish to rest? I do not know. Do they wish to carry out their master\u2019s work or are they driven by his domination? I do not know. Orcs are mere tools for the darkness, the Nazgul are something much darker. They are the perfect harbingers of their lord. 10. The Elves  The elves are my favourite part of middle earth. I should have been born an elf. I would love to spend a few years in Rivendell, especially in Elrond\u2019s library relaxing by the waterfalls reading the histories of middle earth. Doesn\u2019t that just sound like so much fun? The best thing about reading fantasy like this is the pure escapism it provides, the worse thing is realising how shit the \u201creal world\u201d is in comparison. To quote another fine author of fantasy, and to conclude this review, I will simply repeat these words: \n\n\"They can keep their heaven. When I die, I\u2019d sooner go to middle Earth.\"", "The Journey begins!!!\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF A RING\u2019S STORY\n\nCourage is found in unlikely places.\nWhat started up as an adventure oriented for children turned into an epic fantasy......THE epic fantasy book, anything else in the genre after this, born here, any other author writing in this field, began here, and even impacted in many other genres and formats.Certainly, in The Hobbit, there are dangers, there is death, so thinking about it as a children\u2019s tale is a much debated issue, but it\u2019s clear that Tolkien\u2019s intention was to present a light-hearted adventure. \nEven the smallest person can change the course of the future.\nHowever, due some communication\u2019s troubles between Tolkien and the publishing house, making him to think that they weren\u2019t enjoying the proposed sequel to The Hobbit, the story got bigger, larger, darker......and redefined the conception of epic fantasy in literarure.Even Tolkien needed to re-write the chapter in The Hobbit involving Bilbo, Gollum and the One Ring, since the story known as The Lord of the Rings became something that even the very Tolkien didn\u2019t foreseen before.So, what began as a small hobbit living in a hole that found a tiny ring in his journey, turned into a visceral war involving the whole Middle-Earth.\nMY THEORY ABOUT THE RING\n\n For nothing is evil in the beginning.\nI have a theory about the One Ring. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a spoiler.As I quoted (in this part of the review) Tolkien, may nothing is evil in the beginning, not even Sauron was evil in his own beginning, but......there is one thing in the Middle-Earth that it was evil since its own beginning......the One Ring!The One Ring was evil in its own beginning.The One Ring was in the hand of Sauron, then it passed to Isildur, a man, but it was soon lost and ended in the hands of D\u00e9agol, a hobbit, to fall right away in the possession of Sm\u00e9agol, another hobbit, having it for so many time that Sm\u00e9agol lost his own identity turning to be Gollum, scary, nasty, treacherous and dangerous but still a hobbit, then enter Bilbo, yet another hobbit, and finally gets into the picture, Frodo, yes, another hobbit.Do you see the pattern? (Because to me it wasn\u2019t that hard!)Hobbit, hobbit, hobbit, hobbit.It\u2019s said that people (all kind of people: Elves, Dwarves, Men, etc...) are obsessed with the One Ring.But to me, it\u2019s clear that the One Ring is \u201cobsessed\u201d with the Hobbits!!!Sauron may be the Lord of the Rings, but it has been stated that the One Ring has a mind-like on its own. It\u2019s not like a Green Lantern\u2019s Power Ring able to talk and having a computer-like library to access inside, even the feature to fly on its own to search the next suitable user. The One Ring can\u2019t talk, can\u2019t move or fly on its own, but still is a magic ring alright (or \u201calwrong\u201d since it\u2019s unquestionable wicked (hey! No only Tolkien can invent words!) and it\u2019s clear that its purpose is to bind all people into darkness, into evil.Sauron may have plans for the One Ring, but it\u2019s likely that the One Ring has its own plans, its own designs, not to rebel, not to stand against its master, but to fulfill its basic purpose since it may notice a small flaw in Sauron\u2019s plans.Sauron wants to turn into evil the whole Middle-Earth\u2019s population: Elves are wise and powerful but still they have already fell into darkness in some numbers (no wonder why they\u2019re starting an exodus from the Middle-Earth). Dwarves are greedy and violent, they\u2019re easy targets for darkness. Men? Don\u2019t make me laugh! We are the most susceptible species for darkness of all, nothing to worry about for the One Ring.However, Sauron didn\u2019t even know the existence (for not saying clearly not knowing the location) of the Shire. Therefore, it\u2019s evident that the hobbits aren\u2019t in the plans of Sauron. You can say that it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t know about them or simply because he didn\u2019t consider them worthy to send any troops there.But the One Ring knows. In some way, it knows about the Hobbits.And the One Ring has \nONE\n purpose...\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.\nThe One Ring is thorough about its purpose. It is obsessed about its one single purpose in the Middle-Earth. It has to bind ALL people into darkness, into evil. Not matter how tactically valuable or how ridiculous irrelevant. The One Ring isn\u2019t in position to question the one single purpose that it was imprinted downright on its metal, its whole body, its entire \u201csoul\u201d.\nAll that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost.\nYou may think that the One Ring was lost, that it was wandering, but no......the One Ring was precisely where it wants to be! It found the Hobbits!Yes, the Hobbits in a quick glance, they aren\u2019t something to be worry about when you\u2019re planning to dominate Middle-Earth. Clearly, it was Sauron\u2019s point of view. You can\u2019t blame him. I don\u2019t think any military leader in his position would consider relevant to invest time and effort with the Shire.BUT the One Ring thinks otherwise.If the other races have to fall into darkness, into evil, then the Hobbits must be as well.The Shire is an oasis of peace, of light, of goodwill, of laughing, of dancing, of enjoying the basic pleasures of a more simple life......and the One Ring can\u2019t tolerate that!!! It\u2019s revolted by the very existence of such a good place inhabited by such merry species. Everybody, everywhere and everything must fall into its dark bind, into evil!!!If Hobbits fall into darkness, into evil, then and only then, Sauron\u2019s plans would be truly accomplished and the One Ring\u2019s purpose, fulfilled.\nRING ANY BELLS?\n\nBooks ought to have good endings.\nI am not a rookie with The Lords of the Rings since I watched all the movies, but certainly I knew that eventually I will read the books. While I am aware of what would happen here and in the next books, I still enjoyed plenty enough the reading, since I was able to notice the \u201clittle differences\u201d here and there, between the original writing and the modern film adaptations. Some time ago, I read The Hobbit and now I have read the first book, Fellowship of the Ring, but an important thing to have in mind is that hardly it\u2019s a \u201cfirst\u201d book per se, but the first part of one single book titled: The Lord of the Rings, since I can\u2019t blame other readers if they weren\u2019t satisfied with the development made in this first part.Characters took an \u201ceternity\u201d to begin a journey, to take a decision, to do anything. The few action moments are overly seldom spread and too quick developed, so you don\u2019t get a real sense of being reading something in the epic fantasy genre. Even some scenes aren\u2019t presented in \u201creal time\u201d but they are told after the things happened, stealing almost all thrill from them. Some random characters without any real utility in the story. An overwhelming telling of the vast background history of the Middle-Earth. And \u201cfinally\u201d, you won\u2019t get an ending here, this isn\u2019t really a whole book, but the first part of a novel.So, if you can have all that in mind, knowing that you will have to read other two parts to get the whole story, and trusting that you will get ample amounts of actions later, maybe, just maybe, you would be forgiving enough to enjoy the wonderful writing using words in such clever way, along with the majesty of the expansion of such rich literary universe.Keep up, my fellow readers! The journey is just beginning!", "Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.\nFrom the valleys of the Shire to the summit of Amon Hen, The Fellowship of the Ring is an extraordinary adventure of endearing characters defying impossible odds."], "A Short History of Nearly Everything": ["A Short History of GoodreadsSurveys show that nearly 40% of all Americans believe the history of literature started in 2007, when Amazon sold the first Kindle; indeed, Amazon Fundamentalists hold it as an article of faith that Jeff Bezos actually wrote all the world's e-books over a period of six days. This is, of course, nonsense. It has been conclusively demonstrated that literature is far older than the Kindle; books already existed thousands of years ago, which were the direct ancestors of today's e-publications. For example, careful examination reveals that The Odyssey and The Gospel according to Saint Mark are primitive versions of Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters and Bared to You. Similar relationships have been shown to obtain for all modern books.Problems arise, however, from the fact that these archaic protobooks still exist today; indeed, some have adapted to the e-reader environment and begun to thrive there. It is entirely too easy for an unsuspecting internet shopper to purchase a copy of Pride and Prejudice, incorrectly believing that it is part of the Twilight series. From the standpoint of formal literary theory, it is admittedly incorrect to say that Pride and Prejudice is \"worse\" than Twilight. They are simply different; neither one is \"worse\" than the other, since they have developed in different environments. From a practical point of view, however, a person who buys a Jane Austen novel is almost certain to be disappointed. There are no vampires or werewolves; sex is barely even hinted at; most upsettingly of all, the book will be full of long sentences and difficult words. The combination of these factors can only lead to an intensely unpleasant reading experience, which may discourage the reader from making new Amazon purchases for days or even weeks afterwards. Particularly given the fragile state of the US economy, this is evidently not an acceptable state of affairs.People have always exchanged recommendations and warnings with their friends, but it became clear that a more systematic approach was needed. There had to be a place where book-consumers could post advice and help each other avoid these infuriating mistakes, so that everyone could be sure of reading nothing but up-to-the-minute YA erotic paranormal romances.

I hereby petition Bryson to re-write all curriculum on behalf of the history of the world.I would run across things half-remembered from midterms and study guides and think, \"You mean this is what they were talking about? You have got to be kidding me.\" It's never condescending, always a joy.In fact, what I loved most is the acute, childlike sense of wonder seeping through the pages. How fantastic little we know about the world in which we live. All the great scientific leaps fallen through the cracks, all the billions of leaps that will never be made, every scientist who with an amiable grin shrugs to say, \"I don't know. We don't know. Who has any idea?\" The world is a magically baffling, enchanting place, and after nearly everything there is infinitesimally more.", "Okay, so here's my Bill Bryson story. I was in The Gladstone, a public house not too far from this very keyboard, with my friend Yvonne, who will remain nameless. We had been imbibing more than freely. A guy approached our table and asked me in a sly surreptitious manner if I was him. Him who? Was I Bill Bryson? Now it is true that I bear a very slight resemblancebut you could also say that about Bjorn from Abbaand a zillion other white guys with beards and gently rounded fizzogs. Anyway, without missing a beat I said yes, I was him. So the guy immediately asked me if I'd sign two of his books, and before I could say \"Come on mate, I'm not actually American, can't you bleedin well tell?\" he had zapped out of the pub. Only to zap straight back with two hardbacks of Bill's deathless works. What could I do? He opened them up reverentially and told me one would be for him and one for his mother. Friends, I signed them - \"Best wishes, your friend Bill Bryson\". He was so grateful, so very very pleased. We drank up and got the hell out of there. I look back on this disgraceful incident and shudder. That's the last time I'm impersonating a famous author.Short note on the book in question:There was no way our Bill could write a gently humorous book about the history of all of science without sounding like a fairly smirky know-it-all, so that's what he does sound like, which can be just a trifle wearing. LOTS of good info in here, but it's like being forced to live on Indian takeaways and nothing else, great for a while and then GET ME A SANDWICH! Or like being stuck on a long airplane ride with a very garrolous and opinionated fellow who thinks he is the very model of the modern travelling companion, regaling you with insightful and humourous anecdotes by the bucketful while you're wondering if it would be so bad if you faked a heart attack and you could whisper to the flight attendant \"I'm okay really but GET ME AWAY FROM THIS GUY!\"", "What I learned from this book (in no particular order)1.\tPhosphor was accidentally discovered when a scientist tried to turn human urine into gold.

Yes, it\u2019s true, I failed BOTH chemistry and physics in high school. I can't judge how accurate Mr. Bryson represents the sciences in this book, but it surely beats being bogged down in A Brief History of Time and their ilk.", "Bryson's dead serious: this is a history of pretty much everything there is -- the planet, the solar system, the universe -- as well as a history of how we've come to know as much as we do. A book on science written by a non-scientist, this a perfect bridge between the humanities and the natural sciences. A course in the history of science should be mandatory for every teenager, and this should be the textbook.Yes, it's a big, chunky book. No, it can't be trimmed down any further: when you're addressing cosmology, earth science, ecology and zoology, with healthy doses of chemistry and physics, plus the historical development of each, you're going to end up with a doorstop of a text, no matter how smoothly written. The wonder of Bryson's writing is that the reader doesn't get lost in these sweeping surveys. When name-dropping, Bryson always gives a short description of the person in question; if mentioned earlier in the book, he drops in a quick reminder to the reader. This is fabulously effective at giving the names some context, not to mention a little personality.And indeed, isn't that what science education needs most: more humanity and less intimidation? Those science-phobes out there who freely admit their near-complete ignorance of the subject should do themselves a favor and buy a copy of this book. No, don't get it from your library. There's so much here you'll want to have a copy on hand to refer to later.To those nerds in the audience -- myself included -- don't think your degrees mean you can pass this one over. As hyper-specialized as science has become, it's refreshing as hell to step back and take a look at things with new eyes. While there's not a lot here I haven't encountered before, there's a lot of information about how our current theories were developed that I didn't know.(Also? It's heartening to read about the social ineptitude, blind spots, and how utterly incompetent many of these scientist were in other aspects of life. Makes me feel better about never finishing that PhD -- at least I have a life.)Thorough, humorous, engaging, and educational: what's not to like?", "A Short History of Nearly Everything is Bill Bryson's summation of life, the universe, and everything, a nice little easy-reading science book containing an overview of things every earthling should be aware of.As I've repeatedly mentioned over the years, every time one of the casual-readers tells me I have to read something, like Harry Potter or the DaVinci Code, I dig my feet in deeper and resolve to never read it. This is one of the occasions I should have shaved a decade off of my stubbornness and caved in right away.Bryson covers a wide range of topics, from the formation of the universe to the evolution of man for our apelike forebears, and all points in between. Atoms? Cells? These are just stops along the enlightenment highway that Bill Bryson has paved! He touches upon quantum physics, geology, the size of our solar system, the year without a summer, and other topics innumerable.The writing style is so accessible that I have to think I'd be some kind of scientists if my high school and college text books were written by Bill Bryson. His easy, breezy style makes even the most complicated topics easier to digest.It's not often that I come away from a book having felt like I learned something new, criminal techniques from my usual reads excepted. Bryson has succeeded where many have failed before him. He has used chicanery to get me to read nonfiction and enjoy myself while doing it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.", "It's easy to nitpick A Short History of Nearly Everything. Bryson, by his own cheerful admission anything but a scientist, makes a fair number of mistakes. He says that all living creatures contain hox genes; he omits Alexander Friedmann and George Gamow from his description of how the Big Bang theory was developed; when talking about Darwin and Paley, he doesn't seem to be aware that Natural Theology was one of Darwin's favorite books and had a huge influence on him. Those are just a few of the glitches I happened to notice. I'm sure a real expert would have spotted many more.But so what? The author is incredibly entertaining, and I came across dozens of great stories from the history of science. He has done a fantastic job of tracking down details that you won't find in the other books! Continuing with Darwin, everyone's heard about the evolution debate between T.H. Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce; this was the dozenth time I'd seen Huxley's contemptuous reply to Wilberforce's question about whether he claimed descent from a monkey though his grandmother or his grandfather. But I'd never before read that Lady Brewster fainted, or that one of Darwin's Beagle colleagues wandered through the crowd, holding a Bible aloft and shouting \"the Book, the Book!\" Similarly, everyone tells you that Newton only published the Principia after Halley persuaded him to do it. But I hadn't heard that Newton intentionally made it as difficult as possible to read because he didn't want amateurs bothering him, or that Halley's reward was to be told by the Royal Society that since they could no longer afford to pay his salary in pounds sterling, he would instead be given remaindered copies of The History of Fishes. And there were numerous other stories I'd never seen at all. If you don't find plenty here to amuse and instruct, you're either encyclopedically well-read in all branches of science or you have no interest in it whatsoever.", "Picked this up on audiobook when I was on tour and listened to it in my car. I found it fascinating and informative. Kinda like a reader's digest version of the history of science. And even though I knew a fair chunk of what was mention, there was a lot of material I'd never even had a glimmer of before. Fair warning: If you are prone to worry about, say, the end of the world. This probably isn't the book for you.", "This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. There, I said itBryson's book combines the best qualities of science writers like Attenborough, Diamond, Durrell, and Wilson; presenting the information with the wit he is most known for. It is an amazing achievement to condense the entire base of human scientific knowledge into 478 pages, but Bryson has done it. I completely agree with Tim Flannery, who writes on the jacket that \"all schools would be better places if it were the core science reader on the curriculum.\" I certainly would have gained much if I had read it when I was 15.This is one of the few books that has truly challenged what I had previously held to be conventional wisdom (at least in my own mind). Two main changes have come about: 1. I had always been jealous of the \"true\" zoologists, such as Audubon and Darwin, who were around when the world was as yet unexplored, and discovering a species was as simple as being the first to walk into a patch of forest. I left science because the idea of being tied to a sterile lab held no interest for me. However, after reading Bryson's vignettes of early scientific/zoological exploration (much of which was both comic and tragic), I realize that those days weren't quite as idyllic as I had imagined. 2. Bryson does a \"good\" job of scaring the hell out of you by showing just how precarious our daily existence really is. I probably shouldn't say this, but it puts such problems as global climate change into context when you read how an eruption of the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone National Park would wipe out most of the life on earth in a painfully slow manner; especially when Bryson describes how this eruption is overdue by 30, 000 years by historical average.Combined with those two new impressions, I am left with the following conclusions, and a slightly rearranged outlook on life.First off, it is clear that science benefits from a large degree of serendipity. We as a species/civilization have been lucky to have some truly great minds working on deciphering the way our world works. Some of these are household names [Newton, Halley, Einstein], some are not [Henry Cavendish, Rosalind Franklin]. However, as with everything that us humans put our hands on, this endeavor wasn't perfect. Egregious mistakes, pathological lying, childlike rivalries and tantrums - they all occurred. On balance, whether they helped or hurt the effort isn't clear. But what is clear is that our present level of understanding was by no means assured.Secondly, the fact that life is so tenuous makes one a little more philosophical. Since I've finished the chapter about Yellowstone and similar catastrophic threats, I find myself asking \"what if today is the day?\" It can be rough when you get on the bus at the end of a particularly annoying workday, when the disagreements were petty and you didn't get much done, and think \"is that what I did on the last day of my life?\"Thankfully, that attitude only lasted for a short while, until I was able to reframe it in a more productive way. Now I tell myself not to worry about big problems that might happen in the future, because I know that we will be hit by a meteor, we will experience a supervolcano eruption. It's best to just enjoy every day, doing what you really know to be what it is that you want to do. Does that mean that I won't recycle anymore, that I will leave the tap running while I brush my teeth? No! Because doing things to reduce my impact makes me feel good, that I'm thinking about society's needs - not just my own. It's what I want to do.So, in an incredible way (that even Bill Bryson probably didn't predict) this book can really change your life.", "I was never any good at science. At the grammar school I attended we were shepherded into laboratories for lessons on physics, chemistry and biology. These were scary places; I\u2019d never been anywhere like this before. The physics lab had gas taps and Bunsen burners and the walls were filled with incomprehensible charts. The chemistry lab held rows of specimen jars, more gas taps and burners and an underlying smell of something unpleasant and vaguely dangerous. The biology lab displayed pictures and diagrams of human body parts and there were constant rumours of creature dissections and other nasty things to come. Beyond the physical fears it was clear that each subject had its own language. I was fluent in none of them. I ceased study on all of these subjects at the earliest opportunity.But I left school feeling that I\u2019d missed out on part of my core education. And I had. So I\u2019d had my eye on this book for some time. I\u2019ve long been a fan of Bryson\u2019s insightful yet amusing take on the world. Surely his commentary of all things scientific couldn\u2019t be too painful, could it? The book walks through just about every significant scientific discovery from the creation of the universe to the present day. Well, not quite the present day, given this book was published some fourteen years ago. But given the universe is currently thought to be some 13.7 billion years old, I\u2019m comfortable it covers the mother lode.The list of sciences included is exhaustive, I spotted whole bunch but I\u2019m also convinced I missed a few. My list comprises:AnthropologyAstronomyBotanyCosmologyChemistryEcologyGeologyHuman BiologyMeteorologyOceanographyPhysicsZoologyIt\u2019s fascinating stuff \u2013 staggering, in fact. I\u2019d heard of the Big Bang theory, of course, but I\u2019d never delved into the detail of it. The explanation here is clear and concise - it\u2019s still mind bending, but I was able to follow most of the explanation. There were some sections where the detail did become a little heavy \u2013 the account of plant life being categorised lumbered on interminably \u2013 but on the whole the pacing felt spot on. It\u2019s also very well structured, with relevant topics being grouped together. It flowed well and told a compelling story.As I worked my way through this book, the thought that kept leaping to the fore was that these brilliant theories and discoveries came about largely as a result of scientists and non-scientists working something out via observation, association and calculation \u2013 the kicker being that nearly all of these milestone events predate computers, email and the internet. It\u2019s incredible. In one example twenty years was spent on a calculation using pencil, paper and a slide rule. The same calculation could now be completed using a computer in a single day. Yes, because of its publication date there are a few recent finds that aren\u2019t included - confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson particle in 2012 is one example \u2013 but I really don\u2019t think it missed out too much of any significance. For anyone looking for a comprehensive but easy to follow history of scientific discovery, from the very beginning, look no further. I can\u2019t recommend this book highly enough."], "The Lord of the Rings (The Lord of the Rings, #1-3)": ["not a review and there probably won't be one any time soon. i also won't be climbing Mount Everest in the near future. but here are some cool illustrations that i found and want to share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld of the Ring by Jian Guo", "Twenty-five years ago I'd have given The Lord of the Rings my highest possible praise. I came to Tolkien's masterpiece on my own, and that meant much to me at twelve. The only books that had been reached by me alone were books on mythology and horror. Everything else I read, from DH Lawrence to Hemingway to Dickens to Shakespeare (and this also included Dracula and Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde because they were \"true\" classics), was suggested and sanctioned by my mother (for which I will always owe her deeply).But The Lord of the Rings was mine and mine alone. It is easy to forget that The Lord of the Rings was not a pop culture phenomenon in the seventies and early eighties. It was a fringe book (at least in North America), something that was not yet considered a part of the canon, something that was not a name on every boy's lips (even if they were just getting to know D&D) let alone every child's lips. Sure it was respected and loved by those who knew it, but knowing it was not a foregone conclusion as it is today, and its audience was almost completely genre oriented. In my little community (my school and the blocks surrounding my home), I was the first kid to read it.And that first reading was a revelation. Sure I'd read The Hobbit, but that didn't prepare me for the breadth and depth of The Lord of the Rings. Middle Earth in its grandest incarnation. To create a fantasy world is one thing, but to breathe life into ages of that world, to keep all the pieces together with such magnificent detail and rigour, to create character after believable character and make us care about most of them, even poor Smeagol/Gollum, that is a literary labour of Hercules. And by pulling it off, Tolkien created the single most important manifestation of Fantasy that has ever and will ever be written. The Lord of the Rings has rightly been named a classic. It is part of the canon, and it deserves its place. It is entertaining, it is weighty, and it is loved by nearly all.Aye...and there's the rub.Its indisputable greatness has made it indisputable. It has become dogma among fanboys and fangirls that the bastions of The Lord of the Rings are unassailable. Criticize Tolkien's work -- academically or otherwise -- and you put yourself in almost as much danger as a chatty atheist trying to engage in a theological discussion in a coliseum full of Jehovah's Witnesses (how many of those folks will make it into the afterlife? Isn't there a limit?).Feminist critics point out the lack of women in The Lord of the Rings, and that those women who are present fulfill only the narrowest stereotypes. \u00c9owyn's strength is dependent upon adopting male gender qualities, a typical stereotype of \"powerful women in fantasy,\" and she is alone amongst the Rohirrim as a woman who can and will fight. All other women in her culture are present as a reason to fight rather than as integral parts of the struggle. Arwen's place (in the books, at least) as a maiden waiting for the hand of her king takes the \"reason to fight\" to even greater heights. And the only powerful female, Galadriel as the terrible, beautiful elven Queen, is too far removed from mortality and reality to be anything more than a mid-tale deus ex machina, thereby removing her from the realm of women and men and making her a pseudo-god whose power is allowed only because it is arcane and mysterious. Post-Colonial critics have latched onto the racism inherent in The Lord of the Rings, pointing out the hierarchies between the races: from the \"superiority\" of the elves, to the \"chosen\" role of \"European\" Men of the West under the leadership of Aragorn, to the lesser races of Dwarves and Hobbits (the former are \"lesser\" because they are \"too greedy\" and the latter are \"lesser\" because they are children). Post-Colonialists look to the \"orientalization\" of Sauron's forces and the configuration of evil as an inherent quality of Orcs and \"the dark folk.\" They point out Tolkien's family's history as a cog in the mechanism of English Imperialism, and his own birth in one of the most blatantly racist colonies of all, South Africa (while he did leave at three years old, his family's presence there at all suggests that some of the classic colonial opinions about the colonized \"dark races\" helped form the man who wrote these books), as possible reasons for this racism. These criticisms further suggest, at least to me, that the archetypal source of all fantasy's entrenched racism -- even those books being written today -- is The Lord of the Rings. Those fantasy authors who have followed Tolkien consistently and inescapably embrace his configuration of the races (yes, even those like R.A. Salvatore who try and fail to derail this configuration) and the concepts of good and evil that go along with them, which leads to the stagnation and diminishment of their genre.The fact is that these flaws do exist in The Lord of the Rings. They are present. They are easy to find. But few of Tolkien's rabid fans want to hear about them. And even when the criticism is not necessarily suggesting a flaw in Tolkien's work but merely the presence of some subtext, the dogmatists react with rage and condemnation. A fine example of this is when Queer and Gender theorists point to the overwhelming relationships between men, and how the relationship between Frodo and Sam is homosocial, at least, and possibly even homosexual. The only true intimacy in the book occurs between the men, after all, and to ignore that fact is to ignore one of key components of why The Lord of the Rings is so emotionally satisfying, especially to young men. Even faced with these ideas supported by convincing arguments, however, many fans either strive for ignorance or attack the messenger. This may have much to do with the worry -- unreasonable though it is -- that to admit that a flaw or something uncomfortable exists in any of these books, which so many people love so deeply, is to accept that The Lord of the Rings is neither great nor worthy of love.But this is not the case. I love The Lord of the Rings even though I subscribe completely to the post-colonial criticism, and see the merits in both the feminine and queer criticisms, not to mention the countless other criticisms and subtexts that are floating around.The books are racist; they are sexist. They are not perfect. And I must criticize the elements of The Lord of the Rings that make me uncomfortable and deserve no praise. But my complaints and the complaints of critics make Tolkien's achievement no less great. Tolkien created the most magnificent imaginary world ever conceived, and, for good or ill, Fantasy would be nothing today were it not for him. The Lord of the Rings is a triumph on countless levels, but it is not the word of God, nor should it be elevated to such heights.I love The Lord of the Rings, but I love it with reservations. I love it because of its place in my personal mythology, its genuine originality, its creativity, its power, but I love it with my mind open to its flaws, and I refuse to make excuses for Tolkien or his work.Twenty-five years ago I'd have given The Lord of the Rings my highest possible praise. Not today. But I am still willing to admit my love.", "Considering that The Lord of the Rings is one of the most popular books of the last century, it's surprising to see how few reviews there are here. I get the impression that many people feel guilty about liking it. It's a phase you go through, and the less said about it, the better. I think this is unfair to the book, which, I am prepared to argue, is a whole lot better than it's generally made out to be; I don't think its huge success is just evidence that people have no taste. It's something that can be read at more than one level, and, before dismissing it, let's take a look at what those levels might be. On the surface, it's a heroic fantasy novel, and quite a good one. It's a gripping, well-realized story, with an interesting fantasy world as background. Under the surface story, it's also clear that there's a moral discourse. It's not an allegory; as Tolkien points out in the foreword, he hated allegory, and we certainly don't have an in-your-face piece of Christian apology by numbers. None the less, the author has constructed some inspiring and thought-provoking symbols. The Ring confers great power, but the only way to defeat Sauron is to refuse that power, and destroy it, even at great personal cost. Frodo's self-sacrifice is quite moving. I also think that Gandalf is an unusually interesting Christ-figure; sufficiently so that many people refuse even to accept him as one, though, at least to me, the argument on that point seems convincing. He comes from Valinor, obviously the Heavenly Realm, to help the Free Peoples of the West. A central part of his message is the importance of mercy, as, in particular, shown by the memorable scene near the beginning, when he rebukes Frodo for wishing that Bilbo had killed Sm\u00e9agol when he had the opportunity. As we discover, Sm\u00e9agol is finally the one person who can destroy the Ring. And let's not miss the obvious point that Gandalf is killed, and then returns reborn in a new shape. I find him vastly more sympathetic than C.S. Lewis's bland Aslan, and he is the book's most memorable character.But I don't think the morality play is the real kernel either. What makes LOTR a unique book, and one of the most ambitious experiments in literary history, is Tolkien's use of names. All authors knows how important names are, and use them to suggest character; though when you think about what is going on, it is rather surprising how much can be conveyed just by a name. Proust has a couple of long discussions about this, describing in great detail how the narrator's initial mental pictures of Balbec, Venice and the Guermantes family come just from the sounds of their names. Tolkien goes much further. Most of his names are based on a family of invented languages, linked by a vast complex of legends and histories, the greater part of which are invisible to the reader and only surface occasionally. The astonishing thing is that the technique actually works. The interrelations between all the invented names and languages make Middle-Earth feel real, in a way no other fantasy world ever has. When some readers complain that characters and locations are hastily sketched, I feel they are missing the point. Tolkien was a philologist. He loved languages, words and names, and tracing back what the relationships between them say about their history. In LOTR, he's able to convey some of that love of language to his readers. You have to read the book more than once, but after a while it all comes together. To give just a few obvious examples, you see how \"hobbit\" is a debased form of the word holbytla (\"hole-dweller\") in the Old Norse-like language of Rohan, how the \"mor\" in \"Moria\" is the same as the one in \"Mordor\" and \"morgul\", and how Arwen Und\u00f3miel's name expresses her unearthly beauty partly through the element it shares with her ancestor L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel. There are literally hundred more things like this, most of which one perceives on a partly unconscious level. The adolescent readers who are typically captivated by LOTR are at a stage of their linguistic development when they are very sensitive to nuances of language, and programmed to pick them up; I can't help thinking that they are intuitively seeing things that more sophisticated readers may miss.Perhaps the simplest way to demonstrate the magnitude of Tolkien's achievement is the fact that it's proven impossible to copy it; none of the other fantasy novels I've seen have come anywhere close. Tolkein's names lend reality to his world, because he put so much energy into the linguistic back-story, and before that worked for decades as a philologist. Basically, he was an extremely talented person who spent his whole life training to write The Lord of the Rings. In principle, I suppose other authors could have done the same thing. In practice, you have to be a very unusual person to want to live that kind of life.Writing this down reminds me of one of the Sufi stories in The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mullah Nasrudin. The guy is invited to a posh house, and sees this incredibly beautiful, smooth lawn. It's like a billiard table. \"I love your lawn!\" he says. \"What's the secret?\"\"Oh,\" his host says, \"It's easy. Just seed, water, mow and roll regularly, and anyone can do it!\"\"Ah yes!\" says the visitor, \"And about how long before it looks like that?\"\"Hm, I don't know,\" says the host. \"Maybe... 800 years?\"", "Look at thisss, hobbitses!

You step onto the road, and if you don\u2019t keep your feet, there\u2019s no knowing where you might be swept off to.\"\nI\u2019ll kick off this review by telling a little story. A story starting, as the stories often do, with 'once upon a time'...Once upon a time, there was a little boy who have never read a fantasy book. Thinking back on it, it does seem like an awfully sorry state of affairs. He was a devoted reader already as a quite small child, but he mostly read children\u2019s books like The Hardy Boys and other juvenile and boyish stories like them. The one day he discovered this huge brick called The Lord of the Rings, and started reading it. It would change his life forever. There were other books at the time, for instance the immensely popular Harry Potter series, which was being published back then, but none of them could ever hope to compare to what was now the little boy\u2019s favourite book.The little boy grew into adolescence. He read other books, few of them fantasy. He discovered a passion for history, and started reading that. He read classics and sci-fi and mysteries and even religious texts. He read books considered by some as among the best books ever. And none of them could ever hope to compare to what was still the boy\u2019s favourite book.Later that little boy would grow up to become a man (though he probably never will grow up completely, mind you). And he started reading fantasy again. A Song of Ice and Fire was one of the first attempts, and it quickly turned into a favourite. But compared to The Lord of the Rings? Nothing. It was followed by tons of other fantasy series, among them Narnia, The Inheritance Cycle, Shannara and so on. And he loved them all. But every once in a while, he had to go back to this huge brick to remember that there existed something even better.\n\"Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.\"\nI have been struggling for years to describe The Lord of the Rings. How do you actually describe the book you both love more than any other, and also consider the best book ever written from a more or less objective point of view?I recently dumped into the word sublime, which I\u2019ve only heard used on a few occasions before. I knew what it meant, but not the exact definition. So I checked.- Of high spiritual, moral, or intellectual worth.- Not to be excelled; supreme.- Inspiring awe; impressive.- An ultimate example.And that is pretty much exactly how I would describe it. Sublime it is. I realised that I would never come closer to an actual description of The Lord of the Rings. This is to me not only the main pillar on which the fantasy genre stands, but the ultimate masterpiece of literature.I\u2019ll use a far-fetched example to make my love for this book sound totally crazy put my love for this book in perspective: if I had to choose between reading this book once and having unlimited access to all the other books ever released, then I would choose this. No contest even.I am so very grateful to have been given the chance to come along on the journey of the Fellowship of the Ring. To visit so many wonderful places in a land of myths and magic. To meet so many fascinating men, elves, dwarves and other legendary peoples and creatures...Are there any negative things to mention? No. In my mind there are none at all, but I\u2019ll say this: Tolkien\u2019s characters are not the best I have encountered, and the storyline of this book is not perfect. That\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll ever come to witness me criticizing this wondrous gem, and the only things you\u2019ll ever hear from me about it except for fanatical ravings and unsolicited praise.\nI sit beside the fire and thinkof people long agoand people who will see a worldthat I shall never know.But all the while I sit and thinkof times there were before,I listen for returning feetand voices at the door.\nIf perfection exists and is obtainable, then Tolkien\u2019s worldbuilding is perfect. There is nothing in either fantasy or any other genre to match it. It certainly surpassed all the magical worlds that had come before it, and none created since that time have been able to surpass it in turn. Writers like Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin have made their attempts, and now we\u2019re talking about more of my all-time favourite fantasy worlds and series, but in my eyes, none of them have even come close.I have had tons of delightful experiences while venturing into magnificent worlds of fantasy, in Westeros and Narnia and so many others. But Middle-Earth is like a fictional home. I seem to have left behind parts of my heart and soul by the waterfalls of Rivendell, the ancient trees of Fangorn forest, the plains of Rohan and the marble walls of Minas Tirith. And I do not regret that for one second.Most of my standards for comparison also derive from this tome. I have yet to encounter a mentor character in fantasy who can compare to Gandalf, or a fictional love story that can compare to the tale of Aragorn and Arwen. I have yet to encounter a setting as detailed or writing as flawlessly eloquent as this. And those are only a few examples of aspects in which I consider The Lord of the Rings to be superior to all others.These musings can only begin to describe how much this book means to me. It sparked my passion for reading at a young age. It made me love the fantasy genre and all that came with it. It made me start creating worlds of my own, and in the end find one in particular that I liked so much I started writing stories set in it. Why, it even made me intrigued by poetry eventually. But I have yet to read anything by any famous poet that can match Tolkien\u2019s utterly incredible poems.On my third and fourth and fifth reads of this book, I started looking beyond the immediately visible. And I found something more to admire: the man himself. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien went on to become my most important role model, and despite having been gone from this world for forty years, he\u2019s been heavily influencing my personal opinions and choices for more than a decade. And not only literarily, but historically, politically and philosophically as well.This book is definitely the one single object that\u2019s had the most impact on me, and it\u2019s meant a lot more to me than one should think any object could be capable of. But then again it\u2019s not really an object after all. It is so much more. A legend trapped in words on pieces of paper. A magical gateway to the most amazing world you\u2019ll ever see.This is to me the apex of human creativity and imagination. The very best form of art a human mind can produce.There have been many books that I have cherished through the years, and I expect there will be many more to come. But The Lord of the Rings will always be the one I treasure the most of them all.It has changed me forever. As it once changed the world forever.\n\"I amar prestar aen, han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han noston ned 'wilith.\"\nSo that's all I have to say for now. I'm afraid this was not so much an actual review as simply a story about my experience with and passion for this book. If you've been patient enough to read to the very end, I thank you for your attention. I'll leave you with the most beautiful passage Tolkien ever wrote, and my favourite literary quote of all time...", "Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood, especially by those they have inspired, and Tolkien is no exception, but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an 'innovator of fantasy'. He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers, and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators, but for the most part, these techniques are little more than bad habits.Many have called Tolkien by such epithets as 'The Father of Fantasy', but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre. For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors, from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to R.E. Howard and Fritz Leiber, it is clear that, long before Tolkien, fantasy was already a complex, well-established, and even a respected literary genre.Eddison's work contains an invented world, a carefully-constructed (and well-researched) archaic language, a powerful and unearthly queen, and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness. Poul Anderson's \nThe Broken Sword\n, which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring, has distant, haughty elves, deep-delving dwarves, a broken sword which must be reforged, an epic war between the armies of light and darkness, another central character trapped between those extremes, and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviews.So, if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien, then what does set him apart? Though Dunsany, Eddison, and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict, they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch, recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes. Tolkien (or C.S. Lewis), on the other hand, has no problem in depicting evil as evil, good as good, and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart, as in Gollum's case--and even then, he is not like Eddison's Lord Gro or Anderson's Scafloc, characters who live under an alternative view of the world, but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkien's dualistic morality.It is a dangerous message to make evil an external, irrational thing, to define it as 'the unknown that opposes us', because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world, which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do, following Tolkien's example. Whether it's Goodkind's Libertarianism or John Norman's sex slave fetish, its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side 'right' and the other side 'wrong', and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas. Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black, spiky armor, and a lot of people will never notice that all the 'good guys' are White, upper class men, while all the 'bad guys' are 'brutish foreigners', and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the world.In Tolkien's case, his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of 'Merrie England', which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories (like Tolkien) to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders, the farmers were all happy in their 'proper place' (working a simple patch of dirt), while both industrialized cultures and the 'primitives' who resided to the South and East were 'the enemy' bent on despoiling the 'natural beauty of England' (despite the fact that the isles had been flattened, deforested, and partitioned a thousand years before).Though Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws, he did his best to scrub the rest clean, spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm. But then, that's often how we think of Tolkien: bent over his desk, spending long hours researching, note-taking, compiling, and playing with language. Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist, sexist, and classicist leanings (as, indeed, do many great authors) still praise the complexity of his 'world building'.And any student of the great Epics, like the Norse Eddas, the Bible, or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding: those books presented grand stories, but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy, history, myth, geography, morality and culture. They were encyclopedic texts, intended to instruct their people on everything important in life, and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history, because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describes.So, Tolkien fills his books with troop movements, dull songs, lines of lineage, and references to his own made-up history, mythology, and language. He has numerous briefly-mentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics, which were formed slowly, over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions. He creates characters who have similar names--which is normally a stupid thing to do, as an author, because it is so confusing--but he\u2019s trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names, which many great families of history had. So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did, but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tell?Simply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art. Art is meaningful--it is directed. It is not just a list of details--everything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story. The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth, especially since Tolkien\u2019s world is not based on some outside system--it is whatever he says it is. It\u2019s all arbitrary, which is why the only thing that grants a character, scene, or detail purpose is the meaning behind it. Without that meaning, then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise. Now, it\u2019s certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it, but that\u2019s equally true of many thought exercises, such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game, or crossword puzzles.Ostensibly, Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love words--and yet, top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn. Likewise, many literary fandom games become little more than word searches: find this reference, connect that name to this character--but which have no meaning or purpose outside of that. The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas, to looking at how we think and express ourselves. If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves, then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaff.The popularity of Tolkien\u2019s work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing, to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the \u2018depth of its world building\u2019, I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing, of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree, as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the hero\u2019s cuirass, we'll forget that he\u2019s a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivation.When Quiller-Couch said authors should \u2018murder their darlings\u2019, this is what he meant: just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them. Anything which does not materially contribute to the story, characters, and artistry of a work can safely be left out. Tolkien's embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books, leading to the meandering, unending series that fill bookstore shelves today.Now, there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkien\u2019s work has had on the genre, such as in Moorcock\u2019s \nEpic Pooh\n and Mieville\u2019s diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old don's influence. I agree with their deconstructions, but for me, Tolkien isn\u2019t some special author, some \u2018fantasy granddad\u2019 looming over all. He\u2019s just a bump in the road, one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity, and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas weren\u2019t unique, and while his approach may have been unusual, it was only because he spent a lifetime obsessively trying to make something artificial seem more natural, despite the fact that the point of fantasy (and fiction in general) is to explore the artificial, the human side of the equation, to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition. Unfortunately, Tolkien\u2019s characters, structure, and morality are all too flat to suggest much, no matter how many faux-organic details he surrounds them with.My Fantasy Book Suggestions", "The Fellowship of the Ring begins with the Shire and winds its way through the barren lands that lie on the way to Mordor. I tried to read this part of the book once, but DNF it then. Then I picked up the trilogy bound in one volume and went through it fairly steadily.I've read that Tolkien wasn't as original as first claimed. There is a book called The Broken Sword that has parallels with LotR. Nevertheless Tolkien take on traditional myths was unique and groundbreaking. The Eddas, the Welsh myths, and Norse myths all are the foundation for this great story.This was a reread and was a satisfactory one because I wanted to reach my favorite parts. I looked forward to read Tom Bombadil's part again. Did it. Then the Rivendell parts, ditto. Slowly I wound my way, sometimes following Sam and Frodo, sometimes Aragorn. Gandalf appears relatively scantily towards the third book. I had a lot of fun reading LoTR, and I've not yet deleted it from my Ereader because I'm tempted to reread it soon. Five well deserved stars, indeed.", "One of the greatest trilogies of all time and certainly the measuring stick to which all subsequent fantasy-style writing is compared, The Lord of the Rings trilogy still stands at the top of the stack. Its realism, the characters and monsters, the storyline, the epic battles, and the quest motif are all drawn with incredible care by Tolkien in his chef d'oeuvre. My favorite was The Two Towers but all three are absolutely stunning. It has been a few decades since I read them so perhaps this year I will have to journey back to Middle Earth once again.", "I\u2019ve been trying to write a review of this for over six months now, but all that seems to come out is something like this: Well, the ring is my copy of the book.

This very abbreviated phase introduces a number of Big Ideas inspired by the original work -- the notion of a probability continuum, most notably, and \"plural zones\" -- and it's a shame that Adams didn't get a chance to incorporate all these ideas right from the start, as they would have certainly led to some direction in the otherwise flabby middle episodes of the series.This phase doesn't have much urgency to the plot, and rushes through large swaths of story to reach the ending... or non-ending, as it turns out, as all the characters come back out for one final bow. This is, perhaps, as satisfying an ending as you could expect from a storyline that's taken the listener through multiple dimensions and character iterations: there isn't one pat ending, because there isn't one single storyline, but a whole great mishmash posing as a coherent story. The quintessential phase is an attempt to reign in all the scattered particles of story and put a neat bow on it. It doesn't quite work.The neatest ending, however, would have been not to end at all and to leave the story back at the end of the original Hitchhiker's story -- Arthur and Ford, exploring a strange, unexplainable universe with only a trusty towel and a battered Guide to lead them.", "Stylistically speaking, this is as good as anything Adams ever wrote. A lot of people, however, object to the plot. The book upon which this is based is called Mostly Harmless, but it is anything but. The radio adaptation, however, pretends the ending was all an elaborate joke and gives us several happy endings connected inter-dimensionally. While the last few minutes of this radio play (not written by Adams, as I understand) are funny enough, it does feel like a betrayal to the original story. Mostly Harmless IS supposed to be that devastating. Arthur Is supposed to *spoiler* lose Fenchurch because of a stupid bureaucratic clause, and everyone is supposed to die horribly so that Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz can put a tick inside a box. That's just the universe.

Maggs and the BBC decide to impose thier own forced happy ending on the material for no reason I can make out and I just feel sorely disappointed that it's all over. Still, this is heaps funnier than the Quandary phase and a joy to listen to. I've loved hearing the old cast reprise their roles 25 years on and they really get into it. (It's a big shame there's not so much Zaphod and Marvin in these later novels, though) and casting choices for other roles have been generally great, with the production of the shows being fine.

I hated reading when I was a kid, but I loved the woods. I liked survival stories and learning about nature. Hatchet was one of the few books that I actually enjoyed. After reading Hatchet a few dozen times, I moved on to the rest of Gary Paulsen\u2019s Brian books.In Guts, Paulsen talks about the real-life events that inspired him to write the Brian series. He has lived an unusual life, mostly in remote places. He writes about his time as a paramedic in rural Colorado (very close to where I currently live). He also tells stories about surviving in the wilderness in Minnesota and Alaska. Gary Paulsen has actually lived through everything that happens in the Brian books. This memoir covers his experiences with heart failure, plane crashes, animal attacks, and hunting mishaps.Paulsen\u2019s writing style is conversational. I read this book straight through without putting it down because it felt like I was listening to a friend tell stories. I laughed out loud several times. The author has a way of understating deadly problems that makes me laugh. Then I feel terrible about laughing at his near-death experiences. They\u2019re funny, though!My favorite story is the one where Paulsen and his 14 sled dogs got trapped in a blizzard and needed to be rescued by plane. The dogs were loose inside the plane and lost their minds when it took off and started bouncing around in the storm. During a 20-minute flight, the dogs destroyed the plane\u2019s interior. They bit the pilot and almost caused the plane to crash. Not cool, dogs. The moral of the story: dogs on planes know no chill. My second-favorite story is the one where Gary wanted to know if it was possible to eat turtle eggs. He tried eating one and threw up. His dog caught the puke and swallowed it before it hit the ground. Again, not cool, dogs.\u201cWe have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\u201d \u2013 GutsIf you\u2019re not interested in hunting or wilderness survival, then this book might not be for you, but for me, it was perfect. It\u2019s a quick, funny read that distracted me from the rest of the world. You\u2019d probably get the most out of Guts if you\u2019ve read the Brian books, but it\u2019s not completely necessary. The stories are entertaining on their own.", "Geesh I forgot that the first story in this book has about a bazillion reference to death, including a scene wherein a plane breaks in half and the people \"spill out\" into the water and are eaten by sharks and a really sad scene where a 50 year old man dies of a heart attack (described with vivid detail) at the dinner table?I remembered when I was reading it aloud to the 3rd graders and they keept asking \"is this real\"?! and I kept having to say \"yes\".that being said he does a pretty great job of tying in his experiences to the fictional texts they inspired.oh wait! dogs. there are dogs that get thrown. from the back of the plane to the front of the plane.

DOGS GET THROWN!", "I taught seventh grade middle school for 35 years and during part of that time the sixth grade read Hatchet. Naturally when they came to me the following year some were hooked on Gary Paulsen books. From time-to-time I find myself reading teen books out of habit and desire, I have a list of authors I still enjoy and Gary Paulsen is one. His books have always made me feel I was sitting listening to him tell me the story.If you have read or you know someone who has read the \"Brian\" books I would recommend this book by Paulsen. In it Mr. Paulsen explains how some of the situations Brain finds himself in are based on his own life experiences. Although I purchased the book from a school book club I would also suggest it is good reading for any of the hunters in your life. It is fascinating to read how Mr. Paulsen made his own bow and arrows, as well as, teaching himself to hunt with this homemade equipment through trial and error. Finally it is a quick read for those reluctant readers. 150 pages and not full pages of reading. Enjoy something different.", "I have met Gary Paulsen and love his books. Guts was entertaining, serious, and filled with information about wilderness survival that I simply did not know. A few times, this book made me laugh out load!", "This is a great book. This book is one of the best books that I have read. It is great story written from Gary Paulsen which is a good writer. Everybody please read this book if you like fun stories.", "Due to widespread clamor among his fans to hear the true stories of how Gary Paulsen gained the intimate knowledge of wilderness survival he wrote about to such convincing effect in Hatchet and the other Brian's Saga novels, the author released Father Water, Mother Woods: Essays on Fishing and Hunting in the North Woods in the 1990s. It was well-received, but readers lobbied for more. They craved specifics about the incidents in Mr. Paulsen's life that directly inspired thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's harrowing adventures in the Canadian bush, adventures that could easily have killed the boy before rescuers arrived. Thus Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books was born, a memoir specifically of the events that started the author thinking about writing a novel featuring a kid forced by circumstances to survive in the wilderness, far from the comfort and protection of modern urbania. For readers who want the scoop on Hatchet, Guts has everything you could want...and more.  \"The wilderness pulled at me\u2014still does\u2014in a way that at first baffled me and then became a wonder for me.\" \u2014Guts, P. 71 Gary Paulsen led a life of more variety than almost anyone, and volunteer paramedic in the Colorado boondocks was among his myriad occupations. As the only first responder close enough to react meaningfully in an emergency, Paulsen bore responsibility for the lives of many. This was where he learned about heart attacks, the most common malady of patients he was called to help. Paulsen could do nothing to save the majority of myocardial infarction victims, and one death that happened right in front of him haunted the author long after, coming through in Brian's experience with the pilot of his small plane who suffered a heart attack and died while their vehicle was airborne. As a paramedic and as an officer in the U.S. military, Paulsen also witnessed numerous plane crashes, some fatal but most not, and had a scare while on tour for his 1986 Newbery Honor book Dogsong when the engine of the small plane he was a passenger in sputtered and died. The pilot landed without any problem, but the helplessness of hanging 3,000 feet up in the air in a plane that had no engine would inform Brian's panicked response when the same thing happened to him with dire consequences. Another life-or-death situation involving a small plane saw an intrepid bush pilot flying into an insane winter storm in Alaska to rescue Paulsen and his sled dogs during the Iditarod. The incident leaves an indelible impression even as the scene it sets is downright comical. By the time Paulsen was honorably discharged from the military and had trained to earn his pilot's license, he was well on his way to knowing enough to write intelligently about Brian's plane crash. Bizarre animal assaults play a pivotal role in Brian's Saga, from rampaging moose to hungry bears, from surly skunks to monstrous swarms of mosquitos. Paulsen relates anecdotes about his own encounters with these assailants and more, but the most memorable may be when a massive cow moose waylaid him on a stormy night in the Alaskan bush. The attack was unprovoked and nightmarishly prolonged, as attacks feel when blow after vicious blow is hurting us and there's nothing we can do to stop it. The moose had Paulsen facedown in the snow and would not relent from stomping on him, bloodying the helpless musher and cracking his bones. \"She completely worked me over. I didn't count the kicks and stomps but there were dozens. She stopped after a bit and I peeked at her, outlined against the snow, and she was staring at me, listening for my breath, and when at last I could hold it no longer and had to breathe again she heard it and renewed the attack. I don't know how long she kept after me. It seemed hours, days. I lay as still as possible, trying to hide my breathing, but she kept coming back until I thought I was dead\u2014and then she backed off. Thinking she was gone, I tried a small move, but she jumped me again. Finally I think she was convinced I was finished and she moved off into the forest.\" Sometimes all you can do when you're assaulted that way is curl up in a trembling little ball and hope to survive, and that's how Paulsen (and Brian) lived through their run-ins with lunatic moose. The only way to endure in a world that threatens your existence is to adapt and learn from its painful lessons, to not make serious mistakes twice. \"The solution to facing all these dangers, a solution that came very rapidly to me and to Brian, is knowledge. It can come from anywhere; from reading, from listening to people or from personal experience. However it comes, the knowledge must be there.\" Accumulating wisdom is the way to fend off danger whether you're in the wilderness or the safety of suburbia, which presents its own perils. Learning to avoid pitfalls is a trait possessed by every survivor.  Brian's ability to stay alive in the bush hinged on fashioning functional hunting weapons with no one to teach him how, and Paulsen recounts his own experiences in this area. Crafting a usable bow and arrows from wood is hard work, and learning to hunt with them is more difficult still, but Paulsen and Brian each eventually did. The process requires attention to detail, and the author doesn't scrimp on explaining how to carve the wood and arrows just right. If the feathers aren't the proper shape and style, your arrows won't fly accurately. Once you make a kill, you have to clean and cook the animal, and that's at least as much work as carving handmade weapons. Paulsen relates his long, arduous journey after killing his first deer with a bow and arrow as a fifteen-year-old, dragging the dead buck that weighed more than him miles from the scene of the hunt to where he'd stashed his bicycle. It's hard to imagine how he biked four miles home while attempting to keep two hundred pounds of dead deer in balance, but Paulsen at that age was already adapting to the ways of nature, learning to be inconspicuous and predict what would happen next in the drama of the natural world around him. He knew it was essential to never stop growing and improving. \"To learn, to be willing to learn how a thing works, to understand an animal in nature, or how to write a book or run a dog team or sail a boat, to always keep learning is truly wonderful.\" This from someone who was not a diligent student in school, but had a passion to learn from nature the grand truths of life that school teachers rarely address. Spending time in school does not always equate to learning. Revolting food choices were part of life for Brian after his plane went down, but starvation pushed him to choke down edibles he wouldn't have wanted to look at in his previous life. Paulsen had high standards for the realism of Brian's Saga: \"When I set out to write the Brian books I was concerned that everything that happened to Brian should be based on reality, or as near reality as fiction could be. I did not want him to do things that wouldn't or couldn't really happen in his situation. Consequently I decided to write only of things that had happened to me or things I purposely did to make certain they would work for Brian.\" This includes the gross experiment of eating raw turtle eggs, which didn't end well for Paulsen. His commitment to authenticity in Brian's Saga was admirable, and stems from the undoubtedly finest philosophical observation in Guts, made in an earlier chapter. \"We have grown away from knowledge, away from knowing what something is really like, toward knowing only what somebody else says it is like. There seems to be a desire to ignore the truth in favor of drama.\" These words have so many practical applications, I hardly know where to begin. We outsource our religious, political, and social opinions to others who tell us how they think things are, not bothering to independently inform ourselves so we can challenge the pundits when they reason wrongly. Society has grown away from self-discovered knowledge and toward parroting the talking points of professional opinion givers, and that's not healthy. When we reject the nuance of reality in favor of black-and-white systemic ideology, we don't further education as Paulsen promotes it; we further ignorance, hampering our ability to recognize our errors of logic and reverse positions if the facts demand it. Gary Paulsen writes with uncompromising regard for truth, and that's why I love his work. Guts ends with a chapter on rudimentary cooking methods in the wild\u2014how to heat water, make meat or fish stew, and cook using wood planks, a roasting spit, or a pot made from birch bark. It's important not to waste any part of the animals you hunt, because a next meal is never promised in the great outdoors. Paulsen concludes with an anecdote about the time he roasted buffalo meat for himself while employed as a movie production laborer, enjoying the fine meal under a starry night sky with a friend and reflecting on how it must have felt for early man to do the same every night. That started him thinking of writing a story about a modern-day kid having to survive under those conditions, and the rest, as they say, was history. The wisdom of Guts isn't as enlightening or plentiful as that in Woodsong, an earlier Gary Paulsen memoir of wilderness life, and the stories aren't nearly as emotional, but it's a good book. I'd give it at least two and a half stars, and strongly consider the full three. Gary Paulsen created something unforgettable in his Brian's Saga books, and I have loved them. They changed me for the better, and that can't be said of most literature. We've never seen a writing talent quite like Gary Paulsen, and we are oh so lucky to have him.", "\u2018Guts\u2019 by Gary Paulsen was a considerable novel. I really liked the overall story line as well as the action packed, real life situations Gary Paulsen experienced. The book was based of a similar, well know, novel \u2018Hatchet\u2019, which Gary Paulsen wrote 15 years before publishing \u2018Guts\u2019. During the book, Paulsen describes his near-death experiences in the wilderness chapter-to-chapter making the reader feel as if they where standing right their, with him. Each chapter is based of real life events which where published in his bestseller \u2018Hatchet\u2019, but from the perspective of the main character Brain Robeson, a 13 year-old boy. One reason I really liked this book, was because of the action. Normally when you see a biography it doesn\u2019t seem very interesting, but Gary Paulsen did an outstanding job. The book starts with a chapter called, \u201cHeart Attacks, Plane Crashes, and Flying\u201d. It starts by describing Gary Paulsen\u2019s life before he was fortunate enough to become a successful writer. He lived with his wife in a small prairie town in the middle of farm country, and with so much down time, Paulsen volunteered as a medic with only a small ambulance, which was donated by the city. Gary Paulsen, being the only service available for thousands of square miles, had to witness many deaths mostly form heart attacks. And sadly, Paulsen was the only hope except for the city helicopter, which sometimes took hours to arrive. This book was a great read, and I recommend it for someone who\u2019s looking for an easy quick-read. If theirs one thing I learned from Gary Paulsen\u2019s life, it was that well\u2026.it took guts.", "\u201cGuts\u201d is a book written about the events that led up to Gary Paulsen writing about Brian Robeson\u2019s story in the books: Hatchet, The River, Brian\u2019s Winter, and Brian\u2019s Return. The first chapter is about the experiences Gary has had with airplanes which is how Brian ends up in the wilderness alone in \u201cHatchet.\u201d The whole book is basically about all the times Gary has had encounters in the wilderness and how he had to cope with the problems he had. The main character in \u201cGuts\u201d is Gary Paulsen. There are other characters but they are not as important. The story is not really written in a set place. Gary talks about all the times he is in the wilderness so you could kind of say it is taken place in the wilderness but it is never really said. It is written from the time he was a young teen to a middle age adult. The main theme in this book is determination. Gary is saying how he has had so many tough times in the wilderness and he had to be determined to make it out alive. Another theme could be creativeness because Gary has to come up with ways to cook things, and make things while he is out in the wilderness. Overall, I thought that this book was very good. I always was putting myself in Gary\u2019s shoes asking myself what I would do. I would recommend it to people who like to read books that are written about the wild and like adventure.", "Now I know why the Hatchet and Brian books did not appeal to me. This book is a nonfiction book about how many of the scenarios and situations came about in Hatchet. Very interesting but not my cup of tea. Hunting and the wilderness do not have an appeal to me. But the stories were well told and and interesting.I did notice something in this book though. Paulsen talks often in his book about earning money for food and school clothes as a child. I am a mother and thought, \"That is great that he is helping his parents out. He is older. He must have lived during the depression.\" But other clues lead me to believe he is not that old. (He was in the army as a young man during the Korean War.) There is one sentence in the entire book in which he discusses his parents. He said that he had to hunt because his parents were in one of their drunks. His parents were drunks, did not hold jobs, and left him to fend for himself at an early age. I am impressed with what he has done with his life. Very interesting book."], "The Changeling Sea": ["Whenever I think about this novel, I feel warm. I feel at home. This is the book that made me fall in love with reading, the very first one I bought with my own savings, more than 10 years ago. It took me half an afternoon to finish it and, once I was done, I immediately went and reread it, skipping homework and totally forgetting about the world outside. I remember I found it magical and beautiful, simple and yet complex and intense in its semplicity. It gave me such strong feelings, made my mind and heart travel to places I never thought existed. I often reread it, every now and then, and every time it's like the first time. No matter how great or famous or brilliant or heartbreaking a book is, it will never be as important to me as this one is. I still cherish it and forever will, too.Because it's my most precious treasure and it taught me how to dream.", "\"What have you done?\" she asked herself aloud. \"What have you done?\" She answered herself a few moments later. \"I've gone and fallen in love with the sea.\" Flawless!Patricia McKillip should give lessons in how to write fantasy romance - imaginative, charming, balancing a tear with a smile, loneliness with selflessness, poetry with the prose of day to day living. She is one of the most consistent writers of modern fairytales I have come across, her lyrical style immediately identifiable, yet bringing something fresh and original with each new book she writes. She infuses even the darker stories with beauty and a sense of wonder, and she turns a deft hand at light comedy when the situation requires it. She felt as if she had stepped into some dream where anything might happen: Her head might float away and turn into the moon; starfish might walk upright onto the sand and dance a courtly dance. Peri, as in Periwinkle, is a young girl who lives in a small village by the sea. When she loses her father in a violent storm, she puts a curse on the cruel sea, throwing into the waves some of her amateurish magical wreaths. Who would believe that a simple scullion girl in the local inn might have the power to awaken terrible forces from their deep blue slumber? Yet soon enough, a magical dragon starts to haunt the sea near the village, a magnificent multicolored beast that is chained to the bottom of the sea by a heavy gold chain. A young man, the obligatory \"tall, dark stranger\", is also haunting the beaches, always looking out to the sea. Pretty soon, another young man will mirror the first one by gazing longingly from the beach towards dry lands. Both of the boys find refuge in the humble hovel of the girl Peri. And spring is coming to the world, awakening in the three young hearts the thoughts of romance. The air was warm, silken, promising longer, lazy days, more light, promising all the soft, mysterious smells and colors of spring after the harsh gray winter. The sand itself was streaked with colors from the sunset. Love triangles have been done to the death in the genre, so expect McKillip to not be satisfied with this classical set-up, and to make Peri a girl with her head screwed the right way onto her shoulders, not too easily swayed by the Heathcliff vibe of tragic destiny in the young bucks coming to her door. Read on, and you might find the resolution of romance to be a logical, if unconventional one. (view spoiler)[ There's a third young man, a young wizard named Lyo, who waits quietly in the background for Peri to realize there's somebody who is not a prince or a tragic hero, yet wants to spend his whole life by her side.  (hide spoiler)]The plot is inspired by the old Celtic legends of the Changeling, by the magical realm of the faeries existing hidden beside our own reality, and by the dangers of crossing this invisible barrier between the real and the magical realms. There's a legend like this in the kingdom where Peri lives, a mystery that she unwittingly steps into and must now help to unravel. Once upon a time there was a king who had two sons: one by the young queen, his wife, and one by a woman out of the sea. The sons were born at the same time, and when the queen died in child-bed, her human son was stolen away, and the sea-born son left in his place. Why? No one truly knows, only the woman hidden in the sea, and the king. And perhaps the king does not even know. Why? Why is the wind, why is the sea, why is a long road between the world and me. I believe I have said enough about the plot for now. I would like to add, as usual, that one of the reasons I love McKillip stories is the treatment of magic in her imagined worlds. Like Guy Gavriel Kay, she considers magic not as a mechanical, learn spells by the rote and cast them whenever you need them, sort of Force. Magical is a secret and wild thing, elusive and unpredictable, a talent that requires an open mind and a lot of patience to develop. Kyo, the young magician hired by the villagers to recover the huge gold chain holding down the dragon, explains to Peri how he experiences magic: Slowly you learn to turn the dark into shapes, colors ... It's like a second dawn breaking over the world. You see something most people can't see and yet it seems clear as the nose on your face. That there's nothing in the world that doesn't possess its share of magic. Even an empty shell, a lump of lead, an old dead leaf - you look at them and learn to see, and then to use, and after a while you can't remember ever seeing the world any other way. Everything connects to something else. In the current novel, this majesty, mystery and danger of magic is symbolized by the sea, a fickle mistress that can in the blink of an eye turn from coy to murderous. Lyo, with his magical eye, can unveil the poetry of the sea in a way that the gold crazed locals have long forgotten in their daily drudge of earning a living. He seemed delighted by the sea life, as if he had seen little of it, yet he rowed fearlessly farther than Peri had ever gone, out to where the very surface of the world was fluid and dangerous, where the sea was the ruling kingdom they trespassed upon in their tiny, fragile boats, and the life and beauty in it lay far beneath them, in places forbidden to their eyes.  The Changeling Sea  is one of the novels I would love to see turned into a movie (especially after watching the horrible example of what passes for rom-com today with \"Trainwreck\"). It may not be action filled or grimdark or even epic, but it has style and charm enough to put me in a good mood, more inclined to see the wonder of the world around me instead of its dinginess. It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.", "\"Come out of the sea and into my heartMy dark, my shining love.Promise we shall never part,My dark, my singing love.\"This is no ordinary book. It is a key to another realm. I journeyed through the labyrinthine pathways of her heart to enter a secret world full of magic and beauty. And I am forever changed. I have always been a creature of the sea. My soul heard her song and found it's way to her shore. She gives me shelter from the storm. Her heart keeps me warm.Thank you, Lia, for sharing this precious treasure with me. I will cherish it as I do you, always. \u221e------------------------------Note: I listened to this on repeat throughout. It fit so perfectly and added even more depth and wonder to my experience. \u2661", "My goal for next year was to read more female fantasy authors. I started this a tad bit early, but was unable to put it down. I hope I find more authors like this while achieving my goal!I don't normally like books with romance in them. Especially romance books that are also Young Adult. This book was way out of my comfort zone being shelved under both.But the writing was so well done and the tale so beautiful that I enjoyed this one immensely.Everyone who tells the tale of a sea- journey, or listens to it, travels there safely and comes back again.The story is about a girl named Periwinkle who has lost both her parents to the sea - her father who disappeared while fishing and her mother who stares at the sea all day mourning his loss. Using spells taught to her by an old lady before she too mysteriously disappears, Peri hexes the sea.\"I hex you. I hate you, I curse you, I lay a hex on you, Sea so that all your spellbindings will unravel, and all your magic is confused, and so that you never again take anything or anyone who belongs to us, and you let go of whatever you have.\"And thus begins a whirlwind story of two princes, a King, a magician, love and the land under the sea.I highly recommend this book, and I am looking forward to exploring this author's other works.", "Another winning tale by Patricia McKillip. This is only the second book I've read by her, but I'm convinced she can do no wrong. There's something delightful and magical about the way she writes that pulls me into her stories, and I don't surface until the last page is turned.It doesn't happen often to me, but once in awhile I come across a book and wish I was young again to enjoy it with an open, less burdened mind, and to enjoy it in the spirit it was written and, just for a moment, be its target audience again. This is one of those rare books in which the magic is real; I just can't feel it anymore.Even though I enjoy it now and really like the writing, it's a cold, intellectual kind of enjoyment. Lovely prose, lovely\u00a0story. I love the way it reads on the page and can methodically deconstruct all the things that I like about it and appreciate the parts as much as the whole story, but it doesn't hit me right in the feels like The Forgotten Beasts of Eld. Yet\u00a0I'm certain I would have loved this book more when I was younger, when I would have been eager to be fully immersed in the mystique of the sea and its mysterious magical pull. I think, back then, I would have been able to hear it calling as clearly as Peri.\"Be happy now,\" she whispered, aware of all the shining waves behind him reaching toward him, withdrawing, beckoning again. She added, feeling the pain again in her throat, \"When I'm old--older than the old women who taught me to make the hexes--come for me then.\"\"I will.\"\"Promise me. That you will bring me black pearls and sing me into the sea when I am old.\"\"I promise.\"[...]\"Your heart sang to the sea. I heard it, deep in my coral tower, and followed the singing. Humans say the sea sings to them and traps them, but sometimes it is the human song that traps the sea. Who knows where the land ends and the sea begins?\"\"The land begins where time begins.\"[...]\"It's an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.\"Cross-posted at https://covers2covers.wordpress.com/2...", "Originally posted at Paperback Wonderland.Sometimes people ask me to recommend a book and it usually goes a bit like this:Hipster girl: Hey do you know which book I shoul--Me: The Changeling Sea!~*~Metalhead dude: Hey, I've been thinking about readi--Me: The Changeling Sea!~*~Mum: Any books you--Me: The Changeling Sea!~*~Some friend: Got any books yo--Me: The Changeling Sea!Some friend. You always say that! I've already read it!Me: READ IT AGAIN.Anyone who's lived their whole life by the sea will tell you that it's hard to successfully write a story that will give you the sense of wonder and possibility it brings. A Menina do Mar comes to mind, and though it's a children's book it's absolutely perfect, perhaps because I read it when I was a little girl and those books always have a special place in our hearts. The Changeling Sea through what I can only assume to be some freaky magical powers Patricia McKillip possesses, managed to be placed into that same corner of my heart even though I've read it as an adult. I guess that's the highest praise a book can get.", "This is a gorgeous, bittersweet, perfect, completely unsatisfying story. It's a fairytale that feels real. All of those things at once? Yes. I didn't like the other book by this author I've read nearly as much -- perhaps not at all, I can't remember. But this is lovely. It's a story about longing, really, longing and love. It spellbound me, and managed to capture something I love about the sea: its beauty, humans' fascination with it, its danger... Dar Williams' The Ocean comes to mind here, somewhat.It's not really a story tied together by plot, but by emotion, and Kir's longing, Peri's love and hope, the king's sadness, it all got to me. The book is short, but I'll be thinking about it for a while. Another comparison that comes to mind is Susan Cooper's Seaward.", "This short, standalone novel (a novella really) written in McKillip's usual beautiful yet elliptical style is exactly the sort of thing that I come to expect from her work.A lowly scullery maid, who's fisher father died at sea and who's mother is psychologically lost to the sea, hates the ocean and tries to put a hex on it but ends up becoming embroiled in powerful magic and the King's family who's one time tryst with the sea queen is coming back to haunt him.Those who have read McKillip before will find the evocative prose and the opaque dialogue, in which the characters seem to talk around each other, quite familiar. Once again the emphasis is not on action but rather the emotional conflict and tension.Not quite up to the standard of The Forgotten Beasts of Eld but a very good book nonetheless.", "Heart-breaking, atmospheric and unforgettable.This story was all I could ask for, and more.It doesn't need three hundred or four hundred pages, much of them filled with boring details to tell its story.It slowly arrives, it tells its tale, it imprints it in our hearts and minds, and calmly goes away...A coming of age punctuated by loss and finding what's important in one's live.\n\"It\u2019s an odd thing, happiness. Some people take happiness from gold. Or black pearls. And some of us, far more fortunate, take their happiness from periwinkles.\u201d", "My daughter and I both enjoyed this book about magic, loss, loneliness, and people wishing for things they can't have and to be things they can't be. There were some pretty heady concepts in here, and some nicely complex language. The little one ate it up like shrimp chowder with a spoon. And, y'know, I kinda did, too."], "Bill Bryson's African Diary": ["All the Bryson goodness you've come to know and love at half the calories!Actually, it's more like a 10th the size. In fact, the worst part about Bill Bryson's African Diary is its shortness. This slim volume is more about awareness and philanthropy rather than a literary or journalistic endeavor for its own sake. Bryson heads to Kenya to check out CARE International's charitable works. Times are tough there. Clean drinking water is at a premium. There's some slight heart-string pulling, but it's not Sally Struthers sappy. Just the right amount of compassion. Tidbits of Bryson's trademark humor are wedged in between the descriptions of the ravaged slums and gorgeous beaches. His style and low-key flair are present in small quantities. This would be perfect for the Bryson noob who wanted to test the waters before diving into the deep end of his more chunky books.", "In 2002, CARE International invited Bill Bryson on an eight day trip to tour its humanitarian work in Kenya with him writing it up into this, Bill Bryson\u2019s African Diary (something of a misnomer as Bryson only visits Kenya). The entire proceeds of the short book will go to help the kinds of people depicted inside it - and it\u2019s a wonderful read too!As you would expect, the horrors of the country\u2019s widespread poverty aren\u2019t ignored as Bryson visits Kibera, a shanty town on the outskirts of Kenya\u2019s capital city Nairobi, with a population of between 700,000 and 1 million people. The conditions are appalling and thousands are HIV positive and yet the place officially doesn\u2019t exist and is ignored by the Kenyan government. He also visits a refugee camp where the people there are stuck in a bureaucratic limbo, stateless, just existing, with little chance of a future. But the book isn\u2019t all a sobering guilt trip as Bryson also takes in the wonders of the Kenyan National Museum which houses 500 of the roughly 5000 fossilized human bones in existence, and Olorgasailie, an area where early humans made tools for a million years! There are also gently humorous passages in Bryson\u2019s inimitable style involving the dangerous and poorly maintained railways and the nightmare of flying in a light aircraft during a storm. The most interesting and inspiring part was seeing a bank called Wedco give loans to develop small businesses, helping give some of these people a shot at a real life that they wouldn\u2019t have without it. And the small village of Ogongo Tir where CARE installed a new well for them but gave them responsibility over it underlining that, while they need a hand to get the ball rolling, the people there want to take control of their own destinies rather than depend forever on the West. I hesitate to use the word but Bill Bryson\u2019s African Diary is entertaining, as well as informative, with Bryson serving as a genial conduit to learning about CARE International and its outstanding work in Kenya. It\u2019s a quick read but a memorable and moving one with an excellent cause at its heart - well worth picking up especially as the purchase price goes to help these people\u2019s lives become a little better.", "CARE, an international aid agency headquartered in the UK, asked Bill Bryson to visit their Kenyan operation and write about it. Somewhere along the lines the idea changed to include publishing a \"book\" and using all profits as a donation to charity, with a small amount of the $12 cover price used for printing and distribution costs. Most of the participants were volunteering their time.Sounds like a great idea, right? Except, the book itself is disappointing. It's more a novelette. It's 40 pages in an undersized book with big margins. About 90% of the content is him worrying about dying in the trains, planes and automobiles that might crash along his journey. Only about 10% covered actual Kenyan life and country. Almost no history was included in complete contrast to the book I read prior, In a Sunburned Country. It's not that it's badly written -- but it could have been so much better. He visits a refugee camp and barely talks about it for a paragraph, while devoting three pages to the airplane flight back. He visits a micro-lending organization and spends a sentence talking about his interaction with the borrowers. Ironically, he praises a local Kenyan farmer growing non-indigenous crops, the same action he highly criticized in In a Sunburned Country for damaging the Australian outback.This was a great idea under-executed. And it's a shame, because I think had it been done right, say trade the hard cover for an additional 40-50 pages of content, and this would have been great. Having a better story would have sold more books making even more money for the charity. I'll give him a C for Charity, but a D for leaving the real story out of the book. Bill short changed himself, Kenya, and CARE by pulling his punches in the name of charity.", "I feel like an asshole for not giving this more stars. I am an enormous Bill Bryson fan -- I've read everything else he has published (with the exception of \"Shakespeare: The World as Stage\" which I'm starting tonight). Unfortunately, this sort of wasn't a Bill Bryson book. It was a Bill Bryson... journal entry. It was only 49 pages, and because it was done for charity, it was overly sincere. It almost completely lacked Bryson's signature humor. He normally has such a colorful way of describing things that I even enjoyed his science book, \"A Short History of Nearly Everything.\" This was more like 49 pages of \"Kenya is a real shithole and the people need help.\" Nevertheless, I wish I was able to give it more stars, because I just like him so much, and because it is for charity. So, you know, go spend the money so it goes to CARE, but don't expect to spend more than an hour with it, and don't expect the kind of laughs I can still conjure up just by thinking of certain scenes in \"A Walk in the Woods.\"", "This is not really a book. It is Bill Bryson's Diary about his 8 day trip to Kenya with CARE international. It's just 55 pages long. I got it from the library due to being interested in charity work. I found it odd that it was in the library in the first place as it is not for profit and all the proceeds go to CARE...surely having a copy in the library defeats this purpose?....anyway...Content wise, it was okay but limited. The descriptions of the slums and various people Bryson met were interesting but there was not enough proper detail due to the limited writings. He also describes other experiences at length; e.g taking a trip on a light aircraft. I found his descriptions of these experiences over dramatised...frequently referring to the likelihood of death etc.....There was the odd swearword but for a non-Christian book it wasn't too bad. I found myself wondering what the purpose really was in writing this book. It reminded me again of the tragedy of offering help without hope. The author wonders what else can be done for these people, many of whom are refugees and he comments that they have no hope for the future. He doesn't realise the significance of his observations, but reading that as a Christian, his words jumped off the page....There can be no future hope without the saving message of Jesus and freedom from sin!http://christianmissionaryuk.blogspot...", "This is a pretty short travelogue (a week's diary) written as part of an initiative from CARE to bring in visibility and focus to the enormous challenges being faced in Africa, and the stellar work that CARE and similar organisations are doing. Kudos to the thought behind this initiative, inventive and world-wise enough to know the innovative channels to tap to bring in the much-needed publicity. I'm not going to be patting the backs of Bryson and the publishers too much, because no-profit doesn't mean that all costs were borne by themselves (CARE would have still had to pay for all the expenses of the tour and the printing costs), and the no-profit tag is being applied only financially.About the book itself, it started off breezily in Bryson-esque fashion, and has enough Brysonisms thrown in, in terms of facts, numbers, large-picture observations, that-could-be-me-thinking-that thoughts, and self-effacing humour. There is nothing of the touristy Kenya that I anticipated, with the trip sticking to the various camps and places that CARE is working upon. However, just when I was settling in a bit, the book ended, leaving me to get off the table with just the appetizers served.So, don't expect Bryson writing about game drives in Masai Mara and watching flamingos in Lake Nakuru, or the typical Bryson research into the fantastic work being carried out, or any comprehensive write-up about the history of the camps, challenges and way forward. The intent is purely to provide a glimpse at what CARE does, without getting into much detailing, and it sure does its job, as it pushed me into doing a bit more online reading about it.", "First of all, this is not a book. It's a diary. Bryson recounts his 8 days in Kenya with members of CARE International. And that's 7 days longer than I'd want to be there. What a dreadful place! Poverty, crime, hunger, lack of sanitation, no clean water, disease, corrupt government and a hostile climate. Some of the other reviewers on Goodreads fault Bryson for not covering enough ground, but I disagree. You don't need to read 300 pages to see the terrible conditions in which these people live EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES! This short \"booklet\" is enough to make the point. And if you read between the lines you will notice that Bryson runs us through a gamut of emotions ranging from humor before the journey, to fear about the trip, to disgust upon arrival, to sympathy when connecting with the locals, to enlightenment when he understands that the solution to the problems are within reach. I checked out the Kindle edition from the Chicago Public Library at no charge so I am donating $10 to Care.org to cover the donation that would have gone to them with a bookstore purchase. If you read my review and read a Kindle edition please do the same. We CAN make a difference. Thank you.", "This should really be Bill Bryson's Kenyan Diary, since that's the only country he visits. I had been looking for this book for a while, but I didn't realize that it was a slim charity volume, with all proceeds going to CARE. As such, it does its job, presenting the excellent work of CARE and other organizations in Kenya, with a dash of Bryson's signature wit. It did its job, showing the country's poverty but also its beauty, and the tireless work of those who are investing in the country through model farms, microloans, and other self-sufficiency projects. I'll be making a donation, since I bought the book used.", "Some of it was good Bill Bryson.It was very short but for a good cause.", "Bill Bryson on tour in Kenya for Care. It's not quite the fast-paced fun of his other travels, but in ways a more important story, about aid to real people so they can make their own luck.And if you are looking for that Bryson flavor, do not fear, there are dangerous travels by train and air, and sound advice to poke people with something bigger than a pool cue if they claim that aid money will disappear into the pockets of corrupt politicians. And even buying this book is doing good - it all goes to support Care's efforts."], "The John McPhee Reader (John McPhee Reader, #1)": ["You know how every New Yorker article you've ever read takes some seemingly mundane item or place and then writes the hell out of it? It starts out interesting but by page 12, you remember you're not actually interested in whatever the topic is.Well it turns out that every single one of them is just copying John McPhee, who is so much better at the genre than anyone else. It's unreal. These were just excerpts and I now want to read half the books they're from. He has a perfect eye for scenery and ear for dialogue, so each vignette captures exactly what he wants it to in a couple of paragraphs. Wow.", "I realize that giving five stars to a reader is sort of like saying that some band's greatest hits album is your favorite CD. That said, I think that John McPhee is one of the two best American reporters (along with Studs Terkel) and that this collection does a great job of providing an introduction to his work.", "It's probably a cliche to say that John McPhee is a writer's writer, but that's only because he never seems to have the same acclaim among more casual readers. And, as this collection shows, that's a damn shame.The first John McPhee reader is a well-edited collection showcasing selections from his first dozen books and cover everything from the cultivation and selling of fruit (Oranges), an in-depth profile of two tennis stars (Levels of the Game), the quirky scientists who design and built atomic bombs (The Curve of Binding Energy), the head of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (A Roomful of Hovings) and more. Taken as a whole, it's nothing short of stunning that McPhee is able to cover to much ground and do it all so well; he feels equally at home going into scientific workings of nuclear propulsion as he does writing about basketball. Of course, as anybody who's read McPhee before knows, the core of this book is based around two kinds of writing: writing about people and writing about nature. And in the book's strongest sections, McPhee does both. The excerpt from Encounters with the Archdruid is so detailed, you feel not only like you're riding in a canoe down the Colorado River, but that you know both Floyd Dominy and David Brower, are party to their fighting and know it's because they're both equally passionate about their work. But that's only one section. His trip in a birchbark canoe is just as good, as a working vacation to a Scottish island. It's all good, and like the best anthologies, it made me want to pick up each individual volume. Highly recommended.", "I read what I wanted to out of this- it's nice that the book covers a wide range of topics. I like his sportswriting the most- it really digs into the thought processes behind the most minute decisions of a game.", "Stopped in the middle because my library hold expired, but I'd gladly check it out again and keep going down the line.", "Interesting and well written set of articles. Some feel relevant still.", "Originally published on The Librarian Next Door:His name may not be as widely known as Woodward and Bernstein, but John McPhee still has plenty of accomplishments. An American writer and journalist, McPhee is considered one of (if not the) originators of creative nonfiction. He\u2019s been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize four times; he\u2019s also won the Pulitzer Prize, in 1999, in the General Nonfiction category. McPhee\u2019s work sometimes defies categorization. He\u2019s a journalist, with an obsessive attention to detail and facts, but he\u2019s also a literary writer, weaving stories out of those same facts.Last month, my book group read The John McPhee Reader as our selection. This book offers samples of a wide range of McPhee\u2019s writing, from his earliest pieces for The New Yorker magazine, to his later works that stretched into full-length books. The selections are wide-ranging and diverse. There are profiles of specific people (including a young college basketball star named Bill Bradley who would eventually run for President), the history of Florida\u2019s orange groves, and even a story on a hybrid airship. Despite the fact that nearly all of the selections are taken from larger works, they don\u2019t feel out of place or incomplete. Each selection stands easily on its own, a testament to McPhee\u2019s skill as a writer to make every word count.McPhee attended Princeton and continues to teach there to this day, so there is a subtle sense of elitism that pervades The John McPhee Reader, especially with regards to his profile of Bill Bradley (a fellow Princetonian) and a profile of Thomas Hovings, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But McPhee also writes about the people of New Jersey\u2019s Pine Barrens, and the crofters on the island of Colonsay off the coast of Scotland. Whatever his own experiences were or are, McPhee has the enviable ability to fit in with his subjects and draw out their own thoughts, ideas and opinions. Most of all, the level of detail is mind-boggling. From a description of the precise appearance of a piece of art, to so-strange-it\u2019s-true facts of an orange-growing empire, McPhee packs his essays, articles and books with a truly impressive number of details.Interestingly, the one part of the book I found most interesting wasn\u2019t written by McPhee at all. The editor, William Howarth, introduces The John McPhee Reader with a McPhee-esque mini profile of the writer himself. In it, Howarth outlines McPhee\u2019s personal and exceptionally disciplined approach to writing. It\u2019s a fascinating and intimate look at how the writer embraces his craft and how McPhee works meticulously in stages, tweaking and pruning his words until what remains is exactly right. You\u2019ll end up reconsidering your own writing style as a result.McPhee\u2019s talent is undeniable, so if you\u2019re a fan of creative nonfiction, The John McPhee Reader is a great introduction to one of the first and still one of the best when it comes to literary journalism.", "This book contains 12 articles, or chapters, that were written by McPhee from 1965 to 1975. The strongest single element in these works is McPhee\u2019s use of detail. In The Pine Barrens McPhee tells the story about New Jersey\u2019s great forest, the Pine Barrens, and its back-woods inhabitants, the \u201cpineys.\u201d The piece is richly appointed with details about the history of the Pine Barrens, the people who live there, and the forest itself. Consider the following description of a piney named Bill Wasovwich:\u201cIn a straight-backed chair near the doorway to the kitchen sat a young man with long black hair, who wore a visored red leather cap that was darkened with age. His shirt was course-woven and had eyelets down a V neck that was laced with a thong. His trousers were made of canvas, and he was wearing gum boots.\u201d McPhee lets us actually see this character by painting him in such vivid details. He gives us colors, hues, and textures that make his words spring to life, and leaves firm images in a readers mind. McPhee extends the use of details to the historical narratives he utilizes in his works. Here is an example from The Pine Barrens.  \u201cThe wizard\u201d of the pines was Jerry Munyhon. He could make a cat\u2019s paw come through a key hole. He could cause axes to chop wood by themselves. He could cause money to multiply. He was bulletproof. And he once caught a bullet that was fired at him and handed it back to the man who had done the shooting.\u201d Page 77, paragraph 2. McPhee had to talk to many piney to get all these wonderful details about the Munyhon, and he gives us a marvelous look into the folklore of the pineys as a result. But McPhee is also keen on using details to describe things as well as people and history. In A Roomful of Hovings McPhee profiles the life and times of the New York Metropolitan Museum\u2019s director, Thomas Hoving. He describes an important ivory artifact that Hoving procured for the museum called the Cross of Bury St. Edmunds in the following passage.\u201cCarved in walrus ivory, the two foot cross had sixty-three cryptically abbreviated inscriptions in Greek and Latin and a hundred and eight carved figures, which were sharply detailed and extraordinarily alive in their gestures and expressions\u2026.\u201d Page 110, paragraph 1. This began a long and detailed description of the artifact and its history that went on for four pages. I was enthralled by both the descriptive and historical details that McPhee used, and am convinced that he becomes an expert on anything he writes about.", "If you have never enjoyed non-fiction, this book will prove that it's possible to do so. Dense with facts and figures, the narrative is so compelling that you'll forget it's not fiction, you'll take an interest in topics to which you'd previously never given a thought, and you'll wish you could meet the people that McPhee is describing.This book offers a sampler of McPhee's work, taking excerpts from a dozen books. My favorite involves a rafting trip down the Colorado River to which he invited a radical conservationist and the head of the US Water Reclamation District, who would put dams every 20 miles of the river's length if he could. What a ride! I also really liked his tribute to the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy.The book's biggest shortcoming is that it is going to make my \"to-read\" list even longer, because now I am compelled to read the full version of several of these pieces.", "A terrific place to start, but really this is dipping one's toes. McPhee is a consummate journalist, one of the best I've ever encountered at simply packing each line, paragraph, and piece with valid, juicy information. The man was my gold standard when I wrote Deaf Side Story and remains an idol today.But it's not just the prose, it's his topics. One could say he is (often) an \"environmental\" writer, but that's too simple, and misses the mark: what McPhee does so well is to pick the exact focal point within a larger field, be it art of geology, and zero in on what's important.Not just a \"reader,\" this is a primer on solid, valuable non-fiction."], "The Known World": ["there is that old adage that a good book will tell you how to read it. and i have no idea to whom that should be attributed, only that my undergrad professors seemed to have been born to quote that thought endlessly: in my gothic lit class, my enlightenment class, my victorian lit class... the african and irish lit professors mostly kept their mouths shut on the subject. but the rest - hoo boy - did they love to drag that old chestnut out... and it makes sense, to a certain degree. but this book doesn't tell you how to read it so much as it presents itself to the reader, like a fat man in a speedo lolling around on an undersized towel saying, \"look at me ladies, you like it?? this is what you get!!\" it almost demands that you read it and like it.but i was disobedient.every sentence, every paragraph, seemed to be trying to contain multitudes. and i am a fan of \"thick\" writing, but the manner in which this book presented itself quickly soured on me. there were too many stories or episodes ending with, \"years from now, when celia was on her deathbed, she would think back to her third year of marriage\",in a scene where she has yet to even be married, or right after two characters are introduced to each other, \"this would be the last time they would meet until the hailstorm of aught-six\" - and i am making up all the names and situations here, but you get an idea of the shape of my complaints. it's constant foreshadowing and some of the foreshadowing is just teasing, as the events never come to pass in the novel itself. it's like sitting down to tea with a god in his dotage, rambling and making connections only he can understand; seeing the past and future simultaneously.\"hey, karen, didn't you really like that kjaerstaad trilogy, where he basically did what you are complaining about here??\"yeah, what? so? shut up - isn't it past your bedtime??yeah, but sure, that's true. but for some reason, it bothered me here. all i wanted was a straightforward linear narrative about a fascinating subject matter: free black men and women who owned slaves. when i read roll of thunder, hear my cry last summer, the whole transition period between slavery and freedom really excited my brainparts. i dunno. and mister jones was a real sweetheart when he came for the new yorker festival and i waited in line to get a book signed for a friend and i really wanted to like it because it seems like a nice fat sprawling sweeping story the way i like, but i just got lost in the names and the timeline and my confusion turned into apathy. it's like this guy you date who seems really perfect - he is smart and looks like gabriel byrne and he dotes on you and everything is fun and on paper it all looks great and you know you should really like him, but he just doesn't make you laugh so you run off and leave him for a rockstar. you know? because i feel like i should like this one because it is award-winning, and my experience with the african-american novel is middling (although i love the african novel, the west indian novel and the afro-canadian novel - go figure) so i feel like as someone who appreciates literature in general, i should totally love this. but it wasn't there for me.oh, chris wilson, i am sorry. now you are going to want full custody because your baby is being raised among heathens. years from now, when my and chris wilson's book-baby became the mayor of littleton, he would read this review and a tear of sorrow would come to his eye at my short-sightedness.", "I know this is a critically acclaimed book, a Pulitzer winner, and a book tackling a difficult and complex stain on America history: slavery and black slave owners. There are moments when the book does say some interesting things or reveal some unsavory and uncomfortable truths, but it was so hard to engage with as a reader. I mean, I hung in with DFW through the first 600 pages of Infinite Jest where nothing happens -- but because I was fascinated by Hal, Orin, Marathe, Steeply, and Mario and Madame Psychosis who all fascinated me. There were literally dozens of other characters but these all pulled me in. In The Known World, there are also dozens of characters but none that I grew any attachment too. It was as if the author Jones was using a hand-held camera and no stabilizer so that the images were jumpy and out of focus. It reminded me sometimes of how the world seems to my myopic eyes between taking off my glasses in the morning and putting in my contact lenses. The narration also highly annoyed me. All the parenthetical \"in 60 years so and so will do such as such\" were meaningless because I was given neither enough time nor enough detail to give a shit. Further, there is this reference to \"years later they would all turn into human torches in front of the dry foods store\", but no mention afterwards of to what this referred. But the most annoying bit was in using the Canadian journalist frame at about page 130 or so (which then only briefly appears in the narrative 200 pages later in a parenthetical throwaway comment, it is said that the journalist would never marry his heart's desire yet 3 pages later, they marry and that coming to talk to Fern that there was some incomprehensible stuff that happens off-screen that morning (also never adequately explained) and so she was not going to open up to the journalist and yet we still find her filling in details about Henry, Moses and Caledonia 30 pages later. Too much inconsistency - was the editor asleep or stoned and missed these?So, despite taking on a complex subject, Jones is no Faulkner as his South does not eve approach that of the Great William. He is not as good as Pynchon or DFW is manipulating time and space in a narrative that was 100 or 150 pages too long and felt it, and he is not Alice Walker or Toni Morrison who brought us the most amazing, poignant, and powerful images of slavery and its residual impacts generations later that I have ever read. So, read Beloved or Absalom, Absalom if you want to hear about the South and I expect you will be less frustrated, but every bit enraged at this deplorable institution that is a cancer on the American past.", "Manchester County, Virginia doesn't exist. Never has. After reading The Known World, however, you'd be forgiven if you thought you could take a tour of it's plantations and slave cemetaries on your vacation to colonial Williamsburg. The complicated pre-civil war Southern society that Edward P. Jones creates feels as real and surreal as any factual history of slavery you've read. It was not so much the story of Henry Townsend, a black slave owner, and all the people that his death allows us to meet that engaged me. It was the world, a world where I could taste the soil I might till and the women I might marry and the terrible choices I might be faced with, that put it's claws in me and refused to let go.It took me nearly 2 months to finish the book's 388 pages. It should've been a quick read. It is a fascinating place with peculiar problems and characters I cried for on more than one occasion. It should've been a quick read but I kept asking myself this question: who would I have been? The slave, toiling away in the field? The overseer, unable to see the world for what it truly was? The freed man, working desperately to free the rest of his family? The smart child, taken under the wing of the rich white slave owner and convinced that there was nothing wrong with owning another human being? The broken black man tortured by his family's wealth built on the backs of men and women that look just like me? The slave too proud, too strong, too powerful to let another take his freedom? Who would I have been?Who am I now?In matters of race, there is always that fool's point, usually made by a white person (though not always) that asks,\"why aren't you over it, already? Can't we just let it go?\" It is a way to end an uncomfortable conversation. The reasons don't matter. I know many a person for which the sticky tar baby of race in America is simply a discussion they can't stick their hands in. It is too difficult. Too raw. Too cloudy to be sure that people will remain friends after an honest chat. The way I feel when I read books like The Known World is my answer. No matter how well-adjusted, how integrated, how loving of my fellow man, how multiculti kumbayah I am, I'm not over it. I can't let it go.This fictional world was very real not all that long ago. It's effects still ripple through our every day. The world I know doesn't exist without it.Highly highly recommended.", "Dear The Known World:I'll be blunt. I'm breaking things off. This just isn't working. It's not you; it's me. Well, maybe it's you, too, a bit.I really thought when we got together that we would have a brief but mutually satisfying relationship. I'd read you, you'd provide enlightenment or emotional catharsis or entertainment, maybe even all three. All the signs were there: the laudatory quotes on your jacket, a shocking and unexpected premise, high marks on goodreads. But something was just off by the end of the first chapter. Maybe it was the masturbation scene right at the start. Or the characters that I just couldn't get into - I could hardly tell some of them apart. Or the way the narrative seemed to skip all over without any focus. Maybe I just didn't give you enough pages. I'm sure you got better as you went along. I mean, look at all the four- and five-star reviews you've gotten! But every time I picked you up my thoughts turned to the three other books on my bedside table that I'd rather be reading. I haven't actually been unfaithful, but that's just not a healthy basis for a relationship. So after 72 pages, I'm putting you down.Don't feel too bad. Focus on all those other, good reviews and maybe we'll meet again someday when the stars all align just right. But probably not.EmilyFor more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves.", "I'm going to have to rave a bit, because this is one of the best books I've read in the past ten years.Jones packs in all the historical detail you could want, and of course he's hit on a subject--black slaveowners--that in and of itself is tabloid-sensational. Where lesser writers might lean too hard on the sensational aspect (or rely on it to bolster an otherwise weak narrative), Jones works it into a compelling and powerful story.What makes it so powerful is a mix of fascinating characters who are woven into a series of overlapping plotlines. For me it's the structuring that is so brilliant (geek alert: I actually diagrammed the time shifts in the chapters as an exercise, to see when and how Jones yoked the whole thing together). This less than linear approach might be frustrating to those who just want things to be straightforward, but stick with it: the shifts provide suspense as well as texture, and they propel more than one storyline at once. They do all come together, trust me.I also admire the overarching authorial voice in the novel, which certainly leans toward the formal, but also comes across as aware of the history it's grappling with: here and there Jones projects his voice forward for a moment, or seemingly digresses with factual material and research. Again it's all part of the tapestry and the mix, and I also think that the level of narrative awareness (which never disengages long enough to derail anything) adds another layer to the very idea of history--making the whole historical and contemporary both.And for those of you who can do without all of the above writerly blather (a thousand pardons), you'll find in this book characters who are engaging, ignorant, cruel, earnest, sympathetic, tragic, hopeful, flawed--in short, complicated. Halfway through you'll be fighting off the impulse to skip ahead to learn everyone's fate.Finally, I'll say that this book isn't perfect--there are aspects of what I've described above that sometimes don't work: narrative turns that do seem pointless digressions, a character or two a bit stereotypical or annoying. No matter. This book aims high, as brilliant works of art do, and the result is nothing short of amazing.", "In this book I learned that there used to be black slaveholders in the US. I thought that only white people were allowed to own slaves during the time that owning slaves were like owning properties. During that pre-Abolition time. During those sad dark days in the American history.Black Edward P. Jones (born 1951) wrote this historical epic novel, The Known World based on the not well known fact that there were some black slaveholders (black people owning black slaves) in the state of Virginia during the time in the US when owning slave is legal. Wikipedia has this to say:\n\"Slavery in the United States was a form of unfree labor which existed as a legal institution in North America for more than a century before the founding of the United States in 1776, and continued mostly in the South until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.[1] The first English colony in North America, Virginia, first imported Africans in 1619, a practice earlier established in the Spanish colonies as early as the 1560s.[2] Most slaves were black and were held by whites, although some Native Americans and free blacks also held slaves; there were a small number of white slaves as well.[3]\"\n Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Award for Fiction, The Known World is one of the most memorable reads I had this year. It is not an easy book to read. This 388-page novel left me with a heavy chest each time I closed the book. Each page is gloomy and sad. The novel is well-told with lyrical prose creating a big canvas of imagery in one's mind while reading. In that big canvas are memorable and three-dimensional numerous characters most of them black slaves. No character is downright bad or good. The detailed description of the sceneries of a fictional county called Manchester and the true depictions of the characters are exceptionally striking that I had to slow down in my reading to savor the story and hold on *tugging to them, cheering them on* to each characters. Reading the last page left me with a heavy heart. I would not want to let go of that image of Manchester and say goodbye Please don't go yet to the characters that I already became part of my literary world. The world that resides in the recesses of my brain. The world that is known only to me populated by people who I met only in my readings. In terms of writing, Jones extensively use the technique called prolepsis that I first encountered reading Muriel Sparks' The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Jones explained this in the interview (appendix of the book) saying that he is the God of those characters so he knows what happened in the life of each characters from the time he/she was born up to the time his/her death. The most moving example of this use was with the character of the child Tessie. One fine day of September 1855, their mistress Caldonia saw the 5-y/o Tessie playing with a wooden toy horse. Caldonia says to the child: That is very nice, Tessie to which Tessie responded, My papa did this for me. In January 2002, on her deathbed, the old Tessie asked her caretaker to get the wooden toy horse from the attic. While holding the toy, she breathed her last saying the same thing: My papa did this for me. My heart stopped beating. Tears welled up in my eyes. That scene is just one of the many moving scenes about those slaves in that time of the history in Virginia when black people were traded like they were not human but properties.I can make this review very long. There are just too many good things I would like to say here but I am afraid that no review can make justice to a book as good as this.", "There is probably an important and interesting story in here somewhere (for example, if it were actually about the widow of a black slave owner trying to run a plantation after her husband's death, as claimed on the book jacket). However, any plot that might exist was buried so deep beneath the convoluted chronology and extraneous characters and details that I decided I didn't care to keep digging for it, and quit on page 198. The author seemed determined to insert every existing anecdote about slavery into one novel. This might have worked better as a compilation of essays or short stories.", "Basically - a book about slavery in the South. I enjoy those kind of thing, especially The Secret Lives of Bees, but with this one, it felt like the book had no point. While I was reading, I kept on going \"what did I just read? Am I really reading/understanding this book?\" and kept on referring to the back cover of the book. No. The story was simply what I read. O.......K! Then ugh. I HATE leaving a book unread, so I kept on forcing myself to read thru the whole book. Finally the misery I was putting myself through ended, and UGH! The storyline. The author kept on jumping around the timeline too much - and honestly - I would describe this book as a glimpse of the lives of slaves in the south, but with a blah storyline. However this book has won a pultizer prize. EH!? Anyone out there who has read this book? Your opinions??However like always, we learn from books. What I got out of this book was a new knowledge I never came upon, that black people owned black slaves.They even buy their own family members, and the slaves were considered as properties, including family. Hmm... History is richier than we will ever know or think of.", "Despite some luminous moments where the characters come alive in a special way, this novel about the lives of slaves in a fictional community in Virginia of the 1830s felt too hermetic and sealed off for me to enjoy it as thoroughly as others might.The special hook that the story holds is its rendering of freed blacks who became slave owners themselves. The focus is on one such plantation with about 30 slaves which is struggling to adapt to the death of its black master, Henry Townsend. We get a plausible history along the way of how his father, Augustus, was so talented at furniture making that he bought his own freedom, and state legislative action allowed him to continue residing in the state and eventually bought the freedom of his son. With other free blacks, such as the feisty, condescending teacher Fern, who came from the North, they form a small society of their own. While Augustus abhors slavery, his son tries to emulate the path taken by the whites to economic success by owning slaves. Despite an ambition to become a benevolent master, the corrupting influence of owning people as property is well portrayed. When his lonely widow takes up a love relationship with her plantation foreman, she is replicating the same abuse of power enacted by most other white plantation owners, and the consequences are tragic. The \u201cknown world\u201d of plantation life in this fictional county is like an island in time, and the characters themselves seem stuck in it like insects in amber. The omniscient narrator is god-like in passing into the thoughts and dreams of more than a dozen characters. Unfortunately, the reader gets distanced from emotionally connecting to them by the narrator breaking the flow to leap backward and forward in time to reveal some particular fact or person\u2019s fate (for more see: D.D. Wood review). Ultimately, the human bonds holding people to each other came off as tenuous and unreal as beholding a ship in a bottle. Unlike the romanticized lives portrayed in Hailey\u2019s \u201cRoots\u201d, the characters have no sense of cultural history of their African origins (the word itself appears nowhere in the book), and there is no foreshadowing of plantation life as a doomed phase in history on the path to the Civil War. The idea of a slave revolt is unthinkable, and the one humane white character, Sheriff Skiffington, feels no compunction over diligently carrying out a big part of his job in organizing night patrols and retrieval efforts when \u201cproperty\u201d runs away. Though we get no sense of the reality of the \u201cUnderground Railroad\u201d, we do get a brilliant vision at one point where Augustus ends up mailing a slave girl to Philadelphia in a crate along with a shipment of his hand-carved walking sticks.In an interview with Jones appended to the audiobook version of the novel, he admits he did not do much research for the book and was not concerned about communicating any particular message to his readers about the history of slavery. As the creator of all the characters, he would not admit to favoring any one character over another. Still the reader can\u2019t help but getting the message of how inhumane slavery was and how individuals trapped in it strived to achieve some form of dignity in their lives. Like other reviewers, I didn\u2019t feel I got to know any of the characters well enough to get emotionally engaged with them. When not interrupted by invasions from the narrator, the prose is effective in evoking the place and time, an obvious factor in helping it gain a Pulitzer Prize. Here is a lovely example from the opening for the book:The evening his master dies he worked again well after he ended the day for the other adults, his own wife among them, and sent them back with hunger and tiredness to their cabins. The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in a few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. \u2026he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because eating it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life.", "A knockout!

If you don't believe me, consider what he did with flood control on the Red and Atchafalaya rivers in Louisiana, the latter a distributary of the Mississippi, in one of the chapters here. (It's pretty scary, too: without browbeating us, McPhee makes us realize that those who would \"control nature\" are in danger of having nature unexpectedly seize that control right back.) If you want to witness some really fine writing, and along the way learn about things you never realized were so important, pick up THE SECOND JOHN McPHEE READER. If anything, it's better than the first!", "McPhee is one of my favorite authors -- especially for non-fiction -- and I have been enjoying his work for years in The New Yorker. This Reader consists of a collection of excerpts from certain of his essays and book-length works, and it is hit and miss. Some of the excerpts, such as the ones from Coming Into the Country, about Alaska, and La Place de la Concorde, about the Swiss Army (and, by extension, Switzerland), are by turns fascinating and incredible. Others, such as Giving Good Weight, while not particularly captivating as regards their storyline, are nonetheless vintage McPhee and are enjoyable if for no other reason than his inimitable style. But the excerpts taken from the geology books are just harder for me to get enthused about. I don't know what it is in particular about these excerpts, but they just don't come alive like so much of his work. I'm disinclined to chalk it up to subject matter, since he has revealed the interesting inner workings of many other apparently mundane subjects. But something's missing for these, it seems. If you're interested in reading McPhee at length elsewhere, I recommend Uncommon Carriers, Control of Nature, or The Headmaster.", "Serviceable reading, though this is just part one of the second reader. I think the geology extracts would have been more comprehensible with illustrations, since he uses a lot of technical language--but the parts about greenmarkets in NYC, the Swiss army, and the haute cuisine chef at work were entertaining and informative both. The extracts from COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, about Alaska and its natives and settlers, had some high spots too. McPhee's writing comes off as well in audio as it does on the page.Finished listening to part two of the second reader 6/1/16. Again, generally absorbing, particularly when he's talking about people. The one dud, to me, was the extract about the Loma Prieta earthquake--which was a long recitation of fragments of individual experiences....might be better on the page, but in audio it grew tedious after the first couple of dozen.", "One of my favorite all time authors of non fiction.

Great introduction by David Remnick, editor of the New York and a former student of McPhee at Princeton, puts the selections in context.", "John McPhee is a recent find for me.

This collection culls selections from many of his books. He surely is the only person I could think of that could write something interesting about being a green grocer.

The constant swarms of mosquitos and black flies alone would have done me in, not to mention the skunk and black bear encounters.....just to name a few.I really would have loved this story as a youngster and even enjoyed it as an oldster. Great \"children's\" adventure/survival story!", "I have to be honest. At first I was having a serious 'really?' moment as I started listening. The 'really?' was because this is a three-time Newberry Award winner, and I thought the prose was way too repetitive. The same word would be repeated three times. The same sentences twice. I was steeling myself to keep listening and hope it got better. It did. By the end of this novel, I totally realized why it is a Newberry Award winner.Hatchet is a story of survival. The protagonist is a thirteen-year-old city boy who ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot of the small plane he's flying in has a heart attack and dies. I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this kid. I think I would have freaked like nobody's business. He does freak out at first (and I don't blame him), but ultimately shows a fortitude that inspires awe in this reader. He goes from a scared, helpless boy to a survivor. The Brian that was has to be broken down and reassembled into a Brian that can survive his new reality. He learns how to meet his needs in the harsh wilderness, and he comes out of it forever changed. I love reading books/watching tv shows and movies about surviving. I don't know why, really. I don't even go camping or hiking, although I love the outdoors. I think it's because I love the idea of a person being resourceful and pitting their skills and mentality against the unprejudiced, often unsympathetic wild. Not conquering it, but learning to live in harmony, becoming a part of a vast ecosystem in a way that we can't do stuck in our comfortable city and surburban environs, another entity in the web of life. I would definitely recommend this book if you are of a similar mind.  I liked that Brian doesn't get it too easy. Not at all. He has to learn from his mistakes, and take the advantages that providence sends his way. He learns to keep food in his belly, to make a secure shelter, and to appreciate and anticipate the dangers of his environment. And in the process, he finds peace. He looks inside and finds his true self. That's what solitude and a oneness with nature will bring. I have always felt my most at peace in two places: in a spirit-filled church or by myself and with my heart open in prayer; and outside, surrounded by nature. So I really appreciated this aspect of the book. Brian starts out a boy who is emotionally lost at sea when his father and mother divorce, weighted down with the knowledge of his mother's infidelity; and finds that what seemed like tragedy and the end of his world will not conquer him. If he can survive the harsh elements of nature, all by himself, he can live with his family's fragmentation, and live to see the next day and the days after that. I think this book is a metaphor for life. Life is harsh and we have to grow and change to survive it. We can't give up, descend into pity, and expect to be saved. We have to be strong and fight to save ourselves, whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally.Although this book had a very shaky start, I do have to agree that this is a winner. And I tell you what, this young man had a lot of lessons to teach me, lessons he learns the hard way. That's the power of a good fiction novel for me.", "Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put it down. Obviously, as the class\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So, when a copy finally made it back to the book cubbies that lined the back of the classroom, I nabbed it. And I totally saw what the fuss was about.Survival stories have been popular for centuries. Robinson Crusoe, Kidnapped, The Swiss Family Robinson; even The Odyssey had survival aspects. So what was so special about Hatchet? It was the story of a thirteen-year-old plane-crash victim struggling to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Alone. With nothing but his hatchet.This was a main character who was close to our age. Who was struggling to accept the recent divorce of his parents, which was something that multiple kids in our class were going through, and that the rest of us feared. Who had absolutely none of the knowledge and skills seemingly necessary to make it in the wild. Like the rest of us. Seriously, what middle school kid would actually know what to do if they were dropped in the woods, alone, with no supplies and no tools except for a hatchet? If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re honest, most of us as adults would have no clue what to do, either. One thing about kids, though; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know enough yet to doubt their ability to survive anything. Kids believe that death doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply to them, and in some ways that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only way one could survive this type of dire situation.And survive Brian does. But Paulsen doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull punches; this is not a romanticized survival story, where food falls in the protagonist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lap and they never get so much as a blister. Brian gets put through the wringer. This poor child get severely sunburned, violently ill from bad fruit, attacked by various forest dwellers, and more. Not to mention the near starvation he is constantly battling. As a twelve-year-old, this book was terrifying and empowering and completely enthralling. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read it six more times since then, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still all of those things, with a healthy dose of nostalgia thrown in. So thanks, boys in my class, for getting me interested. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a parent, you should definitely get this book for your kids. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still a kid at heart and have never read this, track down a copy. You never know; the things you learn from this book could save your life if you ever get stranded alone in the middle of a forest.For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings.", "Despite some of the repetition getting annoying from time to time, Hatchet is an engrossing story of survival for a young boy unfortunate enough to endure a plane crash to become stranded in the Canadian wilderness. For the most part the story sticks to realistic stuff, concentrating mainly on hunger and food. So many other survival stories focus on more, but really the basics of food and hunger and survival would be the forefront issue most would encounter if stranded alone. It sets in fast and it's almost constant. Brian shows he has what it takes to survive, but the author doesn't make the child come across as anything super since he shows that nature is uncontrollable and that it's luck of the draw for us all. The author even ends the narrative of the story saying that if Brian had been unlucky enough to be stranded during wintertime in the Canadian wilderness, he very likely wouldn't have survived at all. His dependency on the lake is the only reason he made it past the first few days, and then subsequent months, but a frozen lake would have nixed that.\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough realistic with its focus on hunger and survival, it did have an unlikely tornado that felt contrived. Still the story can be forgiven this, as it focused on things like swarms of mosquitoes, baking sun, a random rude moose and other concerns. Brian didn't venture far from the landing, and I'm not sure I would have either. Some would venture far to try and find salvation themselves but he stuck to one area and stayed close to the shelter and food/water supply that were guaranteed to be sure. A more cautious method that worked. Not sure what I would have done in his circumstances, but I see the point that the chances of shelter like that would have been few and far between.\t\t\t\t\t\tWritten for children, it's more interesting and educational than upsetting. I do wish the author had spent more time granting us a deeper afterword. I realize the point of the story was the struggle, but I like to see more time involved with the after effect. Just a pet peeve of mine. We did get a small one at least. Besides the survival story being the focus, the Secret also weighed heavy in his mind, and ends up being a continuous thing he has to carry. The story ties into the Hatchet being the main tool he used to get started, but I do have to wonder why kind of random present that is that a mother gives a young boy. Either way, came in handy.\t\t\t\t\t\tEven if the repetition with the writer's style grew too much at times, it was to the point and paced well. I can see why it won so many children's awards, including Newberry Honor.", "basically, Biran is the main character in the story, he is getting on a plane to go visit his father; his parents are divorced. he also has a giant burden on his back, his mother was having an affair. before he leaves , his mother gives him a hatchet. after, he sets off, he talks with the pilot and has a little fun by piloting the airplane swerving and swoppoing up and down. until suddenly, the pilot has a heartattack becasue of gas and dies. brian is forced to fly the plane himself, but until the fuel runs out, he stops at a lake to kind of softne the impact.he wakes upon a beach. this starts him on his new journey, a journey to survive. this is kind of a rebirth for him; he learns to do things he would nt neccesarily do in life, but now that he has to, he is. he learns how to survive, he fends off cretures such as skinks, porcupines, bears, and mooses; he is able to be keep himself from starvation by findinf food among trees and the creatures of the wild such as fowls and rabbits and fish. he also creates his own shelter, fire,, his own weapons for hunting, a pond for which he keeps a stock of fish, and a list of things he makes so that his life is a little bit ore easier than it is in the wild( even though its not that easy in the first place). basically, one day, a tornado rips his location apart. he still survives, but when he goes outside, he sees that the plane he flew in was flipped up. he then figures out that there was a survival pack in the back of the plane; he goes and retireves it.after hard work, he ravages through the bag. he finds his own riches such as pots and pans, food, guns, radio which he immedialitey uses. he then feasts on packs of food and drink from the survival pack.until a plane comes and lands in the lake. he steps out and sees brian.the stroy ends with the epilouge wchich tells of brian and how he was the kid people had been looking for for over two months. how he had no fat in hsi body anymore and exploited the area in which he lived in and ws able to survive in.i really enjoyed this story. it seems like one of the stories that you know you can learn from if youre ever in brians situation. i know that if i was in the wilderness near a lake, i could proibably reenact his actions to survive; but id most defintiely need a hatchet, or he and i would naver ever be able to pull anything off. .....awesome story:)"], "The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide: Five Complete Novels and One Story (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1-5)": ["The universe is a joke. Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demnading the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.It's just is a joke, but only some of us are in on it.", "Just as funny as advertised, but I made the mistake of reading the collection of all five novels, and - what's more - trying to read them all in one go. Once I got about halfway through Life, the Universe, and Everything, it had stopped being funny and had gotten a little confusing. Adams is excellent at humor, not so much at plot.So, for clarification: 5 stars for the original Hitchhiker's, 4 for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and 3 stars for the others.", "OK. Where do I start with this one. It's a doozy.Let's first of all say that I think this is one of the best uses of the English language. It's right up there with, well, anything else. I mean, just read the sentences. He is a lot like Tolkien, in that he makes the words themselves the art. But where Tolkien will take English and make it into a lush, broad canvas, Mr. Adams turns English into a plaything. Let's put my last sentence another way: The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is the literary equivalent of juggling chainsaws. You read it through the first time, and you have no freaking clue how he did that with those words. OK, we got that out of the way. How bout the story now? Sure, that sounds good, Nick.There is no plot. For all of you who need one, I'm very very sory. But frankly, it's better that way. Life doesn't have a plot, right? You just sort of muddle through your week doing the best you can with what Life can throw at you. Well, that's the point with this. He takes the most regular guy, the guy you'd like to hang out with, someone decent that you can introduce to your sister. And then Adams throws him out into space and just sees what happens.Certain parts of this book, especially at the beginning, are an adaptation of the BBC Radio programme aired in 1977, which was also written by Douglas Adams. And he wrote H2G2 episodically, but also with no clear goal in mind. So when his characters come to a problem, Adams had no idea what would happen to them until he wrote the solution. Some rather large pieces of the story stuck in H2G2 this way. This is most true in the earlier books in the Trilgy (yes, it's five books in a series; The trilogy is inaccurately named), when the writing is fresher and better.But the best part of H2G2 (and all of DNA's books, frankly, even Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency) is his worldview. Basically, it's all about taking what life gives you with patience, humor, and tea. Yes, he was an Atheist (Yes, I'm a Christian whose favorite thinker/writer/guy was an Atheist. Calm down, calm down.), and he disliked people using ideas and beliefs as a crutch. This is the part where it's hard to really write a coherent review for me, because so many loved ones of mine (hi Mom and Dad) would see this as a Very Bad Idea. So why don't you shoot me an email, and we can have a discussion about it? Maybe sit down, and have some coffee and some nice nosh and chat? You'll get more and better ideas out of me that way. Anyways, I've just lost my train of thought, so I'll just say you'll love the part about the Vogon poetry. And H2G2 is an inaccurately named trilogy, because it is composed of five books. I recommend reading them all at once, even though there's no plot and things in one book will sometimes contradict things in another. Anyways, this trilogy is still one of my favorites.", "So my journey with The Ultimate Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Galaxy finally came to an end. What an enjoyable journey it was! The characters, the stories, the writing and the essence of Douglas Adam\u2019s work \u2013 it was fantastic!!!I had heard a lot about this cult series and finally got to read it \u2013 thanks to a friend. A very big thank you to you indeed!This book contains the entire Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Galaxy series by Douglas Adams i.e. 5 novels and 1 story:1.\tThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 2.\tThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe 3.\tLife, the Universe and Everything 4.\tSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish5.\tMostly Harmless6.\tYoung Zaphod Plays It Safe (story)There is a sixth novel - And Another Thing... by Eoin Colfer also. I shall see if I can get hold of it.The foreword by Neil Gaiman was pretty informative. I was indeed thrilled to learn that Adams had been influenced by P G Wodehouse himself. I knew that I was in for a big treat.I don\u2019t have to say it \u2013 but what a skilled storyteller Adams was! That too, as Gaiman says in the foreword, when he did not enjoy the task of writing!So much has been written about this cult series that I wonder if I should write a review! Instead of writing a review for each book, I will write about the series in general and try to convince you why you should give it a try.I am sure you are aware of it, but still I will say that the series is a sci-fi comedy. Hats off to the author\u2019s imagination \u2013 what technologies he had imagined, and of course to his writing \u2013 I always loved clever use of language and Adams, in my humble opinion, is a master of the craft.First of all, let me tell you about the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Galaxy. As the name suggests it is a guide for people or rather aliens who hitchhike their way through the galaxy and comes in the form of an electronic book. The said book resembles  a largish electronic calculator  and on its four inches square  screen any one of its million pages could be  summoned at a moment\u2019s notice. This reminds of you of Kindle right?This is a science fiction book and it has its share of outrageous technologies, alien races, space travel, time travel and whatnot! If you can see beyond the aliens and spaceships, then you would see the brilliance of the stories. The behavior and thoughts of the aliens actually portray the various human foibles. The stories would let accompany the wonderful if somewhat eccentric characters like Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod, Trillian, Marvin among others on their adventures through space and time. There is action, suspense, drama and the best of all \u2013 the famous wit of Douglas Adams. That man could make fun of almost anything \u2013 philosophers, scientists, political leaders, party-lovers, warmongers, bureaucrats, unions, marketing professionals, corporate and even God himself. There are brilliant dialogues and statements. I thought of including some but later decided that it would be better if you discover them on your own.Oh! Did I tell you about the Question and Answer to the Life, Universe and Everything! When I read about God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation, I was floored.Through his ridiculous creations the author has actually said the ultimate thing about life. I better stop before I give away spoilers!Highly recommended for people who love sci-fi. You guys have probably read it by now.If you are not into science fiction, then I would suggest that you try the first book in the series - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then decide if you want to proceed further.", "It's that book you pick up and feel obligated to love, if only to escape grievous fan persecution. Well. Here goes. Let's start with the humour. Yes, it's everything that humour should be. For a while, you are oh-so-amused and impressed...but then you weary of being so amused. Akin to being kept on the edge of your seat for a good few hours - something's going to get sore. It's just such a strain. I skipped ten or so pages near the middle but I'm sure those ten pages were, like the rest of the book, terribly witty and sickeningly clever.The plot takes twists like...ah, what's a good analogy? A snake on LSD? That'll do. Don't get me wrong, they're good twists and Adams is admittedly superb at making the inherently illogical seem orderly and precise, but they just don't stop coming. And after a while, the worst happens and the reader just stops caring. I can see why this book has achieved its cult status. It deserves its cult status in many ways. There are moments of startling originality that knock you back and spin your world to a crazy new angle, but when the whole book is all but filled with these moments, the crazy new angle begins to make you dizzy and irritated. At the end, I'm still feeling oh-so-amused and impressed, but also oh-so-relieved I can stop.", "I definitely am overdue to reread this comic scifi classic! I remember laughing all the time at the quirky universe that Adams conjured up, but admit to have forgotten many of the details...on my 2018 TBR!", "I first read what was then the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy in high school. I remember sitting on the bleachers in the gym reading while other people played volleyball or some other indoor sport and being swept away on a rollicking ride across the universe, and even to its end.

Darkness covered the land. The latest winter storm, which by then had already lasted half a century, still showed no sign of ending. The cold and the snow were beginning to wear the proud Alaskans down. Then Russia invaded. Again. The fledgling state was unprepared for war, and so the Alaskan Militia fell back before the forces of the Dark Lord Stalin, and the Red Army of Moscow reached the walls of Juneau. For two days and nights the city was bombarded by communist orcs. On February 11, 1964, the third day of the seige, a light appeared on the horizon. It was the sun! After fifty years of endless night, dawn finally broke over Alaska! Rousing the defenders, the mighty wizard Ted Stevens the White led the final charge and drove the Red Army into the sea. Alaska won the day.Ten years passed.In the early 70s, the Prophet McPhee came to Alaska. He had had visions since the Great Dawn, terrible, awe-inspiring visions of a woman in red riding a war-grizzly. The priests he spoke to all agreed: it was the Mother of Grizzlies, Daughter of Alaska, the great Messiah-Queen of the prophecies who would restore the mighty Alaskan Empire to glory and lead Her armies out of the North to conquer the Lower 48. The Return of the Sun had marked the hour of Her birth, but none had seen sign of Her since. And so the Prophet McPhee vowed to find Her. Assembling a party of shamen, slaves (bearing gifts of gold, jewels, and newspapers), and mages from the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the Department of Fish and Game, and other government agencies, McPhee set out into the widerness. Questions arose: was the Mother of Grizzlies also Daughter of Grizzlies, or was She merely a feral child, raised and educated in the ways of the bear? Would they find Her feasting on fish and berries, or did She hibernate in the caves of bears, sleeping until Alaska needed a savior? Russia had been silent for many years, but would surely invade again. The expedition failed; most of the party was eaten by wolves or lost in skirmishes with the National Park Service, so they returned to Juneau. It was clear that, wherever the Queen of Alaska was, She would not reveal Herself until the time was right. So Alaska waited, and prepared. And the question was asked: where would Her Capital be? Juneau was not grand enough, and Anchorage and Fairbanks still lay in ruins from the war, so the Prophet McPhee again set out into the wilderness, again with his shamen and slaves and government bureaucrats, to find a suitable place to build Her Palace. And again the shamen were eaten by wolves, and the bureaucrats bickered, and the slaves revolted, so McPhee went back to Juneau.The quest seemed hopeless. McPhee had not found the Chosen One or built Her City, and all his shamen were dead. But, inspired by rumors of a secret messiah breeding program, he set off alone, on a third expedition, following the elusive trail of a powerful sisterhood of sorceress-nuns. Here the narrative grows sketchy, as McPhee\u2019s accounts of interviews of dozens of gold miners, hermits, holy men, ice-mages, and the occasional talking bear led him in dizzying circles, endlessly searching for a treasure that chose to remain secret. McPhee apparently never found the Mother of Grizzlies, and left Alaska in disgrace. There are rumors, however, that he drank himself to death, only to be resurrected by an unidentified hirsute girl, but those stories remain unverified. Even McPhee\u2019s account must be questioned. Were his visions true? Did he truly foresee the birth and rise of Alaska\u2019s savior? If so, She remains hidden, and perhaps none will know the hour of Her coming. Where is the bear and the rider? Where is the voice that is grating? IA! IA! SARAH PALIN FHTAGN!", "Things I learned about Alaska:-- Merrill Field, a light-plane airfield in Anchorage, handles fifty-four thousand more flights per year than Newark International.

I'll go along with the Indians that far.\"Everyone aboard was white but Willie (William Igiagruq Hensley), of Arctic Alaska, and he said again, \"Denali. What the hell did McKinley ever do?I learned the difference between a visitor and a tourist in Alaska: A tourist stays a week and drops four hundred dollars. A visitor comes with a shirt and a twenty-dollar bill and doesn't change either one.I learned that Alaska is a great place for nicknames: Pete the Pig, Pistolgrip Jim, Groundsluice Bill, Coolgardie Smith, Codfish Tom, Doc LaBooze, the Evaporated Kid, Fisty McDonald, John the Baptist, Cheeseham Sam, and the Man with the Big Nugget. I actually came across a Codfish in my own travels, but I have an odd job.I learned that bear scat is \"fairly, but not acutely fresh\" when it \"glistens but has stopped smoking.\" Not everything I learned will I actually use.I learned that Alaska, at least the Alaska of 1977, was a place where people, tired of government and other people, fled to. I learned that the government followed them there and refused to let them alone. I learned that Alaskans are prone to a philosophy: LIVE EACH DAY SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK EVERY DAMN MAN IN THE EYE AND TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL.We need such people. At least we need a place where such people could go. A place I might go if it wasn't so cold. A place so vast and unpeopled that if anyone could figure out how to steal Italy, Alaska would be a place to hide it.This was another wonderful trip that John McPhee took me on. It's dated, to be sure. But wonderful characters are portrayed; good stories told. In the battle between independent, brave individuals and a pedantic, fuzzy-wuzzy government, John McPhee leaves no doubt whose side he is on.", "I was really hoping this would be about geology, along the lines of Basin and Range. It wasn't. It's divided into three sections; in the first, McPhee wanders around unpopulated Alaska with several other men in several canoes/kayaks. I think one was from the Sierra Club, one from the Bureau of Land Management, etc. They fished to supplement their food supplies, and camped along the rivers and streams. The second section was about the attempt to get Alaska's capital moved from Juneau. I now know more about this issue than I ever wanted to. At the end of the section it really sounded like the move was going to come off; people voted and wanted the capital moved to Willow. (This was written in 1977.) But a check of the primary authority on such matters, Wikipedia, shows that Juneau is still the capital, so McPhee must have been stoned or something when he wrote that sentence.In the third section McPhee moved to Eagle, a teeny tiny town on the Yukon River, and pretty much just interviewed the residents of Eagle and told us their stories. Some are interesting; some aren't. (The 2010 census showed the population of Eagle as 86.)In spite of the need for women to be tough in the wilds of Alaska, there are no women's libbers here. The women do all the cookin' and much, much more; wood choppin', skinnin' of critters, waitin' for the menfolk to come a-home from their trips.Maybe a few people sound relatively sane, but most sound a bit crazy. Or a lot crazy. There are your Cliven Bundy types up there. They don't like the people of the lower 48 dictating the rules in Alaska. Alaska is different. People of Alaska, hear me: Alaska is not different. It is a state that in many respects is qualitatively different from, say, Connecticut. It is not legally, Constitutionally, different. Because you build a cabin on a plot of land, trap and hunt your own critters for food, bulldoze yourself a gravel landing strip for your little plane, it does not follow that you now own that land. Don't get all uppity when the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell you you don't actually own that land. You know how I know I own my home? Because I wrote a check; the bank agreed to supply the rest; we had a ceremony (with lawyers for both sides) where we all signed many sheets of paper; and at the end of it one of these sheets of paper was the title and deed to my home. Plus I pay real estate taxes on this home. If the Bureau of Land Management comes to tell me I don't own my home, then we have a problem. You, Alaska trapper and fisher with no title to your little cabin, you don't have a problem.McPhee's writing style wears thin. This was 438 pages of it.", "A year or two out of college I was employed at a bookshop in Seattle, earning little more than minimum wage. For a change of scene, I signed up with some friends to work the salmon season at a cannery in Alaska. It was rough work, seven days a week, 8am to 11pm (or to 1am on nights when you had cleanup duty). We didn\u2019t get to see much of \u201creal Alaska,\u201d but you could feel it around you. The wilderness. The cannery was located on an island in the southeast of the state. The town was small for anyplace other than Alaska, with not much more than a single road. The rest of the island was uninhabited. People wandering into the interior were sometimes never heard from again. No one went in search of them. It was assumed the wolves or bears had got them. The moss and muskeg would hide their bones.Though I saw little of Alaska, it was enough to grasp its fascination. If my sense of it had faded some over the past twenty years, McPhee\u2019s wonderful book has helped to revive it. I suddenly find myself scheming ways to get the wife and kids up north on vacation as soon as possible.One of my college professors first introduced me to John McPhee. It was a writing course, and he was reading brief passages from one of McPhee\u2019s books (I don\u2019t recall which one), lingering over certain passages and expostulating on the genius of his prose, his crystalline expressions. McPhee is rarely flashy. There is no false posturing. He is curious, broad, but crisp, fresh, clear. My former favorite of McPhee\u2019s books (among those I have read) was Basin and Range, but Coming into the Country is just as good. The first part of it follows McPhee on an outing in the total wild of the Brooks Range. The second has to do with the politics of the state circa 1977. The third, and by far the longest, is the best. In it, McPhee lives with and among the trappers, the miners, the townspeople, the hippie kids and the Athapaskan natives of the Yukon River country near the Canadian border.In this small but broadly scattered and loose-knit community, McPhee finds all the hope, discontent and anxiety of the human condition. It\u2019s a parable (perhaps) of the riddling complexities that face us today, finding ourselves to be a part of the natural order and yet standing, somehow, outside of it.", "This book has meant a lot to me as an Alaskan interested in the raggedy interplay between development and conservationism, although I had never read it in its entirety. Now I have. I would say this book at best offers a kind, sympathetic view of all sorts of Alaskans circa 1977, a period which I just barely remember from grade school. I still recall the statewide debate on whether to give \"Mount McKinley\" the new/old name of \"Denali\" as part of ANILCA, then called the D-2 Lands Bill, which was a hot-button topic (i.e. federal take-over) for Alaskans such as my parents. I remember the debate to move the capital to Willow. I remember John Denver's goodwill trip to Alaska to promote conservation and the passage of ANILCA. It was all HIGHLY charged politics in which the feds were dabbling, playing, frivolizing with OUR land. The outgrowth of both the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act are INCREDIBLY far reaching with regards to living and working in Alaska today. In that respect, the first two chapters of the book are now dated and rather nostalgic, kind of a time-capsule of what was going on while these landmark Congressional laws were being sussed out.The chapter \"Coming Into The Country\" (nearly half of the book) on the Yukon River/Charley River area of Interior Alaska was by far the best part of the book, focusing on the communities of Central, Circle, and Eagle and the idealistic, sometimes hard-nosed characters that live there. Although McPhee, in what I've read, was an impressionable young man leaning to the side of environmental conservation at the expense of economic development, I think his writing in this book shows both a reverence for Alaska's brand of wilderness (in a word, awesome) as well as a sympathetic, humane perspective on the toll that Congressional protectionism, environmental regulation, and romantic idealism has on the lives of real families living in \"the country\". (The best writing is the transcription of journal entries made by a young man, Rich Corazza, living alone in a cabin somewhere around Eagle. This section is one third into the last section \"Coming Into The Country\" and made me grin and laugh out loud. A true seeker with a good dose of humor and longing.)", "McPhee's Coming Into the Country is rightly considered a classic with its detailed description on life in mid-1970s Alaska. Much of the writing is stunning, packed full of river trips and anecdotes about characters the author encountered during his many months in the country. He captures well the contradictions embodied in many Alaskans: a thirst for solitude alternating with a an affinity for social gatherings, an abhorrence of government even as they live and trap on public land, and the sparse population combined with a sense that there are few places left to go, live, and be free. McPhee's writing style full of rapid fire quotes summing up various points of view is effective in conveying these contradictions. He also captures an important transitional time in the state's history when the Trans-Alaskan oil pipeline and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act were new realities. Read nearly 40 years after it was published, I believe the book reflects an important historical slice of Alaskan culture.Despite the overall high quality of writing, I found that some parts dragged (I found myself skimming dozens of pages related to a possible shift of Alaska's capital city from Juneau to parts unknown). If 4.5 stars were possible, that is what it would receive from me.", "This book was a challenge for me. McPhee divided his exploration of Alaska into three sections--the first, stage-setting section on the northern tree line; the second, uses the search for an ideal site for a new state capital to explore urban Alaska; and the final section, on \"the bush,\" really focuses on the motives and lifestyles of in-migrants to the state. I breezed through the first two parts; the relocation of the state capital (which never happened) in particular was literally a bird's eye view of Alaskan cities and their inhabitants. The third part, however, desperately needed editing: descriptions of grizzly dangers, gold-sluicing methods, and conflicts among resource-hungry and cabin-fevered Yukon inhabitants became monotonous and overly repetitive. McPhee clearly became enamored of the rugged individualists who chose to leave the Lower Forty-eight behind to build lives based on subsistence and skills-building. While his book does not gloss over their less admirable qualities--a tendency toward paranoia, chaos, alchoholism, and particularly misogyny--he comes down firmly for their willingness to pit themselves against nature. Surveying the environmental effects of one gold-mining team's efforts, he writes, \"This pretty little stream is being disassembled in the name of gold.... Am I disgusted? Manifestly not.... This mine is a cork on the sea. Meanwhile (and, possibly more seriously), the relationship between this father and son is as attractive as anything I have seen in Alaska--both of them self-reliant beyond the usual reach of the term, the characteristic formed by this country.\" (410) This celebration of masculine triumph over nature is nothing new, and is disappointing from a writer who can be such a subtle thinker.", "I love McPhee's writing. I first read this book when it was published in part in the New Yorker, and again soon after it was published as a book. So this is the third time I've read it. I've read maybe ten books three times, so I really, really like this.First, because McPhee writes so beautifully. He could write about anything and I would read it. I've even read his geology books. Not because I like geology, (I don't), but because I just eat up his words. It is like eating chocolate, I usually stop when the supply runs out, not because I'm finished.Second, the people and the spirit that makes up Alaska. Everything is so unbelievably huge. I love the stories about people who cut tractors up into pieces, fly them to remote regions, weld them back together so they can build an airstrip for a bigger plane.Third, the Alaska he writes about was disappearing when he wrote it, and has been replaced with at least two generations of Alaska since then. I will be visiting Alaska this summer and I am looking forward to seeing what's new and what remains of the old. Will it be strip malls? I'll let you know.", "John McPhee is one of my journalistic heroes. I read him obsessively when I was younger and yearning to become a journalist myself. This book, about Alaska, is perhaps my favorite, or at least the one I'd recommend to someone who has never read McPhee before. These days, when everyone seems to have a severely truncated attention span, perhaps McPhee can seem a touch long-winded, but I completely disagree -- I don't think he wastes a sentence. He does write in a pre-internet way, and that, in my opinion, is nothing but good. Read him on paper, not an e-reader, if possible. Even better, take this book in your backpack and head up to Alaska. Perhaps take the public ferry there, out of Bellingham, Washington. It's extremely reasonable. Bring a sleeping bag and sleep on the sundeck, saving your money. You see the same sights as the most expensive cruise ships in the world, and you'll meet some amazing people. Read \"Coming into the Country\" at night. See the northern lights. Feel goosebumps all over. Change your life forever. That's what I did, and I haven't regretted it for a moment.", "The Country lies around the upper Yukon River. The book induced aching for it. This one work teaches more about Alaska than any other source I know: Statehood demeaned Alaska, the Native Claims Settlement Act made a well-intentioned wreck, and the pipeline contorted it in good and bad ways that will prove insignificant over time. Most of all, the book made clear how painful the federal government's interference is to \"whites and Indians alike\" of The Country."], "The Changeling (Daughters of England, #15)": ["Fifteenth in the Daughters of England historical fiction series in the gothic romance vein. The focus in this one is on a Victorian-era daughter, Rebecca Mandeville and her family.My TakeA typical gothic romance with cozy overtones that thwart Carr's attempts to create tension and drama. I'm not sure if my frustration with this is due to how long ago this story was first released and the silly tropes used in this were typical of the writing styles when this was written or if this was an aberration. I know I liked Victoria Holt, one of Carr's pseudonym's, when I was a kid. That said, the protagonist, Rebecca, annoyed the hell out of me. She's such a snot. Granted, she has reason for her unhappiness, but even as she grows, she doesn't acknowledge how unfair she's been, although she's quite keen to disparage others for doing exactly what she's doing. She is so incredibly clueless\u2026 And I thought this was the Victorian era when single women couldn't go anywhere unattended? Rebecca goes EVERYwhere unattended. Including into some very dubious establishments. What is Rebecca, or should I say, what is Carr thinking?I'm confused. If Angelet and her husband went to Australia to make it big and come back to England to live in comfort, how has she managed her current comfort if he died there? Then there's Benedict's marriage to Celeste. Supposedly he needs a wife who can hostess dinners, etc. for this upcoming and brilliant politician. And she can barely speak English. How does this make her an asset?That penultimate scene between Pedrek and her\u2026MAJOR eye roll there. I mean, duhhhh, all, and I mean ALL, the evidence is right in front of her and she's too stupid to make the connections??? Give. Me. A. Break. I thought she was supposed to be intelligent. The scene with Jacque-Philip at Tor Hill? Puh-lease. How naive can she be? Personally, I'd've leaped to the conclusion that the attacker was him way before anyone else!Tragedy, drama, whining, the stupid trope, it's all here. The ending was happy enough, and much too easy.The StoryIt\u2019s so romantic that Angelet and Benedict are free to marry each other, having been childhood sweethearts separated by events. They\u2019re so incredibly happy with only one fly in the ointment: Rebecca hates her new stepfather for taking the place of the father she never knew.When Angelet becomes pregnant, Rebecca looks forward to her new brother or sister arriving. What no one anticipates is how hard the birth is. And Benedict is like Sir Ronald, unforgiving. It\u2019s a pair they are, two people hating in a family with a newborn.A few years later, disaster strikes at Christmas, and Lucie loses her mother tragically. Luckily, Rebecca and her grandparents are kindly people and take Lucie in. Lucky in so many ways\u2026The CharactersRebecca is Angelet's beloved daughter. Angelet Mandeville lost her husband during a rescue attempt in Australia. Now she lives in London with her daughter and visits her grandparents often at Cador, their house in Cornwall.

They have two children, twins: Jacco and Anne-Mary. Mrs. Garnett is the cook at Cador. Jim Isaacs and Stubbs are two of the grooms. Dr. Wilmington is the family doctor. Madge is a new kitchen maid with a loose tongue.Pedrek Cartwright is Rebecca's best friend \u2014 they were born in the same house out in Australia. His grandparents, Josiah Pencarron and his wife, own a mine near Rebecca's grandparents' home in Cornwall. Justin and Morwenna Cartwright are Pedrek's parents who live in London.Benedict Lansdon is the grandson of \"Uncle\" Peter, a great friend of Rebecca's family. Amaryllis is Peter's wife. Peterkin is their son, and he works with his wife, Frances, at the Mission his father established. Helena is Peter and Amaryliss' daughter and is married to a politician, Martin Hume. I'm not sure where Grace Hume fits in, other than she's worked closely with Benedict at some point besides working at the Mission. The wealthy Lizzie Morley was Benedict's first wife. Celeste Bourdon will become his third. Yvette is her lady's maid.Oliver Gerson is a charming business colleague of Benedict's whom he inherited when Uncle Peter's businesses came to him. Tom Marner is an Australian mine owner and colleague who visits Benedict at Manorleigh.In CornwallJenny Stubbs is a young woman who lost a child she cared for and so lost a bit of her mind as well. She becomes pregnant with Lucie. She works for the kindly Mrs. Bullet and, I guess, Mrs. Granger. Mrs. Polhenny is an excellent midwife and vituperative religious nut job. Leah is her much-abused daughter who does beautiful embroidery. The Bourdons are French \u00e9migr\u00e9s who will buy High Tor. Celeste is the daughter; the licentious Jean Pascal is the son. The Stennings are the latest tenants of High Tor.Madame Perrotte is teaching Rebecca to curtsy for her presentation. Jack Kellaway worked for Josiah and was injured in a mining accident. A tragedy left his wife, Mary, and daughter, Mary, alone. The CoverThe cover is gothic enough with its woods and the tightly buttoned-up Rebecca sitting on the stone bench with her letter and the mysterious gentleman in the background. With all that orange on the ground, I\u2019m tempted to say it\u2019s autumn, but the trees still have their leaves.The title is where it ends up, with The Changeling. A rather obvious one.", "The Changeling is not a mystery, nor is it a good historical novel, both of which are genres I love. Instead it is a stereotypical romance novel that just happens to be set in Victorian England. The author dropped a couple of names (Disraeli and Gladstone)and describes the Queen (in passing) as \"a diminutive figure with an expression of gloom and an air of aloofness which was rather disconcerting.\" But this was not enough to truly leave the reader with a sense of the time or place in which the story was set.Mystery? No mystery here. Read the title. Story? Read the jacket fly leaf and save yourself time. If you really like Harlequin Romances, you will probably like The Changeling. I do not and I did not.", "One of my favorite books from high school, this is the story of childhood sweethearts from Cornwall, a suitably dramatic setting for this gothic tale! This book has everything: deaths, ghosts, babies switched at birth, ravishments in old castles . . . and yet it's all very demurely done. I liked that quite a bit, it was very reminiscent of something like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Affairs and other scandalous matters were spoken of with veiled comments and euphemisms that were in keeping with the time period. The mysteries (there are a couple) are well done, as are the romances (there are a couple of those, too).", "*** \"The Changeling\" by Philippa Carr aka Victoria Holt is an old-fashioned kiss-less romance in Victorian England, entangled in servant gossip and rising political ambition, with children and adults who can behave both well and ill. I had heard of Rebecca de Mandeville, but mistakenly connected with the story called Rebecca. Becca is born in Australia in the same fine house as Pedrek, and when her father dies saving his in a mine accident, both grow up in Cornwall, childhood sweethearts. I do not think I have read the story before, just that the author leaves pointed clues so we are ahead of the characters to decipher a mysterious adoption, attack, and disappearance.", "Part of a series of mother to daughter generations stories telling the history of England from Henry VIII to WW II. Fabulous to read them all in order. Each one is a gem; each is surprising and well written.This reflects a bit of the eerie feeling that Victoria Holt is famous for; Phillipa Carr is another pen name.", "** spoiler alert **\n           I love the daughters of England series but I just did not like this book. I think Philippa Carr missed the mark on this one. The historical info she usually writes about wasn't there, and I missed reading about family members from previous books growing old and the mature knowledge they provide. The death of her mother at the beginning of the book left me disappointed.", "Periodically, my weakness for authors that began in late teenage years erupts, and I have to read some of those novels! Just finished one from the paperback swap rack at the Carrollton library, \"The Changeling\", by Philippa Carr -- aka Victoria Holt. All right, I'll say the truth, I'd figured out the mysteriously veiled relationships well in advance! Shan't say anything more...", "Another excellent installment in the gothic romance world of Philippa Carr (aka Victoria Holt). Yet another well done twist (had my suspicions throughout the book, but was not sure till the end). Historically accurate and interesting read.", "I was all along expecting that Leah had a secret child with the Frenchman,and that this would be revealed at some point in the story, but not the swapping of the babies by the midwife!", "Your typical Victorian novel."], "What to Expect the First Year": ["Babies are definitely scary your first time. I mean there's this new little life that's counting on you get things right and if you screw it up they might die! No pressure though, right? Thank God our child came with instructions. Amazon claims that the book was published just like any other book but I swear it must have been hidden somewhere in the placenta. Because shortly after the birth of our baby, it appeared out of nowhere and it never left my wife's side until she finished it. The book was of course What to Expect the First Year and it really helped my wife out a lot. Generously, I allowed her the pleasure of reading through the 800 plus page baby bible. She sifted through it and passed along the important parts. I remember one day I was going to make my baby girl a snack then my wife says, \"You know not to give babies honey, right?\", from way off in our living room, in a tone suggesting that it was ridiculous for her even to mention it. She was laying on the couch reading the baby bible and watching our baby doing her tummy time. Our baby girl was just old enough to eat a sandwich. Peanut butter and grape jelly was her favorite food for the week. Standing in our kitchen pantry, wearing an expression as if I just bit into as lemon, I answered, \"Pffftt... of course, who doesn't?\", raising my voice to be heard across the distance while jerking my hand away from the bottle of honey I had been reaching for. \"Why is that again anyway? I- I forget.\" Asking nervously but trying to play it off as nonchalant as possible. \"Because of a spore of a bacterium called clostridium botulinum that could kill them\u2026,\" saying it as if she were stating a rather obvious and well known fact. Of course, now I felt as if I was a complete idiot. \u201c...that is at least until they\u2019re about one years old.\u201d \"Oh, that's right!\", came my reply, followed by a nervous laugh. Now staring at the honey, my face flushed and my nervous smile turned to a look of dread. \u2018Whoa, honey can kill a baby?\u2019 I thought. My heart almost stopped as it dawned on me, 'I almost killed my child'. I made as if to grab at the honey again, as a compulsive urge suddenly overcame me to take all our honey out and throw it into the street. I stopped short as, in horror, I glanced at a hateful bag of Honey-Nut-Cheerios. I let out a gasp when I saw the Honey Roasted Peanuts on the shelf below. I almost screamed when I turned to see the Honey BBQ sauce flanking me at my left. I was surrounded by baby death!With my heart racing, I grabbed the wheat bread and fled from the pantry. I shut the pantry door, leaning with my back to it as if the honey and its minions would try to force their way out. I felt as if my pantry should have a deadbolt on it to protect my child from the numerous dangers lurking from within. Catching my breath, I walked over to the fridge and fished out the strawberry jam. We had apparently just run out of her favorite grape jelly. As I regained my composure, I calmly began to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Shaking my head and letting out a sigh, I thought, 'What a terrible world we live in! So inhospitable to babies'. Within seconds of laying out the bread and opening the jar of strawberry jam, my wife walked into the kitchen. Stopping abruptly in her tracks, she glared down at the sandwich I was preparing. Grabbing the butter knife, I scooped a hefty portion of jam on the knife, making ready for an application to the bread. Then my wife stared at me with an incredulous expression. Holding the knife above the bread, I froze as if she was holding a gun to my head and just pulled back the hammer. Gingerly, as if any sudden movement would make her flinch and fire a round at me, I slowly returned her gaze. As if to escape the dreadful glare of my wife, a portion of the gelatinous strawberry jam slid off the knife, falling on the counter with a plop and missing the bread. 'She knows...' I thought in surprise as my eyes slowly widened. 'Somehow she knows I almost poisoned our child with the vicious honey!' That was moment I envied the retreating jam. With a guilty conscience and an expression looking as though I'd been caught cheating on her, I asked, \"Umm... wha-wha-what's wrong, honey?\" cringing at my choice of words.\"What do you think you're doing?\" she asked sternly, throwing her hands up in front of her, palms up, to emphasize the word 'doing'. \"Didn't you ask me to make our baby a sandwich? I mean a-a-a snack..?\"At this, she put her hands down and rested them on her hips while gaping at me, wide-eyed, as if she was shocked to be observing the world's dumbest person. Leaning forward slightly, she let out a frustrated sigh and said, \"Don't you know you can't give her strawberries? She might develop a rash or maybe even go into anaphylactic shock!\" At the word 'shock,' her right hand leapt from her hip and flew out in front of her and, to further stress her point, abruptly jerked her head slightly to the right.In response, I looked down at the evil strawberry jam covering the knife I held and dropped it on the counter, as if it become electrified by my wife's eyes. I could almost swear that I heard an evil suppressed laugh escape from deep within the jar. The label on the jar suddenly took on an ominous look to me by appearing to sneer at me sardonically. Even more nefarious dietary monsters were lurking in our very own kitchen! It was almost too much to believe! As if honey didn't have enough minions in its army, unbeknownst to me, it had many seasoned generals in its ranks too. I began to feel claustrophobic as if there was an army of devilish food closing in on me from all sides.\"And, by the way...\", my wife began again, \"that bread HAS HONEY IN IT!\"Epilogue: True story... well sort of. It didn't happen exactly that way, this is funnier. Real life inspired this. I do actually remember learning about honey and strawberries being problematic when she was only about three months old. I recall the feeling of horror at the discovery that I could have unwittingly killed her on several occasions, and I felt that she was lucky to still be alive. For the sake of accuracy, the bacteria in honey clostridium botulinum is actually quite rare in commercial honey these days and strawberries, while somewhat commonly causes rashes in some infants, is not usually life threatening and anaphylaxis is also rare. This is not all the book has to offer either, it\u2019s much more involved and goes way beyond diet. Thanks for reading!", "I read this because I liked What to Expect When You're Expecting.

I skimmed the chapters to become aware of what could happen, but I'd rather rely on advice from the pediatrician or medical staff in the event of serious sickness or injury.I found the section on baby sign language interesting because someone recently told me how she used sign language with her daughter, and it made communicating much less frustrating.NotesFeedingBottles\u2022 Introduce bottle around 5 weeks, after breastfeeding is established.

It's incredibly informative and a great guide for following the development of your baby during his first year of life.My rating isn't indicating anything wrong with this book. There's nothing wrong. It's perfect. But I found it to be more of a fun guide - like keeping track of milestones, excited to see which one's were on the mark, which needed improving and which he was 'excelling' at - than a lifesaver and any book after this, I'm 99% sure I won't bother with. The only reason this one even ended up in my paws is because I got it in great condition at my local Charity Sale for $.50 so *shrug*Overall, I would recommend this one but I won't shove it in someone's face like I might the first one. Because honestly, if the women in my life who had already raised their babes didn't, I would have ignored this series altogether. I thank those ladies and these books for getting me through my first year being a new mommy and helping me not accidentally kill begin the process of raising my little squish!", "Another manual that should come home from the hospital with the newborn! I devoured this book and have a lot of highlights! A must have for new moms and dads. Nicely laid out.I'm glad I got this book out of the shelf to add to GRs. I found a Mother's Day card to me inside it from my Grandmother! God rest her soul.", "***I will preface my review by saying that, apparently, my parenting style is referred to as \"Attachment Parenting\" which I understand is an institutional term for \"Damn Hippie\". I simply do what feels natural and right for me and my baby. I have learned to trust my baby, listen to her pediatrician (with a discerning ear), and phooey on anyone that tells me I HAVE to do X-Y-Z to make sure she scores high on the S-A-T. (seriously, if she doesn't eat solids at 120 days old, she will still learn to eat with a spoon!).If you are a control freak who thinks that nap times should be scheduled, or if Clorox is your BFF, than disregard everything I have said and will say in this book review***This book is like the sequel to a movie. The first was good (What to Expect When You're Expecting), but the second installment exists because the producers know it will sell at the box office, no matter how good (or not) it is.***Excepting, of course, \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\", which far exceeds its predecessor in every regard***This book has some well thought out advice and handy information for the first time parent. However, I gave up on reading this cover to cover, as I did with the first book for nine months, and eventually only used \"What to Expect\" as a reference guide.My attempt to read this chapter by chapter each month was met with several difficulties. Firstly, Heidi Murkoff must be crazy, or Super Mom to think that any Mother of a newborn or infant has the time to read this monstrosity; it simply cannot be held in one hand while the other hand cradles a nursing baby, the weight of the book will possibly break the hand in such an attempt. This coincides with my other difficulty with the book: there is just too much information for the average parent. This book covers so many topics, that much of the information was irrelevant to me, and only served to cause mild paranoia. Reading this book made me more paranoid than I had the right to be. I was worried about all of the rare and uncommon diseases, calculating my daughter's chance of SIDS, and being altogether too calculating about what to do the first year.The useful part of this book is the first page of each chapter, the only part that actually tells you what to expect each month of the first year. What the common developmental milestones are, accompanied by a mild reassurance that every child develops at their own rate, and what to anticipate at the pediatric check up each month.This book is better used as a reference. Instead of implanting worries into the mind of a new parent, the glossary at the end of this book can be a quick go to for questions like \"Is my baby sleeping too much?\", \"What is nipple confusion?\", \"Is what my Mother in Law said REALLY true?!\" and other ridiculous things every parent wonders and ends up calling the pediatrician's office about.I have found that signing up for the whattoexpect.com email subscription to be a good way to get much of the information found in this book in a chronologically relevant manner to my inbox.", "\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062d\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u0627 \u0648\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0639 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0639 \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629.. \u0646\u0635\u0627\u0626\u062d \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0632\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u0623\u0645 .. \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u062f\u062a \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0635\u064a\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u062c\u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0636 \u0648\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u0648\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0648\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0628\u0643\u0627\u0621\u0629.... \u0623\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0646\u064a \u0643\u062b\u064a\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0644\u0644\u0647 .. \u0648\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0623\u062a\u0645\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0623\u062a\u0645\u064a\u062a \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628:)", "This book is good, and it's definitely the most popular baby guide. But, there are other books that are better, like the one from the American Academy of Pediatricians, Caring for Your Baby and Young Child. I felt this book included too many topics that were just hype. It also covers topics in an inflammatory way, and then more calmly states the actual facts at the very end of a topic. For instance, it lists a number of foods not to give your child the first or even second year. I was starting to get worried. Then, as a disclaimer at the end, it says not to worry unless you have a family history of allergies to those specific foods. Another example is the list of things your child should do at each milestone. I felt like we kept up pretty well until the last milestone at one year when my child should have been doing everything except fly a rocket ship. Again, I felt panic that we were doing something wrong until I read a little further and figured out that nobody else's kids were doing it either. The next chapter said things like \"30% of children won't do this until they're 18 months old.\" Spend your money on some other book, if you have a chance.

I just really don't know what to say..", "This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called \"experts\" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don\u2019t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn\u2019t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already \"been there done that\" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn\u2019t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling\u2019s breezy, \u201cear friendly\u201d prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It\u2019s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

ROWLING FORESHADOWS EVERYTHINGGGG-when the Weasley men come to Privet Drive through the Dursleys' fireplace is just.... priceless. Yet ANOTHER scene that I wish had made it into the movie.-We get to meet Bill in this book (way earlier than in the movies, I might add), and Mrs. Weasley is very disapproving of how Bill looks. I love that Bill stood up for himself and was like NOBODY GIVE AN F HOW I LOOK, AND NEITHER DO IIIIII. It was a nice thing to throw in there.-Dobby is also in this book more, and seeing how different he is was really fun.-Harry and Ron fighting made my heart hurt so much.-All of the drama at the Yule Ball just made me SQUEEE because it's so obvious that Ron and Hermione like each other and they just don't want to admit it and GAH. THE FEELS.-I also love how much Hermione stands up for what she believes in, which you can particularly see in this book. She wants justice for the house-elves, she won't let Ron get away with being an idiot (like when he says he just wants a pretty girl to go to the ball with), and she is especially confident in this book as well. Malfoy and many other people are constantly teasing her, but she is completely above it, and for that I admire her.-WHEN HARRY IS LISTENING TO HAGRID AND MADAME MAXIME AND HE SEES THE BEETLE?

The fact that Ron has a huge crush on Krum while Hermione stays utterly unimpressed and as soon as Krum takes her to the ball the situation changes, Hermione likes Krum and Ron rips him (well, miniature him) apart7. Harry's fight with Ron. Not because I enjoy them fighting but because Jo perfectly captures the feeling of anger and frustration that I have everytime I'm in a similiar situation.8. The Wonky Feint. I'm still laughing.9. Rita Skeeter's reports. I love to hate her.10. Severus Snape cold bloodedly claiming he can't see a difference when Hermione's teeth are half a metre longer than usual. This incredible man.11. Molly Weasley being such a good mom to Harry. Got tears in my eyes just thinking about it.12.

GOBLET OF FIRE is definitely work and I could've done for a lot of cutting. One of the things I admire most about this series is the way J.K. Rowling can speed through a year in under 300 pages. And GOBLET is twice that length and it didn't always feel justified. I shouldn't complain because more time in this world is MORE TIME IN THIS WORLD, and it's all very realized, but the pacing still felt off. (I really, really could've done without the Quidditch World Cup.) When I first read this novel when I was 13 going on 14, I took a break for MONTHS. And the same thing happened during this reread as a 28-year-old. I think it was around the same part too. But once you get to the Third Task, it all picks up. This last fourth of the novel has always been my favorite. Voldemort's return! That scene with the Death Eaters! Harry vs. Voldemort! Moody isn't Moody! Rita Skeeter exposed! It's all wonderful.

Remember Cedric Diggory.\""], "The Buccaneers": ["\"First, the Romans had come. Then the Angles, Jutes, and Saxons. Then the Danes terrorized England for three centuries. Norman pirates took the country over in 1066. Five centuries later Turks raided the Thames and took prisoners to sell in the Libyan slave-market\u2026 But never had there been any phenomenon to match this\u2026 \u2013 this \u2018invasion of England by American women and their chiefs of commissariat, the silent American men\u2019\u2026\"This is by no means a high seas adventure story and you won\u2019t find any swashbuckling pirates within these pages. What you will find is a delightful and wholly absorbing story about a group of \u2018new rich\u2019 young ladies and their struggle to attain social status and suitable husbands in the complex society of 1870\u2019s New York. Annabel St. George, her sister Virginia, Lizzy and Mabel Elmsworth, and Conchita Closson will find that they just don\u2019t quite fit into the highest of social circles. Rather than vacationing at the fashionable Newport, they find themselves strolling the verandahs of the apparently less exclusive Saratoga \u2013 much to the dismay of their overly ambitious and scheming mothers. Thank goodness for the likes of Miss Laura Testvalley who has been hired as governess to Annabel, or Nan. Miss Testvalley is a godsend indeed \u2013 more than just a teacher of letters, manners and music, she will help Nan navigate the tricky and unmerciful currents of her society. Nan is not your ordinary social ladder-climbing young woman. She is romantic and clever and has hopes and dreams beyond that of a marriage made simply with the goal of achieving rank and wealth. I do believe Miss Testvalley sees her own reflection in the young eyes of Nan. Miss Testvalley\u2019s background and link to an impoverished family may not match that of Nan\u2019s upbringing, but in those things that matter most in life \u2013 those of the mind and of the heart \u2013 Miss Testvalley is a true champion. I simply adored her steadfast affection and support of Nan and her well-being. Now, when one doesn\u2019t quite succeed amongst the fierce competition of young ladies in New York society, there is one solution \u2013 England. At a time when many of the British aristocracy still upheld their titles and legacy but lacked the funds to sufficiently maintain their lands and other holdings, new money from overseas was perhaps just the ticket to preserving such heritage. And now behold \u2018the buccaneers\u2019 \u2013 our young ladies from New York. Can they \u2013 and their superficial mothers \u2013 achieve what they intensely desire in this country? There now exists a whole new set of rules and customs to which they must conform. Nan finds herself in love with the land and the sense of history which it invokes. Maybe finally this is a place in which she can find true happiness. \"It was not the atmosphere of London but of England which had gradually filled her veins and penetrated to her heart. She thought of the thinness of the mental and moral air in her own home: the noisy quarrels about nothing, the paltry preoccupations, her mother\u2019s feverish interest in the fashions and follies of a society which had always ignored her. At least life in England had a background, layers and layers of rich deep background, of history, poetry, old traditional observances, beautiful houses, beautiful landscapes, beautiful ancient buildings, palaces, churches, cathedrals. Would it not be possible, in some mysterious way, to create for oneself a life out of all this richness, a life which would somehow make up for the poverty of one\u2019s personal lot?\"But what is a girl to do when presented with the attentions of Guy Thwarte \u2013 landholder and heir to Honourslove, a place towards which Nan feels herself somehow immediately attached, or the Duke of Tintagel \u2013 owner of the romantic and historical castle of Tintagel, a place steeped in the legends of King Arthur. How this plays out, you will have to find out for yourself! You will most likely root for Nan with as much devotion as did I and Miss Testvalley. You will nod in agreement with Edith Wharton\u2019s subtle and witty scorn towards the customs and demands of both the New York upper crust as well as the British aristocracy. You will fall in love with the elegant prose which Wharton displays so flawlessly. One important note regarding this novel which did not in the least affect my desire to read it \u2013 Edith Wharton passed away prior to finishing writing this. My version included an ending completed by Marion Mainwaring, a Wharton scholar. I was not able to distinguish a difference in writing style between the words of Wharton versus Mainwaring, but then I am not by any means a Wharton scholar, but simply an amateur reader who thoroughly appreciated the effort put forth by Mainwaring. However, I can\u2019t help but wish that Wharton had survived to see this novel through to completion. One will never know exactly how she intended for this to end, but I was nevertheless quite satisfied.", "The Buccaneers is Edith Wharton\u2019s last and uncompleted novel. She had written approximately 89,000 words before her death and the novel was printed in its incomplete form by her publisher. In 1993 Marion Mainwaring, a noted Wharton scholar, completed the story, in line with notes that Wharton had left behind. She did a good job, since there is no obvious break in the voice between the beginning of the book and the end, but it seems clear to me that no one, even a great scholar, could ever know exactly how Wharton would have ended her work. If someone was going to guess, I think Mainwaring was a good choice, but I can\u2019t help wishing Wharton could have done it herself and that it were as pure a Wharton as The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth. Despite this, The Buccaneers is a masterful work of fiction, set in Wharton\u2019s high-society world, and full of the angst and manipulation that makes me happy for just a moment not to have been among the fabulously wealthy, well-married women of the time. Love and marriage do not go together like a horse and carriage in Wharton\u2019s world. Marriage is mostly an institution of convenience and profit, you get a name and I get money, and woe to the romantically inclined girl who stumbles into this world of harsh reality unawares.It is the reality behind the mask in a Wharton that makes it so worthwhile to read her. She strips the conventions to the bone and calls them by name. She exposes what people are willing to do and become in an effort to climb a social ladder, where someone else is always contriving to knock them off or at least kick them down a rung. And, she is superbly adept at lending light to the less affluent who have to circle in this world and navigate its waters. One of her finest characters in The Buccaneers is Miss Laura Testvalley, a governess who knows her place and sees the world without any rose-colored glasses, but whose caring heart cannot resist loving and aiding her charge, Annabel St. George (Nan). There is always the beauty of Wharton\u2019s descriptive writing that would, alone, make me wish to read this book: It was dark when Folyat House loomed high and stately in Portman Square, light shining from its long rows of windows and torches flaming at the grand portal. Footmen jumped down from the barouche which had met the travelers at Paddington, opened the escutcheoned doors, and helped them out. Other footmen led them up steps and into an oval colonnaded lobby. The Glenloe girls\u2019 eyes widened as the groom-of-the-chambers, attended by yet other footmen, conducted them into a great rectangular hall through an arch at the opposite end.\u201d When I read that,I feel I am one of the Glenloe girls and can see the glamour of the hall and the bustle of the footmen providing their services to the titled and privileged in a stoic and efficient manner.I loved seeing the five girls (who are the buccaneers) transform from innocent pawns in the game to active players. In the beginning, they are primarily spurred on by ambitious mothers, while they are, themselves, just happy to have a good time and attract the attention of the men. By the end, they are among the ones pulling the strings and conniving for power, and the wheat is separated from the chaff, as they say. They change, even toward one another. \u201cVirginia, who had seemed to Annabel so secure, so aloof, so disdainful of everything but her own pleasures, but who, as Lady Seadown, was enslaved to that dull half-sleeping Seadown, absorbed in questions of rank and precedence, and in awe--actually in awe--of her father-in-law\u2019s stupid arrogance\u2026\u201dFinally, they are seen, even by their husbands as pirates, conquerors, rulers who come to rule by stealth:\u201dWhat a gang of buccaneers you are!\u201d he breathed to his wife.\t\u201cBuccaneers,\u201d Lizzy reminded him gently, \u201cwere not notorious for paying fortunes for what they took.\u201dSeveral of these girls do pay heavily for what they take, and they pay more than money. Those who fail to toe society\u2019s line pay a price and lose a lot, but those who adhere to it pay almost as much, if not more. Wharton does not traffic in happily ever after in her novels--people die, they are ruined, they are impoverished. I personally see the hand of Mainwaring in this novel most heavily in the lightness of the penalties exacted. I believe Wharton would have visited a harsher punishment on her characters in the end. She was unflinching when portraying the viciousness of society. She had seen it in her lifetime. She knew the costs. You need only think of Lily Bart to know that she did. I can\u2019t help wondering, had fate allowed Wharton to finish this novel, if my dear Nan and Laura Testvalley would have been spared.", "I've fallen in love, readers!It took me about 12 hours from start to finish to read the last of Wharton's novels, left unfinished for decades and then completed in Wharton's style by scholar Marion Mainwaring. As I mentioned earlier, I've watched the PBS series three times now and there's something about it that gets to me. Perhaps because it's sexier and funnier and looser than what one would expect from the era, and because [SPOILER ALERT:] its ending which actually arises from Wharton's notes, is decidedly un-Whartonian. I'm terribly moved by the idea that at the end of her life, Edith Wharton would decide to write a novel about a heroine who behaves in the exact opposite way of nearly all her other major characters, who--to put it quite frankly--doesn't give a shit about social convention and flouts it utterly. I like to think of it as the author's reconciliation to romance, her final, deathbed middle finger to the rules and hierarchies with which she had such a deeply-tortured relationships.Reading The Buccaneers is a dream for those who like comedies-of-manners for their own sake. Wharton will never be Austen: she takes ten lines to explain the social relationships that Austen dispatches with a sentence (this, I think, is evidence of Wharton's psychic struggle with society). But the first two thirds of the book, written by Wharton without revision, each page dropped off the side of her bed as she finished it, are blithe, satirical, sexy and both funny and sad.The many scenes where the characters forge connections over poetry and art as well Nan St. George's stifling marriage and post-marital sexual awakening make me feel as though this is Wharton's Persuasion. And like that novel and other novels with heavy autobiographical elements--Copperfield, The Song of the Lark, etc. it has an emotional immediacy that feels startling and gives it a value different from a more controlled, classically perfect novel.Wharton's contrast of Laura Testevalley, who gives up on romance and sacrifices her chance of happiness so that Nan can run away with Guy Thwarte, and Nan, who finds happiness with Guy after having giving up on it in her role as duchess, fascinates: one feels that Wharton is both Laura, in middle age loosening her scruple, and Nan herself.Mainwaring's best contributions are a number of concluding love scenes that are satisfying (if not as satisfying as the wheat-field fornication in the film ;)) and a deft weaving-in of the horribly sexist divorce laws of the time that existed to punish women, humiliate them, and treat them as property. Marital rape is legal, and Nan's refusal to \"produce heirs\" for her huband after becoming emotionally estranged from him is a pivotal plot point.This was definitely the best read I've embarked on in a while. I couldn't recommend it enough for Wharton fans who have long desired a less \"thwarted\" ending for her characters. I'd add that picturing Greg Wise in the romantic leading role definitely added a lot to the reading experience.http://unpretentiouslitcrit.blogspot....", "I found a copy of this book in a used bookstore, and hesitated before finally caving and buying it. I loved The Age of Innocence, but (as I learned from reading the book jacket while in the store) The Buccaneers is unfinished. Wharton wrote about 89,000 words of the story before dying in 1937, and Wharton scholar Marion Mainwaring picked up where the book left off and finished the novel. There's a note at the end about how Mainwaring made some changes to Wharton's draft to account for later changes in the story (and she also removed some hella racist language), but for the most part, the first two thirds of the book are primarily Wharton's. I don't like the idea of reading unfinished stories, and I can't decide what irks me more: an unfinished novel like Suite Francaise, which didn't have an ending because Irene Nemirovsky died before she could finish it; or The Buccaneers, where another author is brought in to complete the draft. Either way, it makes for a frustrating experience. That being said, Mainwaring does a pretty good job of continuing Wharton's novel, to the point where I couldn't tell where Wharton's writing ended and Mainwaring's began. Maybe if I was a more experienced Wharton reader I would have noticed discrepancies, but as far as I was concerned, it was a solid story. The story opens in 1876 New York, where \"new money\" sisters Virginia and Annebel St. George are preparing to find husbands. They find that they can't compete with the old money families of New York, and, after one of their friends marries an English lord who was visiting America, decide to follow her to England. Guided by their British governess, Laura Testvalley, the girls make their mark on the London social scene. Two more American sisters join the St. George girls, and their group becomes known as \"the buccaneers,\" fortune-hunting Americans invading London to snatch up all the eligible lords and dukes. Each of the four American girls ends up marrying into the aristocracy, with varied success. The story wasn't as tightly constructed or engrossing as The Age of Innocence, but I still loved reading Wharton's perspective on the shallowness and complexity of high society in the 1800's. She also makes it clear, without needing to slam it in your face, how much it sucked to be a woman in this world. The two most engrossing characters were Miss Testvalley, a confirmed spinster who's given up all hope of finding a husband and throws herself into the job of finding good marriages for her charges; and Annabel St. George, who ends up making the best marriage and is completely miserable. Her efforts to make the best of her circumstances, knowing that she's completely trapped in this life that she chose, were heartbreaking and beautiful. \"To begin with, what had caused Annabel St. George to turn into Annabel Tintagel? That was the central problem! Yet how could she solve it, when she could no longer question that elusive Annabel St. George, who was still so near to her, yet as remote and unapproachable as a plaintive ghost?Yes - a ghost. That was it. Annabel St. George was dead, and would therefore never be able to find out why and how that mysterious change had come about. ...'The greatest mistake,' she mused, her chin resting on her clasped hands, her eyes fixed unseeingly on the dim reaches of the park, 'the greatest mistake is to think that we ever know why we do things. ...I suppose the nearest we can ever come to it is by getting what old people call \"experience.\" But by the time we've got that were no longer the person who did the things we no longer understand. The trouble is, I suppose, that we change every moment; and the things we did stay.\"", "The St. George and Elmsworth families are *new money* and looking for brighter prospects for their daughters in the marriage market so they hie off to England looking for Dukes and Earl with aging homes in need repairs that only cold hard cash can bring them. The young ladies make their splash, make their marriages and then no surprise, have to lie in those beds that they've made for themselves. Some are successful, others not so - despite a very promising beginning. \"But it's rather lonely sometimes, when the only things that seem real are one's dreams.\"I really did enjoy this a lot, and Wharton excels as always at her descriptions of society's quirks and restrictions. This was Wharton's last novel, which was finished off by Marion Mainwaring based on plot outlines left by Wharton. I definitely noticed a difference towards the end where MM stepped in to finish, and like other reviews some of the first 2/3 don't have quite the polished feel of Wharton's earlier work. Still, fans of Wharton and this topic (American heiresses in London) should definitely give this one a go. Just don't expect The Age of Innocence or The House of Mirth.", "The Buccaneers proved to be an interesting bookend for the career of Edith Wharton.Wharton had completed about two-thirds of The Buccaneers when she died in 1937. For decades, it appeared in \u201cunfinished\u201d form. But in the early \u201890s, Wharton expert Marion Mainwaring completed the book, based on Wharton\u2019s own high level synopsis.The Buccaneers proved to be an apt companion piece to Wharton\u2019s most famous novel, The Age of Innocence. Set in the same time period, it focused on a group of \u201cnew money\u201d girls who found themselves denied entry to the upper reaches of New York society. Instead, they crossed the Atlantic, where London found their brash charms a breath of fresh air. Marriage to a variety of nobles ensued.Wharton\u2019s idea was fairly genius. Dramatizing how a group kept out of \u201cold\u201d society in one country prospered by being the new blood that an even older social set in another cried out for provided an interesting extrapolation of themes the writer had explored in numerous of her works. The Buccaneers still was a drama of manners. The Americans faced differing levels of success in navigating the labyrinth of customs and expectations of Upper Class Brits. But unlike other novels where the newcomers were kept out, here they succeeded brilliantly. Fans of Downton Abbey may recognize the concept of a rich American becoming the wife of a British noble.At its core, The Buccaneers was about the complicated romance of Nan St. George and Guy Thwarte. A brief encounter established a seed of sympathy between the duo. But Guy was obliged to go abroad and make the money needed to keep his family\u2019s estate afloat. Nan entered an ill-advised marriage to a colorless Duke who couldn\u2019t appreciate her unique sensibilities. The feelings that spark between Nan and Guy when they re-enter one another\u2019s lives drive the drama of the final act.In many ways, The Buccaneers is atypical of Wharton\u2019s plots. For one, the star-crossed couple got that rarest of Wharton rewards: a happy ending. The duo transcended the blight on their reputations and ran off together. Prior Wharton heroines had only a life or regret and loss (or, occasionally, poverty-stricken death) as reward for their impulsive actions and questionable decisions. Nan got to be with the man she loved, even if the scandal produced would blow back on her family.Nan also had something few Wharton heroines had: a sympathetic friend and advisor who cared more about Nan\u2019s happiness than bowing to propriety. Nan\u2019s governess, Laura Tetsvalley (daughter of an expat Italian family), filled the maternal role for Nan more capably than Nan\u2019s own fairly useless mother. Laura made mistakes of her own along the way, but eventually elected to bear the brunt of Nan\u2019s scandal on her own shoulders, allowing her former pupil to escape a life that made her unhappy.The Buccaneers also is notable for how sympathetic its putative villains are. Ushant, the colorless Duke, set a lot of the unhappiness in motion. He married Nan not because he particularly valued her, but because he found her ignorance of his station appealing and thought he could mold her into an ideal wife. While that doesn\u2019t value Nan\u2019s virtues, it\u2019s also not exactly hissable. The Duke was a product of his upbringing and only wanted his wife to learn her role and help perpetuate his line. But the story made clear that, while not warm, he wasn\u2019t a bad person. The rules of British society at the time gave him the right to force his will on Nan, but he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to do that. Given that his wife left him after telling him she was in love with someone else, the fact that he tried to end the union in as quiet a manner as possible is rather commendable.The Dowager Duchess was also a source of antagonism for Nan. But the writing does a good job of demonstrating that she was motivated by her sense of duty, to her son, his position and their family. You may not like her, but she\u2019s understandable. Even a spoiled noblewoman who launched an unfounded scandal about Nan out of a fit of pique was more pathetic than evil.Some of those differences might be attributed to Mainwaring. And yet she channels Wharton\u2019s style almost seamlessly. And the plot developments were based on Wharton\u2019s own plans for The Buccaneers. Mainwaring blends into Wharton\u2019s work quite well. A reader could believe the finished book is the product of one voice.For fans of Wharton\u2019s more famous books, The Buccaneers is a thematic variation worth checking out.A version of this review originally appeared on www.thunderalleybcp.com", "** spoiler alert **\n           Books like this are so very difficult to review. I felt so deeply for Nan and I could understand how she felt and what she thought. Indeed, I could relate to her very well as her thinking process is similiar to mine. My problem with the book is that in the end she makes a choice. When you read it it seems like a good choice. You want her to live and love. You want her to live happily ever after, to be with the man that she is passionately in love with. And in most stories that would be wonderful. But in this story there is a slight problem.She's already married.The writing style is engaging, the plot is well-developed and fascinating (I finished it in two days.), and you love some characters and hate others. But somehow at the end of the book, despite being relieved that she will live happily ever after, you feel a slight tinge of guilt associated with that relief. I hate reading books like this because I'm a romantic at heart and deep down inside I know that if I finished the book and she didn't end up with the man that she loved I would be furious. I love books where the girl and the guy come together in the end. When they're in love and live happily ever after. That's why books like this are so difficult for me...because sometimes what's right isn't what's \"romantic\". And I want love to prevail in the end.Nan did what was right \"romantically\" but did she do the right thing \"morally\"?Questions like that are bound to surface after finishing Edith Wharton's \"The Buccaneers.\"", "The Buccaneers is a romantic anti-romance novel, if that makes any sense. Five young American daughters of fortunate financial speculators, finding themselves excluded from the crustiest New York society, begin to marry into an extended family of English nobility. As attractive as marrying into the top tier of society initially seems, navigating their responsibilities to ancestral mansions, families and tenants brings unhappiness, particularly for the youngest, Nan, who has married a duke who wanted a bride he could mold. Nan realizes that she\u2019s made a mistake in marrying the duke, but there is no way for her to return to her schooldays, and pursing her true love will be disastrous.This story could be completely depressing (typical for Edith Wharton) if it weren\u2019t for the fun of comparing it to the real-life drama of the Churchill family\u2019s American heiress brides. I listened to The Churchills: In Love and War back in February and March, and it\u2019s clear that Wharton borrowed liberally from the sensational memoirs released by Consuelo Vanderbilt (married to the Duke of Marlborough) and Jenny Jerome Churchill (mother of Sir Winston Churchill). The result is that the book feels a little smutty, the way that reading a tabloid might.If you don\u2019t know anything about the disappointing fairy-tale marriages Wharton is referencing, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this as a particularly fun or interesting read. Not that it was bad, exactly. It was just uneven. The depictions of the mothers in New York are from a comedy-of-manners, and the ruminations of Sad Nan come from a melodrama. Nan\u2019s sister and friends basically disappear from the book halfway through, when it appeared from the beginning that they would have slightly larger roles. Wharton died before completing a first draft, so it\u2019s possible that there would have been substantial editing. As it is, Marian Mainwaring made it a mostly cohesive story focused on Nan\u2019s reclaiming her own identity.", "The synopsis for this 1938 edition for The Buccaneers (appearing above) is completely wrong! Who wrote that?! No swashbuckling pirates, here! Edith Wharton's \"novel\" was published as a lightly edited, incomplete manuscript in the year following her death. It was sure to have been her masterpiece!The \"Buccaneers\" are 5 nouveau riche American girls who, steered by an English-Italian (cousin to artist/poet D.G. Rosetti) governess, \"invade\" the Bristish peerage in the 'seventies (1870's).While later editions append with an ending written by a Wharton scholar, I am charmed that my local libray is still circulating this original 1938 edition! There is no ending; it's a cliffhanger prematurely left off amidst a failing marriage and budding romance. So why 5 stars??The writing is superb. The British landscape is beautifully elaborated, in watercolor tones. The subject is fascinating: courtships spanning the improbable social/cultural divide between American upstarts and British aristocrats. And then there's the novelty of reading an unfinished work. The editor insists that Ms. Wharton was not finished developing several of her characters. The contrast between her well-developed characters and the more-transparent ones helps a modern reader appreciate qualities of \"classic\" literature. I universally recommend this forgotten masterpiece. I'm still deciding if I'll read the \"finished\" edition, as this one was surprisingly satisfying even in it's incompletion.", "See discussion in the Reading for Pleasure group/Buddy Reads/July 2016"], "Changelings": ["Great buddy read with Joanne.A fun, light and entertaining read with a great concept, a good plot and unique characters. Take one sentient planet, two wonderful children who can morph into seals, a sacred turtle with a very big and strong but gentle guardian and throw in a pair of furry wild cats to serve as nannies and protectors along with a lot of very chatty playful seals and you got yourself a real treat. The interactions between the animals and humans were absolutely charming. I loved those the most. If you are ever in a need of a smile on a cloudy day, i suggest you pick this book up and give it a try. If a Shonghili's comment won't bring a smile to your lips when he says: \"I flash my furry butt at you, big fella, and flap my hind flippers in your general direction. I don't want to see anything hotter than a teakettle for the rest of my life\", I'm sure seeing a wild snow leopard trying to remove a dirty diaper without scratching the kit's pelt will do the trick.", "Changelings is the result of a collaboration: Anne McCaffrey (of The Dragonriders of Pern fame) and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough (The Healer's War). Although both are fine writers, I found this book less than the talents of either, rather than even just the sum of their abilities. The story takes place on a sentient planet, Petaybee, as seen through the eyes of the Shongilis, one of the many immigrant families that combine Inuit and Irish heritage. The children of Sean and Yana Shongili are twins, Ronan Born for Water, and Murel Monster Slayer. Their father, Sean, is a selkie-to-human changeling, a trait passed on to the twins.Petaybee is itself creating a landmass for the people and animals with which it feels a sense of harmony. Volcanic activity--terraforming--is the process of raising land out of the ocean, much as Michener's Hawaii described for that island. The idea of a planetary consciousness appeals to me in these times, especially that it might get to veto things that would harm it.Yet I found too many sections of the plot predictable, somewhat like a stage play in which the theater-goer sadly finds that each of the props, if there, are certain to figure in the drama. Things are seldom there just for ambiance, mood or the deliciousness of illuminating the setting or a character's choices. And, despite the precocity of the twins, some things are just too pat, too cute.Moreover, to me the writing often seemed unedited. For example, in the Prologue, the word and phrase repetition almost made me quit. Here's the first paragraph: \"Petaybe was changing. It was always changing. The quakes and eruptions, avalanches and slides, great winds on land and sea, even the ebb and flow of the tide, brought about fundamental changes in the planet's surface, in the way it was. The people who lived on Petaybe knew and accepted this. If it had not been for the changes, jump-started and accelerated by a terraforming process begun only a few decades before, no one would have been able to live on Petayabee. The people made songs about the changes, celebrated them.\"Maybe I'm picky. Maybe it's because I'd just come off reading the amazing book Savvy by Ingrid Law, also a fantasy-adventure. Maybe I was having a tough week. But maybe not. I think there is less here than meets the eye. Another story based on a hoary formula.", "A wonderful buddy read with Laura! This book is great for both young adults and adults. I loved it for its light reading qualities. Nothing extremely scary. Those parts that were scary did not last long. I love animals and always imagine what they would say if they could talk. The authors do a great job of translating animal speak to make it very believable. I like the idea of a sentient planet. There were parts with real suspense as well as parts with incomparable beauty. The descriptions of the planet and its people are lovely. The authors did some cultural research for Hawaiian and other cultures for this book and their hard work shows.", "It's always good to visit a place you enjoyed for the second time. You anticipate more of the same and hope you won't be disappointed.After reading the Petaybee series, I was thrilled to learn that there was also a Twins Of Petaybee series, and having read the first installment, I was not disappointed. The sentient planet now has two more unique residents, Ronan and Murel Shongili, the selkie twins. They and their father Sean can transform into seals when in water, and they use their gifts to explore freely.I enjoyed watching three years of the twins' lives (from age 7-10) and how they had to pick up the fight their parents began to protect Petaybee from the Company who only wants to exploit it. It was also good to see familiar characters like Colonel Yanaba Maddock-Shongili, Sean Shongile, Clodagh and of course Nanook the track cat and Coaxtl the clouded snow leopard.Those two are the only reason why I can't give five stars. Those blasted cats kept changing genders every ten pages! In the previous series, Nanook was established as a black MALE track cat. Coaxtl was a FEMALE snow leopard, and even thought once on how she could tell that Nanook desired her for a mate. When we were reunited with them as babysitters for the infant selkie twins, both of them were male. Then Coaxtl went back to her correct gender and Nanook followed her! By the time the book ended, I didn't know what they were :-). Ah, the perils of writing a series. I also didn't like that Diego Metaxos barely got mentioned, and Bunny Rourke slipped through so fast I almost missed her. I saw a fleeting reference to Bunny's baby- I can only assume that she and Diego got married and this is their offspring because it was never mentioned. When you create a series that captures the imagination, you have to keep up with the folks you teach your readers to love.That notwithstanding, I'm off to read the other two in the trilogy :-)", "Anne McCaffrey is another author I struggle to put down once started, so this has been a reading Sunday to round off my holiday.This is a new Petaybee book about the Selkie twin children of Yana Maddock and selkie Sean Shongli and how they link with otters and other parts of the sentient planet.

This is really helping me get a handle on Rails. Good stuff.", "In general, this book does a fairly good job of helping you create a rails-based application. Part 3 includes some great in-depth information on the topics that are briefly discussed in Part 2. I only have one real gripe about this book. It packs in lots of topics (e.g. db theory, AJAX, unit testing, security, deployment), but it doesn't really tell you much about them. Therefore, if you have a problem, then good luck figuring it out using the content in the book. A good example is the final chapter which covers deployment. The chapter devotes only a few small paragraphs to configuring Apache for passenger. To me, this section was completely useless unless you were already an expert with Apache configuration. I ended that chapter with a broken Apache server and no resources (from the book) to begin fixing it.Another problem that I had with that chapter is that it really didn't follow the pattern that the chapters in Part 2 used. In those chapters, the authors would should you how to do something relatively small, show you how to test it, and then provide some troubleshooting information if the task was particularly complex. The deployment chapter gave you a *very brief and generalized* tutorial in each section, and then just assumed that everything went perfectly. It didn't show you how to test anything, and it didn't help you troubleshoot any possible problems.Don't get me wrong. I know that no book will provide all of the information that I would ever need about a subject, and thank goodness for the internet in these situations. I was just hoping that all of the chapters in a book that I actually bought would provide better information than some person's blog.

The book includes information on how to do automated testing, like functional and unit testing. However, it expects to enter all commands to the rails console and does not always provide \"results\" in the book. The second part described implementation details and why Rails works. That part was harded to read rapidly as it contained API descriptions, etc. I rated this book as 3/5, since for me it would be more appropriate to learn just what API is available. The rest of that I will not memorize anyway, so I will go to the documentation instead, when needed. At the same time, this book gave me a pretty good overview on rails.

When I realized the GR group \"Catching up on the Classics\" was doing it as a group read, I jumped in, excited for the chance to revisit Heidi and her simple, joyous life in the Swiss alps with her grandfather.Heidi, a 5 year old orphan, has been raised by her mother's sister Dete, who resents the imposition. When Dete gets a good job offer, she marches Heidi up to the Swiss village where she was raised, the (fictional) village of D\u00f6rfli (\"little village\") and then even further up the mountain, to dump little Heidi on her unsuspecting grandfather, an embittered recluse. Despite being taken aback, the grandfather quickly takes to Heidi, admiring her intelligence and enthusiasm. She thrives in the lovely Swiss alps and country life, immediately shedding her more citified clothing and ways, and helping the local goatherd Peter. The Falknis mountain, with its two \"towers,\" near where Heidi and Peter tend the goatsEveryone around Heidi grows to love her: her grandfather, Peter, Peter's grandmother. The only problem is that \"Alm-Uncle,\" her grandfather, has such a deep distrust of people and town life that he refuses to even send her to the village school. Heidi is growing up happy and uncivilized when her aunt Dete suddenly reappears after three years, determined to take Heidi to Frankfurt to be the companion of Clara, a rich but sickly and invalid girl. Our bouncy, enthusiastic girl starts to feel desperately unhappy, cooped up in the big city. But Heidi has lessons to learn, and God has a plan.I loved the detailed descriptions of the lovely Alps and life there in olden times. I suppose Heidi is a bit of a Mary Sue character, but her exuberant nature, jumping around all the time like a young goat, was charming. And -- continuing the animal metaphors -- I really felt for her when she felt like a trapped bird in Frankfurt, though the wasting away thing was a bit over the top. The Alm-Uncle's character, bitter toward mankind generally but loving toward his bright granddaughter, seemed entirely believable to me, and honestly I got a bit teary as he began, like the prodigal son in Christ's parable, to find his way back to harmony with God and with his fellow men. Clara's devout grandmamma is a paragon of saintliness but has a little humor to leaven her spiritual lessons to Heidi; Peter's ailing, blind grandmother is equally devout but would fit in well with other Victorian-era sickly but wise characters.The preachiness got a little too heavy-handed toward the end, although I did appreciate the message of continuing to trust God even when your prayers aren't answered immediately, and at the same time needing to take action to improve your own circumstances, as much as you can. I also can't help but be charmed with the notion that country living, with lots of fresh goat milk and toasted goat cheese on bread, brisk mountain air and the beauty of nature, heals pretty much everything.Mmmmm! ... okay, actually I don't like goat cheese, toasted or otherwise, but I have to say Heidi tempts me to give it another shot.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with Heidi and her friends again, after many years apart. I recommend Heidi to readers who like old-fashioned children's classics, like Anne of Green Gables, and don't mind a healthy dose of religious content in their reading.A note on English translations: Since this book is over 100 years old, it's out of copyright and there are several free English versions available. I read parts of Heidi in German and did some comparisons between the three English versions I found on Project Gutenberg. None of them completely satisfied me, but I thought this one was the best, closest to the original German text without being unbearably awkward: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1448. I'm sure there are better translations out there, but I was working with what I could find free online.", "Heidi's Ten Life Enriching Lessons for Grownups:I normally read children's books during Christmastime. Not only to catch up with my Reading Challenge (I am behind by 10 books as of this writing), but also, most of children's books have life lessons that can be good reminders for the coming year. New Year always means new beginning, new hope. Do you remember when you were still in school and after reading a story in class, the teacher asked you what was the lessons you learned from it? So, in this year's series of children's books, I will try to list the ten lessons I was reminded while reading a certain book.1) Prayer is powerful. Sometimes we feel helpless and all we have left is to pray. Sometimes God does not give what we ask for because it may not be good for us yet or there is something else, a better one, that He will give us.2) Nature was once a sight to behold. Never been to Swiss Alps, the setting of this novel but one of my favorite movies is \"The Sound of Music\" and that opening scene where Maria is singing on top of the mountain is gloriously beautiful. With the global warming and the continuous degradation of forests worldwide, I wonder how that mountain looks like now.3) Your conscience can haunt you. The goat shepherd boy, Peter, did something unforgivable and \"the little man\" inside him haunts him that he could not eat, sleep and he becomes suspicious of all men who go up to the mountain as he thinks his uncle will give him in to the police. Until he decides to tell the truth. In this world of chaos, full of deceits and treachery, it is nice to be reminded that no alibis or justifications can cover up misdeeds and injustices. We should all come clean and the sooner the better.4) Nothing compares to doing good deeds. These all sound like motherhood statements and pies in the sky. Cliches. However, Heidi has nothing in her heart but to love her grandfather, grandmother, Peter, Clara and all the characters in the book. In the end, she becomes happy. If only life is as simple as this. However, we all know that we reap what we sow, so why resist? It is better to be in the bright, happy side.5) Fresh air, fresh food, clean water, happiness galore. Most sickness are psychological. Most diseases are caused by the environment. Pollution. Too much stress. Processed food. Fast food. Clara, the invalid, gets well when she stays with her positive friend Heidi atop the mountain. This part reminded me of the boy in The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett. But this book, Heidi was first published in 1880 and The Secret Garden in 1910 so this must be the original.6) Children can be wiser than grownups. This is a much-used plot in children's books but still holds true. We grownups, we parents, have many things to learn from our children. If you are a parent, you know this. No debates.7) Goats can be endearing. My mother and father love dogs, cats, fowls, birds, monkeys, etc. So, when I was growing up in the province, our backyard was like a zoo. However, I did not know that goats can be nice to take care too. Goat meat is one of the favorites of some men here in Manila to go with their booze.8) Don't resist change. Rather, embrace it. Heidi did not go back to the mountain to resist studying. Rather, she brings her writing materials and books to the mountain and study there with her friend Clara. She even teaches Peter to read.9) Words can be powerful especially if the one who is sending it has the credibility. Heidi has not done a nasty thing in her life so when she speaks even the stubborn Peter pays attention. The grandmother's frail body and gloomy world suddenly bright up when Heidi is around.10) Grumpy old men need young girls. No, I don't mean the dirty way. The grumpy hermit-like grandfather living alone on top of the mountain because he hates the world is convinced by Heidi to go back to the town. She has that very positive influence to everyone around her including his now-cynic grandfather. Very positive novel. Said to be the one of the most-read most-loved ever book in Switzerland. This has been translated to 60 languages and read by all people around the world.You are not well-read if you have not read this. (This sound like coming from my grumpy side, don't you think?)", "Mostly during primary school my chosen prospective career was saint.Ah, but then there was the period where I discovered Heidi and as I read and reread it a bunch of times, I most fervently wanted to become a goatherd, with all that this entailed. The bell. The sleeping snuggled into warm hay in the attic. The eating of too much cheese.So taken was I with the idea of Switzerland that when we were asked, about grade 6, where we were going for the term holiday, I \u2013 who had never been on a holiday because we were way too poor \u2013 said Switzerland. I just might have gotten away with this but for the fact that my mother taught in the senior school. Since I had further elaborated when pressed, that we were going by boat \u2013 another fixation I had throughout childhood, seafaring \u2013 and the term holiday was a mere fortnight, news soon spread through the school that my mother was leaving her teaching job. In case you don\u2019t get the plot so far, I was weaving this fantasy in Australia where I was born and raised.Never mind the trouble I got into for this, it didn\u2019t in the least affect my taste for anything Swittish.Since then, as an adult I\u2019ve been able to visit Switzerland five times, mostly Geneva. By no means goatherd territory, but still. You can see Geneva as a straightforwardly beautiful city. You can see it through Australian eyes as having that aesthetic qualities of age that our cities so lack, not to mention the mountain backdrop the like of which we would never see at home. Or you can see it, I discover, as a young child would whose dreams were always of other places. I confess as I\u2019ve wandered about the city, staring at those snow-capped mountains, to feeling that I have come home in some way that I\u2019m sure derives from the profound effect this utterly magical book had on me when I read it so long ago. I don\u2019t know if other people wonder if they have let down the small bundles of hopes and dreams they once were, but I do. It breaks my heart, the idea that I might have disappointed that little hopeful dreaming thing I was once, and I have found it a very emotional experience being in this dream I once went to sleep with every night. I really can\u2019t remember, but I hope she \u2013 I \u2013 did always believe dreams come true. Yeah, well. Sometimes they do.", "Thanks to all the bowdlerized, Disneyfied stupidifications it's been through, poor old Heidi's story gets a bum rap. In fact, Heidi is no sap, and more to the point, her friend Clara with the wheelchair is no timid Victorian dying violet. Somebody plonked this great big book in my lap when I was seven years old, a good reader, and in need of something heavy to hold me down on a long car trip. It worked; it took me off from my flat prairie summer to a land of purple mountain peaks and jumping goats and snow that piled up above the windows in the winter.Heidi comes to live with her grandfather when she is five years old, up high on the mountain where he shuns and is shunned by the village below. For the next three years, she sees almost no one else but the goatherd, Peter, and his mother, grandmother, and the goats. She is never lonely; she is like a nature spirit, communing with the wind, sun, trees, eagles and flowers. It is only when her aunt comes to take her away to Frankfort, to be a companion to ill, housebound Clara, that homesickness and loneliness set in. Heidi's rescue concludes the first half of the book, the half most people know; how Heidi heals the people in her life is the second and more interesting half. I have returned to this book so often that my 1921 edition is all worn out and crumbly, with the plates falling out. Spyri creates a world I would like to live in. I don't know if it ever existed. There are elements of melodrama in the story that are sometimes too sweet for the modern palate, but the scenery is vivid and honest and the pathos is, for the most part, truly felt.", "Heidi is a basic white girl with a fondness for mountain air and goats.", "I cried a lot out of happiness reading this book....................The tears flowed out of my eyes without me noticing them...........The story begins well and is lively and after certain chapters (after the first half, to be precise), the novel contains only pure and innocent happiness. Each chapter in the second half gets better and the happiness begins and flows through the chapters making the reader very sentimental and longing for such lovely landscapes, friendships, relationships, and happiness.I do not want to say anything about the plot. I just only want to make some observations.This is a lovely book for the kids and as well as for the adults.For Kids:It will teach them first and foremost that Love is the foundation for happiness of man.It will teach them to establish lovely relationships. It will teach them to love all.It will teach them to love the landscapes, the environments and the animals.It will teach them to pray.It will give them much to cheer about.For Adults:It will speak to them of forgiveness.It will speak to them of the vanity of riches, or rather it will teach them the right usage of riches.It will teach them to appreciate the richness of relationships and the expansive nature.It will take them to their innocent childhood memories.It will give them much to cheer about.Final Note:It is a fact that nothing much is known about the author of HEIDI, Johanna Spyri. In her lifetime when she was asked to write her autobiography, she replied thus: \"The external path of my life is very simple, and there is nothing special to be mentioned. My inner life was full of storms, but who can describe it?\"And even if a star is very far and its details are hard to get by, still its shining splendor is more than enough for our limited vision. J. Spyri will always be remembered as the author of HEIDI and that is the greatest recognition. Thank you Johanna Spyri for giving us HEIDI.", "FREE good-quality audio recording of Heidi, narrated by Kara Shallenberg: http://librivox.org/heidi-by-johanna-...Heidi is a childhood favorite. All the evils of the world might be cured by mountain air, kindness, and goat's milk. Vividly descriptive. Just whisk me to the Swiss Alps, bright with myriad blossoms, fragrant with fir and pine, alive with birdsong. The blessings of nature surround, the sun shines down all around, and never an unkind sound. Heidi is five \u2014 pale and small \u2014 when she first moves to Grandfather's simple alpine home, where the heavens twinkle right into her sleeping loft. Soon she's running barefoot, limber as the goats, burnished in the sun, glowing with health. Happy.Then the dark days, abducted by nasty Aunt Dete, hustled away to dreary Frankfurt and Fraulien Rotten-weiller. Heidi, wasting away, miserably homesick, day after day.Young Klara, wheelchair-bound and brave. Klara's kind grandmama. A foolish houseman, afraid of ghosts. The wise doctor.The reunion. Even now, I choke up when Grandfather and Heidi are reunited. If he can cry on the sly, then so can I. Tenderhearted but gruff is Grandfather, an outcast with a shameful past. The Prodigal Son, neatly simplified and personified for children.Young Peter, a boy on the verge. His kind, blind grandmother. Bread and hymns.A timeless classic for children, a non-romantic romance, for on Grandfather's mountain, everything ends well. Somewhat sappy, slightly preachy, probably idealized, yet I fall for it every time. Spyri surprised a few chuckles out of me, too.

Here is the list: http://librivox.org/reader/19?primary...", "About halfway around the book, I remembered reading it, in Turkish, years ago. Turkish translation of it was a bit different, if my memory serves me. For once, while there were mentions of God and how good He is etc, religious preaching was not as prominent.I stumbled upon similar deviations at White Fang, which is one of my favourite books. Reading it in English was like hearing a memory from someone else's perspective. Familiar at core ,but WTF is he talking about at the same time. In Turkish version, the spotlight belonged to the wolf cub and his struggles. In English version, the author's shadow was all over it, fighting his own inner battle about God and his place in life. I love both versions but I don't believe they are the same book. Language and the culture behind it, have a lot of to do with the differences, but in my opinion, most of the time, translators become the second author. The end result is rarely the same book, even if it is telling the same story. Especially with books who has a lot of ideas hiding behind the tale.So, this was a familiar but new book for me. It started as I hoped, giving me the warm feelings, being with a person who is inherently kind, gives you. All those cute moments with goats and playing... Despite of the stilting, formal language, everything was joyful.Then it started preaching heavily. I am a religious person. Even though I'm not Christian, some of the main teachings are similar and I agreed with most concepts, the book was trying to teach. But these were not artfully infused into the story. I was beaten on the head with kindness and repetition. And everything in the story was to point us what we should do. After a while, I just couldn't find the same warmth in it. *and tbh, Heidi became so annoying with her perfect angelic-ness. my nephew is a demanding little shit, but I'd take him over Heidi anyday because let's face it; Heidi is bloody boring with her wheeee attitude towards every-fucking-thing. there is a line between being a bubbly-happy person who brings joy to others and being a bubbly-happy person who annoys the life out of others I think I'll go watch the anime of Heidi, to see if it is as good as I remember. I need to shake this disappointment off of me.", "My two favorite aunts gave me Heidi when I was eight years old. I don't know if it was Christmas or birthday; all I know is I have them to thank not only for this but for Anne of Green Gables (and my very favorite stuffed bear Snowball), bless their names forever. As with Anne, I read Heidi over and over (and over), and followed up with some of the sequels from the library, and loved it dearly; unlike with Anne, though, I haven't read Heidi in many years. The Goodreads Kindred Spirits group chose it as their \"Akin to Anne\" group read for last June, and I fully intended to join in then, but in the end it took being faced on December 30 with a Challenge shortcoming of two books for me to pick up what surely had to be a quick read so as to meet my goal. (It worked.) I was a little worried. Childhood memories are fragile. It doesn't take much to stain a current opinion, leaching backward to taint what was so beloved. But, I'm happy to say, Heidi came through it just about unscathed. Peter didn't, but I'll come to that. The story: Heidi is an orphan at six, and lives with her aunt until said aunt gets a job and decides that the girl's grandfather is just going to have to serve his time looking after the child, no matter how alarming his reputation is. Just about everyone Aunt Dete meets exclaims in horror at the idea of leaving the poor child with the old man, the Alm-Uncle; he hates everyone, and makes no secret of it. She's doomed. Dete is not an admirable character, but I will say for her that she is tough: she ploughs on despite the exclamations of horror and barely even gives the Alm-Uncle a chance to say no before she vanishes, leaving grandfather and granddaughter together. And it's fine. It's better than fine. Heidi flourishes, with her grandfather providing quiet but loving support and the goats and Peter providing entertainment, and her own active nature keeping her constantly occupied. And Grandfather flourishes a bit himself, softening and expanding a bit. And when that aunt of hers pops up again a couple of years later and sweeps Heidi away with her again to dump her on a wealthy household that needs a companion for wheelchair-bound Klara, Heidi's small following on the mountain suffers her loss. It was startling how much I remembered. I, who have trouble remembering details from a book I read last month, remembered the white rolls, and the kittens, and what happened to the wheelchair; I remembered the hayloft beds (maybe because I wanted one so badly when I was little) and the wonderful goats' milk and the other bed behind the stove. And it was all still very, very sweet. Except for Peter. I was taken aback by what a nasty piece of work he had the potential to be. I remember loving Peter. Perhaps that was because of the other books, but here \u2013 here he is selfish and lazy and greedy, and a little stupid. He shakes his fists at the interloper on Heidi's time, and then there's the wheelchair incident; he did damage. He was a little scary. If he hadn't had the fear of capture put into him, and hadn't had the Alm-Uncle's influence curbing his behavior, it seems like he might have ended up a serious problem. Heidi is a type of little heroine which I tend to doubt is written much anymore. Everything impacts her personally, from the grandmother's blindness to the tribulations of the goats. She's a simple, entirely selfless child with no desire to be anything else. She's not clever, per se; she can learn and learn quickly when she wants to, but she'd rather be out romping with the goats than reading. Which, now that I think of it, very likely has a good deal to do with her decline in Frankfort with Klara: she went from having hours of exercise in the fresh air, along with a simple diet (very simple \u2013 I was a little shocked at the amount of bread and butter and cheese and milk, and the paucity of meat and green vegetables) to almost no exercise and three meals a day of rich food (with more processed flour, at that). No wonder the child felt poorly. It wasn't just homesickness and worry over the elderly folk on the mountain. The rest of the cast of characters were very satisfying. Peter's mother and grandmother were drawn as simple, grateful folk; I've been trying to remember what it was that I read in which the poor characters continually refused gifts, even of things they needed desperately, because they could not accept \"charity\"; Peter's family had no such compunctions, and the gifts they received did what they were supposed to do: they gave joy to the recipients and the givers. I loved the doctor and Klara's grandmother \u2013 they were beautifully drawn. I wanted to smack Klara's father a bit, or at least to find out what was so very important in his business life that he had to abandon his daughter to the servants and the aptly-named Frau Rottenmeier for months on end. The French maid was surprisingly bitchy (though I can't help but wonder if some of her comments weren't effectively translated; they were delivered as cutting remarks, but read like cryptic non sequiturs). The butler, Sebastian, was a love. And, last but not least, I enjoyed watching the grandfather show a bit more depth and three-dimensionality by the end of the book. The affection I have for the book remains intact. I love it when that happens.", "\u0647\u0640\u0640\u0627\u064a\u062f\u064a \u2665\u064a\u0628\u062f\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0627\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0633\u0639 \u0639\u0634\u0631 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0636\u0644 , \u0648 \u0627\u0638\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0646\u0641\u0647\u0627 \u0636\u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 , \u0641\u0647\u064a \u062a\u0635\u0644\u062d \u0644\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u064a\u063a\u0629 . \u062d\u0633\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0632\u0627\u062c\u064a \u0628\u0644 \u0648 \u0623\u0650\u0634\u0639\u0631\u062a\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b \u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u062e\u0631\u0649 . \" \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645 \u062a\u0644\u0645\u0639 \u0644\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0648 \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0629 , \u062b\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0649\u0621 \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u064a\u0636\u0627\u064b . \u0627\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u061f \u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0635\u0644\u062d \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u0633\u0621 \u0628\u062d\u064a\u062b \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u062b\u0645\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0639 \u0644\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0642 . \u0641\u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \""], "Always Enough: God's Miraculous Provision Among the Poorest Children on Earth": ["Love this book. It shows the miraculous provision of GOD. Yes, I do believe miracles still happen today.

To the degree that you are intimate with Him, you will know what to do, what you must do.\" I know this to be true and am striving for a more intimate relationship daily. Also, they stress that there is no formula or mission strategy. They give the people they meet the living Jesus, by loving them. \"We came to love the poorest of the poor into the Kingdom, not promise them a cheap road to health and wealth.\" \"He calls me to love every single person I see every single day.\"", "Always Enough tells the story of Rolland and Heidi Baker's ministry to the nation of Mozambique. From small beginnings with a run-down orphanage, they have started a movement that planted 5,000 churches in ~6 years. Their amazing work is a testimony to the grace and mercy of God and continues to this day. So, what's the book like?Roughly alternating between Rolland and Heidi, the book begins with descriptions of their early lives and briefly details their work in Hong Kong and London; the main focus, however, is Mozambique. Mainly narrative, the story is interspersed with testimonies, diary entries and encouragement/challenges to the reader.The content is really, really good, but I felt it wasn't arranged to its full potential. Also, some details, such as where their resources come from, would have been interesting to read. They mention donations, and frequently mention miracles, such as when they fed 100 orphans from one pot of chilli; however, some information on the non-miraculous, \"mundane\" nitty-gritty of their ministry would have really added to the information.I get the impression this book is more of a summing up of their ministry in Mozambique (up to the date of writing), encouraging and challenging the reader. I believe they have written other, more narrative books, but this one really gives you the broad idea of God's amazing work in Mozambique through their ministry. If you want to be challenged, amazed, and knocked down by God's love, I highly recommend this book.", "This is one of the most life-changing, life impacting books I've ever read. Heidi and Rolland are radical lovers of God who have lived in garbage dumps and shacks all across Mozambique, taking in thousands and thousands of orphans with no way of taking care of them. They depend on Jesus every day to be all that they need...and He shows up and multiplies food daily, raises the dead, opens blind eyes and ears...etc. You can't come away without your heart being broken for the orphans and the widows.", "An interesting, and inspiring, testimony of the Bakers' years serving the Lord in Mozambique. However, as much as I would love to see such revival and works of the Lord happen in America, unfortunately we are not nearly as needy as those in Mozambique. I am not sure American believers WANT to be in such dire straits so as to see such miracles as the Baker's describe in this book.", "It urns out, I'd read this book before I got it. The fine print inside reveals \" Originally published under the title 'There is Always Enough'.\" So, don't buy both. Either is fine.", "One of my favorite books about God's power and His desire to lift the lowly out of the ash heaps. It's an inspiring book that I've read several times and plan on reading again.", "Wow ... this books is so so good.Rolland & Heidi Baker outline the early days of their relationship, their awakening to Christ's incredible love for them and the start of their ministry work in Mozambique. Heidi asked for a nation to minister to and the Lord gave them Mozambique. Their story demonstrates that old chestnut that the Lord simply desires those who are available. Those who make themselves available will be used and through daily surrender will be used extraordinarily.We get to see the sparseness and poverty of the people they love amongst, how the Lord uses them to powerfully demonstrate His love for the brokenhearted, poor and needy. We experience miracle after miracle as people are raised from the dead, the blind given sight, the deaf the ability to hear ... God wants to do all this and more. But it's not just the Bakers who are the conduits of Christ's love; far from it, the many pastors of the thousands of churches that have been established are also the conduit for Christ's miracles.It is a powerfully convicting life the Bakers are living. The power they experience but also the battles, the personal illnesses and devastation that the enemy throws at them like hundred-year old floods that set the country back decades. But through all of it we see an immense love, the Bakers for Jesus and Jesus for the Bakers. I want what they have.Be warned. Reading this book will challenge you to a life of daily surrender to Jesus.", "A friend stopped by to give me this book over the weekend. I read the first chapter the first night and it so captivated my attention that it leap-frogged my to-read pile and I finished it in two days. The stories of God's miraculous provision, healings, and restoration of children inspired and challenged me. Think Acts meets Mozambique. I give it four stars only because the later chapters dragged a little for me. Not because they weren't amazing stories, but I think I hit what Donald Maass calls the \"churning of emotions\": getting weary of revisiting the same emotion (in this case, equal parts compassion and awe) over and over. But I'd definitely recommend this title to anyone who wants to know if the Holy Spirit is still active and powerful in our world today, or who wants to be challenged to live sold-out for God's kingdom.", "I really enjoyed reading about what God has done/is doing through the Baker's ministry; a lot of the testimonials were excellent.I was not so much a fan of some of the written style: Often it seemed they were trying to get across the major difficulties faced by the nation on a large scale, but generally in a way completely lacking in style. Undoubtedly, the attempt was to show these trails on the large, national, scale - yet I often felt like I was merely reading lists of statistics rather than seeing the graphic depiction (I think they were going for), which would have more readily drawn the reader in to the reality of the situation. They did subsidize the statistics with more personal testimonials (as I mentioned above), which were really what kept the book going most of the time.The other aspect of the written style I was not a fan of was that I often felt like the author (mainly Heidi (she and Rolland wrote chapters off and on)) was often too 'preachy.' I get that the point is to motivate the reader into action, but most people reading a book like this are already people who want to be in the action, besides, most of the content of testimonials is fairly challenging to the average Christian reader as it is.", "I don't know how to understand this book. If everything is as clear-cut as the authors say it is, then much of what has happened in their ministry is absolutely amazing. However, the experience of 99.999% of the people I know who honestly love God and love others would argue that things don't always go the way that the Bakers say they do. Why not? That's something I really want to understand, but not something that was answered at all by this book.A second, seperate issue I had was the constant descriptions of just how miserable and pathetic everyone they helped was. What is the point of dwelling on their misery? Did they get permission from these people to write such negative, personal things about them before putting it in a book for the whole world to see? For me there was far too much \"these people were so bad off until we came and saved them\" and far too little indication of genuine friendship and mutuality among the people they went to serve with. It's certainly possible that their ministry didn't look so one-sided - but the book makes it feel that way."], "Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words": ["I read this book two times in about six months, so I think I'm done with the cover to cover work. I have it marked and highlighted and handy for reference. Along with discussions of spelling and usage, Bryson includes many examples of incorrect usage from well-known publications and authors (including his very august self). The examples let you see what it looks like when it's done wrong, and you may recognize your own errors in those of other people. It's also nice to know that even the professionals make mistakes and get away with it. Best of all, Bryson reminds us that English is a blissfully messy and uncooperative language. He encourages writers to ignore convention and flout the rules if they choose, provided they know what those rules are prior to breaking them. (If you're going to screw up, be sure it's intentional.) Not even the experts can agree all of the time on what is right, so Bill Bryson humbly offers us this book as \"a compilation of suggestions, observations, and even treasured prejudices.\" It's worth having on hand if you're a word geek with a lousy memory like me. I refer to it frequently.", "I taught middle school grammar for six years, and my favorite part of the grammar book (didn't you have a favorite part of the middle school grammar book?) was always the glossary of usage. I saved that part of the curriculum for the end of the year, like a desert that you look forward to throughout a long meal. \"Class, do you know when to use 'fewer' instead of 'less'? No? Oh, goodie.\"After the joyful experience I had reading A Short History of Nearly Everything, I wanted to check out more Bryson, and when I saw this title, I knew I was going for it. This book is just what it says it is, a dictionary, and it is arranged as such. So I started with the \"a/an\" entry and went along all the way through\"z\" and onto the appendix. It would take a pedant to write such a book, and Bryson does not disappoint. Some people might find his points to be esoteric and his tone to be that of a humorless martinet. I sure did, and I loved just about every minute of it. Here's what I learned.1. I make many, many mistakes in my writing. Bryson could look at the four short paragraphs above and find multiple errors in usage. Look! I misspelled \"dessert!\" The comma after \"title\" in the third paragraph is suspect. I could have used hyphens to introduce the non-essential phrase (\"a dictionary\") instead of commas. Bryson's disapproving voice reverberates in my mind every time I write a sentence.2. It's okay to end your sentence with a preposition. If you are the kind of person who will break his back to avoid ending your sentence with one of these offenders (or, like me, even ending with a prepositional phrase), you need to get over yourself. There's nothing wrong with it, and the rule you are following has been deemed unnecessary for over a hundred years.3. You should read his rule on when to use \"shall\" versus \"will.\" Authorities have been trying to pin down the vagaries and nuances of \"shall\" and \"will\" since the seventeenth century... The gist of what they have to say is that either you understand the distinctions instinctively or you do not; that if you don't, you probably never will; and that if you do, you don't need to be told anyway.4. The show Good Morning America should be called Good Morning, America. Of course it should.", "I might be starting towards lexophilia, but this book is the only dictionary/ thesaurus that I can seriously read. That is sit and read through it one word at a time. The only disadvantage is that it tends to make one nervous in one's own writing and want to check everything with Bryson just in case you have just made another almighty clanger.It was given to my by a lovely friend and it has proven to be a delight, you can't categorize it well, it isn't really a dictionary and it's not a thesaurus either. It is a 'get out of jail free card' for those of us who would prefer to avoid making stupid mistakes in our writing. More to the point, even if you are feeling bad, Bryson will have an example of a more famous author, journalist or copywriter who has dropped the same clanger and one can at least relax in the knowledge that one is in good company.If you write anything ,for anyone in the English language then this book should be on your shelf, or better still next to your keyboard.", "This book definitely earns a 5 star rating, I'm just not sure who to recommend it to:Professional writers and grammar nerds will love the book's utility; this is a resource I know I'll be returning to often. For example, if all I'm trying to do is spell or define a word then I'll pull out a basic dictionary. But what if three different words seem to have identical definitions, are there situations I'm supposed to use one word over another? Or let's say I see several respected publications handle a stylistic/grammatical choice differently, whose example do I follow? What if the experts throughout history have disagreed? Or what if modern usage differs from those expert resources? What if various countries use the same word in different ways? Bryson's guide helps to navigate these types of tricky questions. Bryson doesn't care about following rules for the sake of following rules. This is not an arbitrary style guide. No, this book has the sole purpose of improving one's writing by taking away those things that are incorrect, confusing, or misleading. I'm paraphrasing here but the the reader should never have to re-trace their steps to figure out a sentence. The reader should be able to get from A to B with as little resistance as possible, that's what good writing is all about [certainly in journalism, anyway].I could also recommend this book to the non-writers, non-grammar-nerds. Bryson has written a really accessible book, it's not bogged down with linguistic jargon and it always presents the ideas in an entertaining and easy-to-understand way. Even though it functions as a dictionary, I really enjoyed reading it from cover to cover. Bryson's breezy commentary makes the reading experience feel more like grabbing coffee with your brilliant writer friend than going to the library to crack open a dusty tome. Just saying, good stuff.I would also recommend this book to anyone who fully reads the title of the book. I'm seeing negative goodreads reviews because the person was expecting something like his travelogue humor. Hmm. So just be clear, this book only, but masterfully, delivers what the front cover claims it will deliver: a dictionary of troublesome words for writers who want to get it right.", "This is a brilliant little book amd a must read/desk companion for professional writers. Arranged alphabetically, it basically explains correct spellings, etymology and meanings of various words and the mistakes that even lovers of words and writing can make. For example when to use compliment or complement; when to parlay or attend a parley. He explains the real meaning of condone (which is not to approve or endorse but to forgive - whoops!) and takes his time over who and whom. He also explains a range of tautologies, redundancies (past history!) and misspellings - basically, the common errors that even the best writers can make. It's fun (a wee bit shocking and embarrassing) to flick through and realize you have committed a particular lexical sin, amd more than once, but in typical Bryson fashion, it's also terrific to read cover to cover. This is a book that will never stray far from my desk. Promise.", "I really enjoyed this, but then I do sometimes read the dictionary for fun. I found Bryson\u2019s expectations of correct usage to be insightful and realistic. I appreciate his examples of incorrect usage.An example of something I have applied to my own writing is the entry for include. He writes, \"include indicates that what is to follow is only part of a greater whole. To use it when you are describing a totality is sloppy, as here: \u201cThe 630 job losses include 300 in Redcar and 330 in Port Talbot\u201d (Times). No one ever pointed that out to me before. Thank you, Mr. Bryson!", "I think I'm in love. Be still, my geeky, grammar- and word-loving heart! I had the satisfying experience of coming across entries that reinforced my own pet peeves (e.g. the misuse of 'fulsome,' the confusion of 'tortuous' and 'torturous'). But still more satisfyingly, I learned plenty more that I did not already knew, and also learned explanations for things that I knew only by instinct. Marvellous!", "As this is a reference book, only the most committed logophile will read it from cover to cover.The book has one section, \"Troublesome Words\", and an appendix, \"Punctuation\".What makes this guide to correct English stand out from the cluttered shelves of similar books is two things. Bryson delivers his advice with his trademark humor that readers of any of his other books will immediately recognize. That itself leads to the second point \u2014 Bryson isn't some grammarian tucked away in the dusty stacks of an overstocked library, he's one of the most skilled and loved writers of modern English.Any writer or logophile will want to add this guide to their collection.", "Excellent book. There was much here I just didn't know, and a lot of other material that I might once have known but had forgotten. I actually read through the entire thing, although it would be a great browsing book for anyone who wants to write or who just loves langauge. I got several blog posts out of the interesting material I found within.", "In my quest to read all of Mr. Bryson's books, some are easier than others. But I have to say that, for a grammar nerd who loves words, this was a joy. It did take me a long time as I didn't want to read too much at once for fear it would run out of my ears, but I learned a lot and I will be hanging onto this as a reference book for a long time to come.Did you know the phrase is to the manner born, not manor? Oops. Me neither. Did you know a koala is not a koala bear? That one I did learn last year while preparing to visit Australia. How about that there is no such thing as one kudo? You give someone kudos or none at all. Luckily for all of us, Mr. Bryson has pulled together here a comprehensive list of the most commonly misused (\"As U.S. travel abroad drops, Europe grieves\" -New York Times. Really? Grieves?), misunderstood (grisly vs. grizzly), and overused words and phrases (lion's share) in writing.As Mr. Bryson was a copyeditor at Penguin in the U.K., once or twice I did wonder if his use of a word was British, however he does note differences in American and British usage (if not spelling, and the spelling throughout and punctuation are American) so I think my guesses about those Brit-isms are likely wrong. But it is worth noting that he does elucidate a lot of British place names that an American will never need to know. However that minor inconvenience is not good reason to ignore this book. I love how he comes down on the side of reason and sense over rules and traditions (it is okay to split an infinitive, as well as end a sentence with a preposition!) but he has done his homework and cites multiple sources for any debate, and even tries to find the originator of those rather random grammar \"rules,\" to point out how recent and ill-founded they are.So if you've ever wondered when to use \"on to\" instead of \"onto\" or whether it is better to use \"flammable\" or \"inflammable\" when talking about a thing easily lit on fire, Mr. Bryson has you covered. If you find this book cursory and wish it were more comprehensive, he's got you covered with Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors. But if you actually want to read a dictionary straight through and retain any of it, I recommend starting with this thinner volume. And if you just love words and language, you need to check out Made in America: An Informal History of the English Language in the United States and The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way."], "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)": ["I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?

She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's \"New Releases\" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.The end.Or rather, the beginning.", "I'm on page 27.

Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It \"ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.\" There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione. Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. Go ahead, I dare you. Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid.

I read it during my first English learning stages (after about 9 months of English courses during high school) because the language was so very easy to understand. It was quite entertaining, sure, especially the first three books, but it didn't have a lot of substance. I could easily name a couple of children's fantasy books (not to mention adult ones) I found much more challenging and enthralling than Harry Potter. I guess, I just don't really understand where all the hype is coming from. Actually I thought that from the fourth book onwards the books lost a lot of zeal and became longer and, well, lengthy, too. I lost interest during the fifth book and didn't even start the rest. So, altogether, definitely not bad, but not really special, either. The huge success of this series is probably just one of the things that's always going to be a mystery to me (besides the clever merchandising, of course).", "Great to have this amazing collection, especially amazing because you can read and reread these books and share with kids and grandkids.", "The series is so eminently readable, it's hard to put down.

My personal high-water mark is Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, a French arthouse movie with impeccable credentials that just happened to show Emmanuelle B\u00e9art nude for about half of its 228 running minutes. (It's completely justified, given that the story is about the relationship between the artist and his model. Anything else would have been dishonest, don't you see?) But if you're a left-leaning person who also likes guns, this book may go one better. McPhee, an American journalist with a talent for finding good stories, describes a society based on unexceptionable ideals of peace and neutrality, which has pursued them so successfully that it hasn't been involved in a war with another country since 1516. He then spends the book arguing, with considerable plausibility, that Switzerland has only been able to afford such highflown ideals by developing an extraordinarily ferocious part-time militia and arming itself to the teeth. It's depressing news if you believe in turning the other cheek. But if you're more a believer into doing unto others as they would do unto you but doing it first, you're going to like his message. McPhee has had a fine time as an observer with the Swiss Army, and tells you all about the ingenious ways in which the Swiss have learned to use their country's unusual topography to maximal advantage. The Alps, all on their own, form a brilliant first line of defence; there are only a few ways into Switzerland from most directions, and all the passes, tunnels and bridges are mined so that they can be blown to pieces at the touch of a button. There are supposed to be concealed military facilities everywhere, most of them buried in those same mountains. If we're to believe what he's telling us, your average blank Swiss rock face has at least a couple of camouflaged doors, which can be hiding anything from entrances to subterranean hospitals, to heavy artillery, to state-of-the-art fighter-bombers. And all deployable at a moment's notice.I admit to a mean-spirited inner voice that's urging me to be skeptical. All of this is supposed to be classified, it says, so maybe his figures are inflated; he seems to have got very friendly with his hosts, and as far as I can see takes everything they tell him at face value. Maybe they thought he'd be a handy conduit for some pro-Swiss propaganda. But I'm ordering Doubting Thomas to keep his mouth shut. A politically correct version of Team America: World Police with better hardware: how can you resist that? I hope every word of it is true.", "I begin to see why The Quiet Man loves John McPhee so much- the man is amazing, plain and simple and is fast becoming one of my favorite writers. While Encounters With The Arch Druid was a fascinating look at the impact of development on the unspoiled wildernesses of America, La Place de La Concorde Suisse plunges the reader into the fascinating world of Switzerland- and their army.When one thinks of Switzerland, you don't really think of it as being an overly militaristic place. Dodgy banking regulations, excellent cheese and chocolate, crazy good watches and that fantastically neon currency of theirs, yes- but military prowess? Military power? Not so much.And that's precisely the way the Swiss like it. McPhee tags along with a variety of citizen soldiers (as all Swiss Citizens have to do stints in the army) and explores the origins of the Swiss Army, how it came to be so important and such a vital party of the national fabric of Switzerland and slowly reveals just how expensive and costly an attempt to conquer Switzerland might be for someone.Basically, the Swiss became the best soldiers because they had to be. Sitting in the middle of Europe they've had various hungry empires, Emperors and countries eye them up from time to time so defense of the Cantons that make up the Swiss Confederation became extremely important. They quickly developed a reputation as being the best mercenaries in Europe (because if you don't have a lot of fighting to do at home, you might as well get lots of practice abroad...) and the Vatican picked up some Swiss Mercenaries a few centuries back and has kept them- go to the Vatican and you'll see the famous Swiss Guards there to this day.(Interesting bit of legal chicanery I didn't know: all Swiss mercenaries apparently had a loophole in their contracts- if Switzerland was attacked, they went home automatically to defend it. So as many countries came to rely on and use Swiss mercenaries frequently, the idea of attacking the place could kind of screw one over, depending on how many Swiss mercenaries you used.)The entire Swiss military philosophy has been built around the idea of convincing various power-hungry countries that invading Switzerland would be so costly in terms of money and blood that it just isn't worth it. The geography helps a lot- as who wants to try and get an army through the Alps? But the fanatical devotion to the preservation of country and the sheer amount of practice means that the Swiss as a nation are very well trained (in as close to live-fire conditions as they can manage) and have obssessively planned for every possible eventuality. It also helps that their entire infrastructure is wired to blow in the event of an invasion- from chunks of bridges designed to collapse to rockslides waiting to be triggered to airstrips high in the Alps- they're ready for anything.True story: my Godparents live in Switzerland not far from Geneva and in their basement is an honest to goodness nuclear fallout shelter. All Swiss houses have them- and McPhee hints that there are probably whole complexes buried beneath the Alps in case of nuclear war. If that happens someday- which I hope it doesn't- I have no doubt it'll be the Swiss that will be rebuilding civilization.(Another thing I didn't know: Switzerland only appoints Generals in times of grave national Emergency- so far, there have been four of them.)Overall: Fascinating, just fascinating- a portrait of a country so devoted to preserving it's neutrality and protecting its own that it's one of the most quietly militarized societies on Earth. McPhee does it again- I felt like I was reading a novel packed to the brim with delicious knowledge cookies. McPhee wrote my face off- and yes, I do want to read more of him. If you haven't read this brilliant writer yet, you don't know what you're missing.", "Long before the phenomenal success of books like \"Longitude\" and \"Cod\", John McPhee perfected the art of the 'single topic in depth' book, in many cases expanding on his trademark (long) New Yorker essays. In \"La Place de la Concorde Suisse\", he digs below the picture-postcard prettiness and deceptive blandness of Switzerland and its people to deliver a fascinating (and slightly sinister) portrait of the Swiss Army. One of his most interesting books, written before he gave himself over to the fascination with geology that has inspired many of his more recent efforts. To say that McPhee writes well is a gross understatement. He is the literary father of Malcolm Gladwell, with the same characteristic ability to take an apparently abstruse topic and write about it with extraordinary lucidity, weaving a fascinating story that draws the reader in and holds the attention right to the end. If you haven't read any of McPhee's work, this would a good book to start with. Other favorites of mine include \"The Crofter and the Laird\", \"The Headmaster\", or either of the collections \"Giving Good Weight\" and \"The John McPhee Reader\".", "As a New Yorker staff writer, McPhee\u2019s written many classics of long-form journalism, which I have been slowly trying to get through over the years. Fortunately, one of my customers this summer was married to a man who had just written his PhD thesis on McPhee, and who was looking to unload some trade paperback copies of McPhee\u2019s books before moving to a new university, giving me the chance to check a few articles off my list. This book is about Switzerland, the \u201cArmy with a Country,\u201d which has hidden guns covering every strategic corner, has every bridge and tunnel rigged to blow up, has massive basses hidden within mountains, and which calls back all citizens, from plumbers in Germany to CEOs in New York, back every year to train. Interestingly, while all Swiss are required to keep a gun at home after finishing their time as conscripts, using the guns is strictly forbidden. Much of this book/piece consists of McPhee walking around Switzerland with a Franchoponic reconnaissance patrol consisting of reservist troublemakers (the NCO is a vintner who meant to pull a practice grenade off his superior\u2019s tunic, but accidentally left the pin attached to the tunic), who report on the transportation capability of various roads, bridges, and hidden passages. In the memorable final scene, the patrol climbs a mountain while reporting on a faux Soviet attack (when this book as written, in the 80s, the Warsaw Pact was seen as the only true possible enemy), while stopping for drinks and snacks. At the very end, the patrol, which is ostensibly standing in a field, but really drinking in a summit bar (the farmers sitting nearby are making mooing sounds), reports the detonation of a \u201cpetit bombe atomique.\u201d", "John McPhee is my favorite writer, and with this, I've now read every single one of his books. All 31. I can't wait to read them all again.", "Hysterical, lighthearted, and beautifully written, but If you're like me you'll feel like a lot of the jokes go over your head because they're over your tax bracket.", "This book was the result of a tour John McPhee made of Switzerland back in the day, following a band of Swiss men on their yearly volunteer service in the Swiss Army. It is amazing how much you can learn while being totally entertained by a piece of writing. I find that I often learn new facts from the books I read, whether I'm aware of it or not; the trouble is, with novels, you can never be entirely sure if a presented piece of information is actually true. Not so with nonfiction, and especially when it comes to John McPhee! On a visit to Switzerland a few years ago I asked a Swiss friend of mine if he knew that many of the bridges in his country were rigged to blow up in the event of an invasion. He didn't. But I sure did!There are many remarkable elements to McPhee's writing. One that I think is under-appreciated is his humor. It is always delivered without drawing attention to itself in a way that makes you wonder if McPhee knows he is being funny (of course, though, he always knows). Take the following passage:Hentsch belongs to one of the most august and ancient private-banking families in Geneva. On his own, he has become well known for his resourceful development of new accounts. He manages portfolios. He says that he is like a priest, in that he must know his customers well in order to serve them. Less than a week ago, he was in Portland, Maine, buying lobsters. Last year, he bought twenty-five thousand lobsters, importing them through Zurich into Sweden. Of service in the Swiss Army, he says, \"It belongs to the passport.\" And apropos of nothing at all he adds, \"We are nice people. Not everyone understands that.\"If you didn't crack a smile at that end of that, don't read this book. Watch \"Grey's Anatomy\" or something.", "A typically McPhee-ian account of the Swiss Army, which has managed to keep its country out of wars for at least the last 400 years--no mean feat when you consider that most of the neighboring countries have been at each other's throats for at least half of those 400 years (okay, it's a rough estimate). Written with McPhee's usual bone-dry humor and laced with the kinds of McPhee-style factoids that you can use to spice up a particularly dull Thanksgiving dinner, it's a provocative little book that actually makes you think about some things that you'd never really thought about thinking about before.", "Quick, short read about the enigmatic, but strangely effective, Swiss military.", "A 162 page New Yorker article from 1983 about the Swiss Army. \"Switzerland doesn't have an army. Switzerland is an army.\""], "The Heidi Chronicles": ["One of my reading themes in 2016, that I hope to continue in 2017, has been to read more classic plays. It is in this regard that I selected Wendy Wasserstein's The Heidi Chronicles, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1988. Wasserstein had previously wrote for the Seattle Repertory Company and penned two other plays- An Uncommon Woman and A Life Imagined. Heidi was her first play to win multiple awards and enjoy long success on Broadway. The Heidi Chronicles details twenty five years in the life of Dr. Heidi Holland, professor of art history. Heidi becomes an archetype of the baby boom era who went from campaigning for Eugene McCarthy to demanding equality for women in the work place and at home. Along the way, we meet other characters who share Heidi's journey in life: Susan who is Heidi's closest friend and cracks the glass ceiling in the working world; Scoop Rosenbaum an entrepreneur who loves Heidi but can not marry her because she would rather achieve at work than at home; and Peter Patrone, Heidi's first love who becomes a successful pediatrician and then turns out to be gay. These four characters become representative of the baby boom era that is still achieving today. In the course of 80 pages of dialogue, it is clear that Wasserstein diligently took the time to research Heidi's character. We learn of lesser known female painters who had to take a back seat to famous men in society; most evident is Lilly Cabot who at a time lived next door to Monet and learned from the French master. What Heidi hoped to achieve in the art world was to eradicate the gap between men and women so that Lilly Cabot is as well known as Claude Monet. This is apparent with Wasserstein's other characters as well. Susan makes inroads in producing sitcoms, Lisa publishes children's books, and April hosts Hello, New York. All of these gains occurred in the 1980s while the glass ceiling was first beginning to crack. What did not work for me and lowered my rating was the depiction of the male characters in the play. In order to get Heidi to achieve, Wasserstein created two ex-lovers who maintained traits negative enough for Heidi to reject them. Scoop Rosenbaum desired a spouse who would not compete with him. Lisa Friedlander desired a family and was happy taking a back seat to her husband, so she was marriageable material; Heidi, who loved Scoop dearly but wanted a successful career, was not. Peter also loved Heidi for a quarter century but turns out to be gay. In the 21st century, Scoop and Heidi would be considered a power couple. In the mid 1980s, however, Heidi impedes Scoop rise to stardom, thus dating the play thirty years back. The Heidi Chronicles remains a poignant study of the feminist side to the baby boom generation. I enjoyed reading how women of my mother's generation began to crack into the mythical glass ceiling in many facets of the working world. Yet, from its depiction of men, I believe the play not to be as timeless as some of the other plays I have read this year. Heidi was deserving of the Pulitzer upon its release in 1988, and I glad that I took the time to study it. Worthy of this award, I rate The Heidi Chronicles 4 stars.", "I liked this play a lot more before I read my Women in Theater professor's article about it. Then all of a sudden all its flaws became pretty clear. Nonetheless, my favorite thing about it, the dialogue, remained unchallenged, so that's okay.Heidi was an interesting main character in that she is often portrayed as responding to things happening around her rather than actively engaging in them herself. As a way to highlight the different stages of the second wave feminist movement (stages Heidi sees her friends enacting) this wasn't a bad choice.Also, as far as dialogue is concerned, the play read very naturally. \"I know some of these people,\" I kept telling myself, mainly because I could hear their lines so vividly in my head.And Heidi's an art historian. Yes.", "I'm on a bit of a Wendy Wasserstein kick. This play won the Pulitzer Prize and the Tony in 1989. Even though the play is over 20 years old, the themes presented are still valid.", "The Heidi Chronicles is a coming of age novel that leaves the reader feeling empty, disappointed and more than a little depressed. The main character comes of age during a time of change and movement from the time spanning the 1960's-to the early 90's. With all of this change surrounding her Heidi feels compelled to action and finds herself fiercely advocating for the representation of women in art. However through all of this she finds herself lonely and unfulfilled. Her romantic life center mainly around two men, Peter Patron and Scoop Rosenbaum, however each one has a surprise for her. Besides the fact that I hated the main character the story itself was pretty good I guess. GUESS being the operative word. The play is a disjointed mess, that lacked the fluidity which most readers (or viewers) need in order to keep up with the story. The so called \"witty banter\" reeked of forced artsyness and I felt an extreme disappointment that this play had won awards and was considered great American writing. But maybe the play actually would be good for somebody who was 16 in 1965 and could understand all the references. OH THE REFERENCES!!! Without a proper understanding of these references it's impossible to garner any sort of appreciation for the book and that in itself is a problem. It doesn't have the timelessness of a true play (cough cough...SHAKESPEARE...cough cough OSCAR WILDE). And therefore god willing it will slip quietly into oblivion within the next decade or so.", "Wow. Amazing. \"The Heidi Chronicles\" captivated me in ways I never expected! This witty, fast-paced and enchanting play culminates with a chilling reality about careers, love, marriage, friendship and the ups and downs of life. \"The Heidi Chronicles\" resonated with me on so many levels and I look forward to seeing it on stage soon. Better yet, I look forward to someday portraying Heidi on stage. Highly recommend.", "I listened to the audio version of the play from Library2Go. The story was pretty good. Enjoyed the interview with the author at the end.", "I adore Wendy Wasserstein's work and this is my favorite. I'v always wanted to play Peter in a production. A great look a life!", "A pulitzer prize winning play for the feminist Vassar and Brown crowd.", "I'm not big on plays, but I really liked this one. The thing that attracted me initially was the synopsis - finding myself and trying to be true to myself (as cliche as it sounds) are things I have always thought about. But I definitely found much more in this play.People argue if this work is still relevant, they talk about feminism and how it's different today. I do agree that this work is about the specific situation of a middle-class woman in that specific time and I wouldn't say that one can just change some details and, voila, the play would be as if set today. (The dialogue alone both between Heidi and Scoop or Peter and Heidi and Fran or Susan would go quite differently today.) But, although significant improvements on women's rights have been made, I would say the question of \"having it all\" is still very much on the table (or the question of having equal opportunities if we're talking in terms of class). We as people are still trying to find ourselves, wanting to find our own voices, but also wanting to be a part of a larger group, to find acceptance, but also be content with ourselves.But it's not only about being relevant, it does and has more than that. The play serves as a historical view on feminism and its problems back then, it is a play where the sentiment that was present in the lives of many women was finally put on paper and then the stage. And it has such snappy and witty dialogues that to me they seemed as good and important as the subject matter itself. I'm not going to go into an analysis of the text itself as there are definitely more competent people out there doing just that, but there is one more thing I would like to say about the matter at hand and things around it. The women in this play fight for having it all, but the content of \"having it all\" is not the same for every woman (or every man, for that matter). The play seems to be more about the women being in this together (or, as it turns out, not being together), but it seems to me it also brings up a question of separateness in this togetherness. That is still a question worth considering. And this is still a play worth reading.", "Some plays read better than others; this is one I think needs the nuance of voice and facial expressions to help with comprehension. I can't believe I've never seen this performed! Anyway, there are bits I'm just not sure I understood, characters I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to feel about. But the language is so spot on and the banter is so real...I trust that, when seen and heard, all would be revealed.As an aside, I also find amusing the fact that this reads, and strongly, as a period piece now, when it was actually set in the then near future when first performed."], "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)": ["The universe is a joke. Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey. Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.It's just is a joke, but some of us are in on it.", "In my experience, readers either love Adams' books or quickly put them down. I, for example, quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page, and have read the Hitchhiker's Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized. But both my wife and father couldn't get past book one: the former because she found it too silly, and the latter because he found the writing to be more about \"the author's personality\" than plot and character. Whatever.The first three books in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, the Universe and Everything--are inspired lunacy. The ideas, plots, puns, jokes, and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers, but people from all fields. For instance: the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one; you can find dozens of recipes online for Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters; the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in 1989 was named after a computer in book one; and seriously, who hasn't heard that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42? (For more of these, consult wikipedia.org's entry on \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References\".) Chances are, if you're reading these books for the first time, you'll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams' creations.The books aren't, of course, without their problems. Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had, and I paraphrase, a long beginning, a long conclusion, and not much in the middle (though I can't remember where I read that). He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out one-liners. The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines, and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics. Despite this, the Hitchhiker's Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books I've ever read--a position they've occupied for some fifteen years. Adams' wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness, and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly, consistently make me howl with laughter (the other being Terry Pratchett). Readers beware: if the Adams bug infects you, you will have it for life. And you'll never be sorry you let it bite.", "Another classic. If you don't like this series, you probably put your babel fish in the wrong hole. You are the reason that human beings are only the third most intelligent species on earth behind mice and dolphins.

With the plethora of wonderful reviews already written for this book by my fellow GRs, I decided instead to provide some helpful, practical advice on why reading this book might benefit my fellow goodreaders. Therefore, as both life management tool and a safety warning, I have compiled my: Top 5 Reasons Why You Should Read Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy:..\nNumber 5\n: It\u2019s a pleasant diversion to keep your mind occupied and pass the time while you are getting electrolysis to remove those areas patches blankets of unwanted hair: \n \u2026Yikes, somebody please get that man a Klondike Bar.\nNumber 4\n: The book is smart, funny, well-written and full of wonderful commentary on the human condition and clever humor: \n \u2026The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.\t\u2026 \u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\u2019\t\t\u2018Why, what did she tell you?\u2019\t\t\u2018I don't know, I didn't listen.\u2019\u2026 Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God. The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, \u2018for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 says Man, \u2018The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.\u2019 \u2018Oh dear,\u2019 says God, \u2018I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic.\t \u2026For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.

And finally\u2026.Number 1: Understanding the deep, nuanced meaning at the heart of this novel will help better prepare you should you ever find yourself in a situation like this:\n Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late\u2026for yourself and your loved ones, read The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy today. If through sharing the above bit of meaningless nonsense wisdom, I have: (i) introduced someone to a worthwhile read, or (ii)provided a means of dealing with the agonizing pain of having chunks of fur ripped from their body, or (iii) shown people a picture of a man in a thong changing a tire, or (iv) pissed off a despotic assclown, or (v) simply provided a safety tip regarding avoiding unsolicited sexual advances in the guise of impromptu gift-giving, than I feel I have accomplished something. I only did this because I had a collection of funny pics and couldn\u2019t figure out what else to do with them so I bootstrapped them in to a review I care.3.5 stars.", "Please, before anything... DON'T PANIC.This review is harmless, well mostly harmless.I think that one of the things that one has to keep in mind while reading this book is that it was written in 1979. Having this important factor in perspective, it's quite astonishing the vision of Douglas Adams, the author, presenting a lot of visionary elements, starting with the very \"book inside the book\", I mean The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, since it's presented as an electronic book. which now it's a very common way to read a lot of books now. Also, he mentioned stuff like \"touch-sensitive screens\" that yet again, it's now something introduced in our daily lives. Science-Fiction, the good science fiction is defined by being visionary in the moment to be published and a fact, years later. Just like Verne's work predicting events like space rockets and nuclear submarines.\nThe President of the Universe holds no real power. His sole purpose is to take attention away from where the power truly exists...\nObviously, beside the mesmering tecnology stuff that he predicted, the signature style here is his remarkable sense of humor, SMART sense of humor. In literature and pop culture in general, there were been unforgettable examples of computers like the cold HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the noble K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider, also robots like the loyal R2-D2 from Star Wars and the logical robots from I, Robot short story collection. However, nothing of that can prepare you to the experience of meeting \"Eddie\", the Main Computer of the Heart of Gold spaceship or Marvin, the Paranoid Android. This is one of the best traits of Douglas Adams' wit in the development of artificial intelligence. I wasn't surprised since some months ago, I read Shada by Gareth Roberts but based on the Doctor Who's unaired script written by Douglas Adams where you find another priceless example of a computer with a personality that only Adams is able to develop. You laugh and laugh with them BUT not only because they's funny but also they are truly logical as artifical intelligences in their way to react to situations. Adams' impact of how presenting artificial intelligence can be found too in another novel of Doctor Who, Festival of Death by Jonathan Morris, where the author showed how well he learned Adams' lessons.\nResistance is useless!\nI believe that Douglas Adams' involvement in the production of the iconic British sci-fi TV series Doctor Who as script editor and writer of three stories, it was fated since I found remarkable similarities on the premises of both works, this novel and the TV series. Both has a peculiar fellow who stole certain machine and along with companions is travelling around. So, it wouldn't a surprise that he got some inspiration since Doctor Who was widely known since 1963 specially on its native country, England. Of course, his participation on another British TV institution like Monty Python's Flying Circus was a relevant point for Adams to explode his humoristic potential.\nTo boldly split infinitives that no man had split before...\nIt's possible that people unfamiliar with Adams' work could think that since this is a novel with comedy, they could think that it can't be a \"serious\" science-fiction book. However, the brilliance of this novel is its capacity of offering smart humor while using scientific concepts like the theory of faster-than-light objects. Even you won't be able to fight against his priceless explanation behind the UFOs' sightings.Without spoiling anything, I think that my only reason of getting off a star in my rating of this great novel was its lacking a proper closure. I understand that this the first book in a trilogy of five books (yes, you read correctly, it wasn't a mistake) so the adventures and mysteries will continue in the second book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. However, it was quite unsettling when you are having the time of your life reading it and the book just stopped to have words. I describe it like that since I didn't feel an ending. It was indeed just like the impossibility of not finding more words in the book. What I can give to Adams is that that was quite improbable but in my opinion, quite unlikely way to just \"ending\" this book. Certainly I want to read the rest of this great \nTRILOGY\n of \nFIVE\n books. (Yes, yet again, you read well, and it isn't a mistake)", "This is not the best book ever written. It is unlikely to affect you on any deep emotional level and you probably won't spend sleepless nights just thinking about it.But it's a simple, humourous sci-fi adventure. It won't do something for everybody but I'm a massive fan of Douglas Adams' and his sense of humour. Come on, like it or not, Adams' has some awesomely quotable sayings (not all of these are from this exact book):\"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.\" \"For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much\u2014the wheel, New York, wars and so on\u2014whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man\u2014for precisely the same reasons.\"\"The Guide says there is an art to flying\", said Ford, \"or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\"\"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.\" \"Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?\" \"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.\"", "What can I say? I wish I had been in the movie, although it was bad and I guess I should be happy about NOT being in it.", "\u201cYou know,\" said Arthur, \"it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\"\"Why, what did she tell you?\"\"I don't know, I didn't listen.\u201d \n\nDid this make you laugh already? Fine, because the rest of Douglas Adams' famous novel includes many more of those humorous elements.I have a very difficult personal history with Sci-Fi novels; some of them I could appreciate but not enjoy; some I could appreciate but got bored with them very quickly; but The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was the first Sci-Fi novel which ever made me simultaneously appreciate, enjoy and even love the book. Love is a strong word, but if a book is filled with sentences like \u201cThe ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't\u201d or \u201cAnyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job\u201d or \u201cMy capacity for happiness you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first\u201d, then I simply can't help but fall in love with it.\n\n \u201cSo this is it,\" said Arthur, \"We are going to die.\"\"Yes,\" said Ford, \"except... no! Wait a minute!\" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. \"What's this switch?\" he cried.\"What? Where?\" cried Arthur, twisting round.\"No, I was only fooling,\" said Ford, \"we are going to die after all.\u201d\n\nI could go on and quote the entire book now, that's how much fun it was reading this and that's how quotable the book is. But Douglas Adams didn't only attempt (and succeed) to write this groundbreaking approach to the science fiction genre, he was also able to make you think a lot about several important questions: What is the meaning of life? Why do we live? Why do we die? What is the meaning of the Universe? Adams intentionally answers these questions in rather absurd ways, mainly because it is impossible to find ultimate answers and definitions for these topics. But those are all questions everyone has already asked themselves, and Adams isn't afraid to tackle them in a way that the reader can't help but laugh about it.\n\n \u201cFor instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much\u2014the wheel, New York, wars and so on\u2014whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man\u2014for precisely the same reasons.\u201d\n\nIf you haven't read this book yet, perhaps because you are afraid of the Sci-Fi genre (which I was as well, until I started my adventures with Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Marvin and all the others in this book): then don't hesitate to read it. But don't be mistaken, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is (probably) not the best book you will ever find, it is (probably) not going to make you cry because of its emotional intensity, it is (probably) not going to keep you on the edge of your seat due to its ming-bogglingly suspenseful plot. Adams' book is rather an episodic account of several random adventures in the cosmic space, and for me it was mostly Adams' writing style which it was impossible to resist. He lures his readers into the story and before you even realize it, you are probably already laughing.And don't forget to bring your towel!", "I hated this book.

Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings": ["Some will shout with joy, others will scream in derision. However, we can all agree on one thing:It's long.", "Writers who inspire a genre are usually misunderstood. Tolkien's reasons for writing were completely unlike those of the authors he inspired. He didn't have an audience, a genre, and scores of contemporaries. There was a tradition of high adventure fairy tales, as represented by Eddison, Dunsany, Morris, MacDonald, Haggard, and Kipling, but this was only part of what inspired Tolkien.His writing was chiefly influenced by his familiarity with the mythological traditions of the Norse and Welsh cultures. While he began by writing a fairy story with The Hobbit and other early drafts, his later work became a magical epic along the lines of the Eddas. As a translator, Tolkien was intimately knowledgeable with these stories, the myths behind them, and the languages that underpinned them, and endeavored to recreate their form.Contrarily, those who have followed in his footsteps since have tended to be inspired by a desire to imitate him. Yet they failed to do what Tolkien did because they did not have a whole world of mythic tradition, culture, and language to draw on. They mimicked his style, but did not understand his purpose, and hence produced merely empty facsimiles.If they had copied merely the sense of wonder or magnificence, then they might have created perfectly serviceable stories of adventure, but they also copied those parts of Tolkien which do not fit a well-built, exciting story--like his work's sheer length. Tolkien made it 'okay' for writers of fantasy to produce books a thousand pages long, and to write many of them in succession. Yet Tolkien's length had a purpose, it was not merely an affectation.Tolkien needed this length in order to reproduce myth. The Eddas were long and convoluted because they drew from many different stories and accounts, combined over time by numerous story-tellers and eventually compiled by scribes. The many digressions, conflicts, repetitions, asides, fables, songs, and minutiae of these stories came together organically. Each had a purpose, even if they didn't serve the story, they were part of a grand and strange world. Epics often served as encyclopedias for their age, teaching history, morals, laws, myth, and geography--as may be seen in Homer or The Bible.This was the purpose of all of Tolkien's long, dull songs, the litany of troop movements, the lines of lineage, the snippets of didactic myths, and side-adventures. To create a realistically deep and complicated world, he felt he needed to include as many diverging views as the original myths had. He was being true to a literary convention--though not a modern one, and not one we would call a 'genre'.He gave characters similar names to represent other historical traditions: that of common prefixes or suffixes, of a house line adopting similar names for fathers, sons, and brothers. An author who copies this style without that linguistic and cultural meaning just makes for a confusing story, breaking the sensible rule that main characters should not have similar names.Likewise, in a well-written story, side-characters should be kept to the minimum needed to move the plot and entertain the reader with a variety of personalities. It is another rule Tolkien breaks, because he is not interested in an exciting, driving pace. He wants the wealth of characters to match the number of unimportant side characters one would expect from a historical text.The only reason he sometimes gets away with breaking such sensible rules of storytelling is that he often has a purpose for breaking them, and is capable of drawing on his wealth of knowledge to instill further depth and richness in his world. Sometimes, when he slowed his story down with such asides, they did not have enough purpose to merit inclusion, a flaw in pacing which has only increased with modern authors.But underneath all of that, Tolkien does have an appealing and exciting story to tell, of war and succession and moral struggles--the same sort of story that has been found in our myths since the very earliest writings of man. He does not create a straight monomyth, because, like Milton, he presents a hero divided. Frodo takes after the Adam, placing strength in humility and piety, not martial might or wit. Aragorn is an attempt to save the warlike, aristocratic hero whom Milton criticized in his portrayal of Satan.Yet unlike Satan, we do not get an explanation of what makes Strider superior, worthy, or--more importantly--righteous. And in this, Tolkien's attempt to recreate the form of the Eddas is completely at odds with the Christian, romantic moral content with which he fills the story. This central schism makes his work much less true to the tradition than Anderson's \nThe Broken Sword\n, which was published the same year.Not only does Tolkien put forth a vision of chaste, humble, 'everyman' heroes who persevere against temptation through piety, he also presents a world of dualistic good and evil, of eternal, personal morality, prototypical of the Christian worldview, particularly the post-Miltonic view. His characters are bloodless, chaste, and noble--and if that nobility is sometimes that of simple, hard-working folk, all the better for his Merrie England analogue.More interesting than these is his portrayal of Gollum, one of the few characters with a deep psychological contradiction. In some ways, his central, conflicted role resembles Eddison's Lord Gro, whose work inspired Tolkien. But even this internal conflict is dualistic. Unlike Gro, Gollum is not a character with an alternative view of the world, but fluctuates between the hyperbolic highs and lows of Tolkien's morality.It is unfortunate that both good and evil seem to be external forces at work upon man, because it removes much of the agency and psychological depth of the characters. There is a hint of very alien morality in the out-of-place episode of Tom Bombadil, expressing the separation between man and fairy that Dunsany's work epitomized. Bombadil is the most notorious remainder of the fantastical roots of Tolkien's story which he painstakingly removed in editing in favor of Catholic symbology.Yet despite internal conflicts, there is something respectable in what he achieved, and no fantasy author has yet been capable of comprehending what Tolkien was trying to do and innovating upon it. The best modern writers of fantasy have instead avoided Tolkien, concentrating on other sources of inspiration. The dullards of fantasy have merely rehashed and reshuffled the old tropes back and forth, imagining that they are creating something.One cannot entirely blame Tolkien because Jordan, Martin, Goodkind, Paolini, Brooks, and Salvatore have created a genre out of his work which is unoriginal, cloying, escapist, and sexually unpalatable (if often successful). At least when Tolkien is dull, ponderous, and divergent, he is still achieving something.These authors are mostly trying to fix a Tolkien they don't understand, trying to make him easy to swallow. The uncomfortable sexuality is an attempt to repair the fact that Tolkien wrote a romance where the two lovers are thousands of miles apart for most of the story. Even a libertine like me appreciates Tolkien's chaste, distant, longing romance more than the obsessively fetishistic consummation that has come to define sexuality in the most repressive and escapist genre this side of four-color comic books.I don't think Tolkien is a great writer, I don't even think he is one of the greater fantasy writers. He was a stodgy old Tory, and the Shire is his false golden age of 'Merrie Olde England'. His romance wasn't romantic, and his dualistic moralizing cheapened the story. His attempt to force Christian theology onto a heroic epic is as problematic and conflicted as monks' additions to Beowulf. Tolkien's flaws have been well-documented by notable authors, from Moorcock's 'Epic Pooh' to Mieville's adroit analysis, but for all that, he was no slouch. Even if we lament its stolid lack of imagination, The Lord of the Rings is the work of a careful and deliberate scholar of language, style, and culture. It is the result of a lifetime of collecting and applying knowledge, which is a feat to behold. Each time the moon is mentioned, it is in the proper phase as calculated from the previous instance. Calendar dates and distances are calculated. Every name mentioned has a meaning and a past. I have even heard that each description of a plant or stone was carefully researched to represent the progression of terrain, though I can find no support for this theory.Yet what good is that to a story? It may be impressive as a thought exercise, but to put that much time and work into the details instead of fixing and streamlining the frame of the story itself seems entirely backwards to me. But for all that The Lord of the Rings may be dull, affected, and moralistic, it is Tolkien's, through and through.My Fantasy Book Suggestions", "'The Hobbit''In a hole in the ground there a lived hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.'I have seen 'The Hobbit' trilogy. After watched those movies, I find out that 'The Hobbit' book and 'The Hobbit' movies storylines are differences. I had a long considered whether I should buy 'The Hobbit' book. On 24th July 2016, I bought 'The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings box-set' Alhamdulillah.I like 'The Hobbit' trilogy but I think 'The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies' is best out of all. I prefer 'The Hobbit' book than movie trilogy.Those characters in the book are stupendous!I love this book so much Alhamdulillah. 'The Hobbit' is one of my favourite books. Alhamdulillah.'The Fellowship of the Ring''One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.'I have seen 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. I love those movies Alhamdulillah. I think 'The Two Towers' is the best movie series.I find language structure and literature intrigued. it is very unusual style.I thought the second half was a lot better than the first half.'The Two Towers'I thought 'The Two Towers' was a lot better than 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.I enjoy this book from the start to the end. Alhamdulillah.'The Return of King'I love the conclusion of 'The Lord of the Rings'. I thought 'The Return of the King' book is the best book in the 'The Lord of the Rings'. This book is very emotional and I cry a lot when I reach the end of the book. I thought 'The Lord of the Rings' is a lot better than 'The Hobbit'.Alhamdulillah I love 'The Return of the King'.", "It might be a classic, but there are many who have stern reservations about reading this series, partially I suspect due to its length... Well my answer to this is simply: DON'T BE LAZY!My journey within Middle Earth stated as young teenager - my parents gave me 'The Hobbit' as a Christmas present one year and my father and I decided we'd enjoy it together. I think it was the last book he ever read me as a 'bedtime story', but we embarked on the adventures of Bilbo Baggins together and absolutely loved every minute of it! The Hobbit was a stunning example of fantasy and adventure writing at its best. One event after another, crisis after epic excitement, wonder at the enormity of the main character's daring and courage.I am only sorry it took me so long to pursue the ongoing tale of the hobbits at Bagend. The Lord of the Rings was definitely a further step up the scale though. I will not deny that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a difficult read in terms of perseverance (hence 4 stars). I have always been an avid reader and there were a couple of times as I went through my teens that I picked up the Fellowship of the Ring and gave up before I could really get my teeth into it. Indeed, I didn't finish the trilogy until I was in my early 20s and I'm not ashamed to admit that I was actually quite proud of myself for having finally completed this mammoth journey with Frodo and his companions. I read about 2/3rds of the trilogy in one block in the end as I decided to forbid myself to watch the epic films again until I was done with the books because I knew that every time I grew impatient for the story to continue without wanting to spend the time or the energy reading it, I'd watch the films and that would result in me not feeling the need to continue the book for a good while. I say all this to illustrate a point - don't give up! It's totally worth it!The Lord of the Rings is filled with new troubles and adventures. At first the idea of following several characters quite separately may be quite unusual, even a little daunting. But it truly brings the world of Middle Earth to life! You get a true feel for the scale and even the politics of such a creation by journeying through it with different companions, each with a different purpose. The struggles and hardships are of such importance and value to both the reader and the characters by the end of the journey, Tolkien has spoken volumes about friendship, love, bravery, honour, loyalty, deceit...you name it, its all there.These books are a must read, wherever you are in your lifetime.", "I first read The Hobbit at the ripe old age of 12, and remember having to really concentrate to finish it. (I was probably still emerging from a really heavy Judy Blume phase at the time.) Even then I already had a true sense of loyalty of Tolkien, thanks to that great animated cartoon I watched as a little kid. When I later read the trilogy in high school, it was far easier to immerse myself in Tolkien's writing. Though I love all of the books, by far my favorite is The Two Towers. I think it shows the most interesting character development (especially in Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum) and Tolkien's tactic of writing two separate storylines in one book is always exciting. Just when you finish one storyline and are left jonesing for the next installment, you realize there is an entire other half to the story you forgot about. Everyone knows the dramatic impact Tolkien's writing has had on modern literature (can you say Harry Potter?) but no one does it better.", "My third time to read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I read all the poetry and verse this time. I loved these books. They are so different from the typical fiction of this genre. These were so well written, so well thought through. I love how they teach loyalty, fidelity, duty, and love of things more than self. They connect back to the greatness of the past. One other thing, we see that evil gets nervous also and that it will eventually collapse in on itself. In many pieces that show good and evil, good win almost by luck and by \"tricking\" evil in some way. Good will always win as long as there are good men and women willing to give of self for the better good.", "It's a genuinely good series. Very inventive and original. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was so god damn boring. Descriptions were tedious, fight scenes were tedious. I couldn't wrap my head around the story in general. Sometimes I skimmed whole paragraphs and pages and understood everything that was happening just fine! Honestly, I'm still wondering where the hell I got the patience to sit down and read the whole thing. Especially with so few female characters (thank god for Eowyn). I recommend it for people who like fantasy and don't mind unnecessary content.", "If my life would be writen between the pages of a book; I wish it be the Lord of the ring.

OMG WHAT IS THIS BOOK? WHAT IS THIS MESS I'M IN?? Excuse me, but that large salty lake where my life used to be is my tears. Yes, yes, this means I loved it. But SERIOUSLY. Nooooot okay. At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:\u2022 Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.\u2022 Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.\u2022 I also adore how sensible Ginny is. \u2022 Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.\u2022 I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. \u2022 Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.\u2022 Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. \u2022 I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. <3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. \u2022 ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)\u2022 Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. \u2022 Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...\u2022 How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the \"reason\" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. \u2022 I HOPE SNAPE DIES.\u2022 DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????\u2022 Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.\u2022 Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. \u2022 HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.\u2022 Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.\u2022 So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there.\u2022 I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of \"prefect\". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the \"She completes him by sorting him out\" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. \u2022 Not shipping that. ^^\u2022 Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years.", "i dont want to talk to anyonedont even look at mei was expecting it and i still cried for like 30 minutes", "** spoiler alert **\n           I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children\u2019s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death.With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?", "Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless.

He's so secretive, and he's always sneaking around, not explaining anything to Harry.-I'm always so proud of Fred and George for getting their own joke shop... I don't know what it is, I just feel like a proud mom.-ALL OF THE TOM RIDDLE BACKSTORY. THE GAUNT HOUSE. OMG. I literally need a whole book about Tom Riddle's life. That would make me happy.-While reading this book, there were about a hundred times when I was just amazed by irony at the whole Snape/Half-Blood Prince situation. (Harry is always going on about how great the Prince is and how terrible Snape is, etc.) I loved it!-\"Tom used to collect trophies,\" said Dumbledore, \"This will be important later.\" WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HORCRUXES TO HARRY THEN? COME ON MANNNNN.-the fact that Voldemort went back to Hogwarts to ask for a job just.... is hilarious to me. I'm picturing a sort of weird looking Tom Riddle like \"plz. im evil but i luv hogwartz\"-when you find out that the Defence Against the Dark Arts job is actually cursed *thumbs up*-\"I love you, Hermione.\" RON ACTUALLY SAID THOSE WORDS. HE SAID THEM AND MY HEART SANG. He meant it in a friendly way but Hermione definitely loved hearing it.-Harry and Ginny are both so sassy and I love it when they become sassy together <3-at the end when Hagrid said something along the lines of \"Dumbledore will be able to fix it\" right after Harry saw him die.... Saddest thing ever.This book and its movie are definitely up there on my favorites list.", "It seems like by now, everyone would realize they should listen to Harry..Such a sad end :( I knew that was going to happen before starting the series, but didn't know when. It still got me in the feels, though.The book as a whole was really fun and entertaining. I love the mystery and learning more about Voldemort.

She lives with the Weasleys, where, honestly, no one makes it easy for her. Molly is fighting a constant battle with her but Fleur doesn't back off. Everyone is convinced she is vain and arrogant, but it's that moment in the hospital wing where - finally - these two amazing women recognise each other as equals, where Fleur gains acceptance and much more than that: respect. Everyone expected her to leave Bill for selfish reasons, no one expected that she really, truly loves him. But by proving that she would stand by him, whatever might happen - and everyone knew bad things were going to happen - she opened Molly's eyes and Molly saw her, for the first time, for what she really was.

He's come to tell you - well, I'll let him do it.\"There are some scenes however, that I do not like to read, where I have to stop myself from skipping them. Firstly, the dreadful second Quidditch match, secondly the Sectumsempra scene with Malfoy and Snape, thirdly Dumbledore suffering in the Cave. They are not very enjoyable.Something that will forever annoy me is how absolutely no one believes Harry's Malfoy-is-a-Death-Eater theory. He keeps telling Ron and Hermione about it but they ignore him.And then again, do you really expect me to believe that the brightest witch of her age would only get and \"Exceeds Expectations\" on her Defence Against The Dark Arts O.W.L.?

So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends:https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It\u2019s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ll just come out and say it: I\u2019m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He\u2019s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I\u2019m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can\u2019t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I\u2019m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don\u2019t like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He\u2019s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents\u2019 legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he\u2019s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn\u2019t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn\u2019t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book.Also, I\u2019ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He\u2019s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn\u2019t last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing she\u2019s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she\u2019s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone\u2019s favorite character? He\u2019s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I\u2019m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU\u2019RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters\u2019 downfalls: I\u2019m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don\u2019t count. Harry and Hermione\u2019s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that\u2019s who I am, and she\u2019s annoying in this book. AND IT\u2019S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he\u2019s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren\u2019t here nearly enough. The price of Harry\u2019s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I\u2019M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I\u2019d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it\u2019s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It\u2019s such a gorgeous setting and I\u2019m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I\u2019ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I\u2019m really going to miss this series. I\u2019ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it\u2019s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I\u2019m rereading it after 10 years, it\u2019s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else\u2019s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!", "Buddyread with the cutest Trixi.*sniffs* I have actually finished this several days ago but I spent those days mourning for the loss of one of my favorite characters of all time and before I start bawling my heart and eyes out again, let me straight away proceed to the random thoughts while and after reading the book. *sniffs* 1. *Gasps* Professor Snape???2. Harry\u2019s Quidditch Captain! Yaaas!3. Weasleys\u2019 Wizzard Wheezes (Say this ten times)4. Malfoy\u2019s head on Pansy Parkinson\u2019s lap and Pansy stroking his head. *shudders*5. Slughorn\u2019s belly preceded him out of the door. Bahaha6. Potions class has never been this cheerful. Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better. Thanks to cheating. Lol.7. Ron, you bollocks! Stop being an idiot, WonWon!8. Voldemort as a student seems to me even more sinister than the Dark Lord he already is. *shivers*9. Like Harry, I am Dumbledore\u2019s man through and through. Take that, Rufus!10. I\u2019d go back to school anytime if it meant having Professor Dumbledore as a teacher. 11. Aherm! Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry?12. There\u2019s a reason a Dark Arts teacher stays only for a year. It\u2019s all clear now.13. Who would have thought that the once timid Ginny will blossom into a confident, beautiful, charming, funny and best of all, snarky girl?14. Chapter 24 will particularly make you swoon! Gaaah! (view spoiler)[ I ship Harry and Ginny! <3  (hide spoiler)]15. RIP, Aragog.16. For the first time, I solved the mystery! (view spoiler)[ I have guessed early on in the story that the Half Blood Prince was Snape! Yaaas! (hide spoiler)]17. I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore. I can\u2019t\u2026*sobs* Some of the things/characters missing in the movie: 1. Kreacher and Dobby2. Bill and Fleur3. Dumbledore\u2019s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters.4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that\u2019ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs*  \u201cIn fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\u201d  \u201cPeople find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\u201d  \u201cIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\u201d  \u201cWords are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\"  \u201cThe pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\u201d  \u201cTo the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not really goodbye after all.\u201d On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today! Enjoy! <3", "** spoiler alert **\n           Edit : Rounded it up into 5 stars!REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW!4,8 Stars \n'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,' said Hermione. 'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.' \nI'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over.*takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u309c\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\u2606\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u309c\u2605\u30fb\u3002\u30fb\u3002\nPHLEGM\n I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD\nRon and Hermione\nI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.I remember very clearly that I cried so much till my eyes were red and puffy and that time I kept saying that I hated him and I didn't care about him but saying that seemed useless because I kept crying and crying. That time I wanted to hurt Ron's heart too, I wanted him to feel the exact pain Hermione felt when she saw him kissing Lavender. 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. \nHarry And Ginny\nhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... \nDumbledore's death\nI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!"], "Notes from a Small Island": ["This book combines several of my favorite things: travelogues, England, and the charm of Bill Bryson.It is the book version of comfort food.So you can understand why I instinctively reached for this audiobook on the the first day of my new job. I wanted something comforting. And humorous. And British.I was instantly gratified. Bryson begins his book about touring England by describing how intensely Brits will argue about distance and driving routes:\"If you mention in the pub that you intend to drive from, say, Surrey to Cornwall, a distance that most Americans would happily go to get a taco, your companions will puff their cheeks, look knowingly at each other, and blow out air as if to say, 'Well, now, that's a bit of a tall order,' and then they'll launch into a lively and protracted discussion of whether it's better to take the A30 to Stockbridge and then the A303 to Ilchester, or the A361 to Glastonbury via Shepton Mallet. Within minutes the conversation will plunge off into a level of detail that leaves you, as a foreigner, swiveling your head in quiet wonderment ... Give two or more men in a pub the names of any two places in Britain and they can happily fill hours. Wherever it is you want to go, the consensus is generally that it's just about possible as long as you scrupulously avoid Okehampton, the North Circular in London, and the Severn Bridge westbound between the hours of 3 p.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. on Monday, except bank holidays when you shouldn't go anywhere at all.\"The whole book was immensely enjoyable. The plan was for Bryson to take a last tour of England before he and his family moved to America for a few years. (Bryson is from the States, but his wife is British.) He was going to travel mostly by public transportation, because his wife wouldn't let him have the car. (HA!) There did not seem to be a logic to his journey -- instead he went hither and thither as he desired, sometimes jumping on a bus or train if it happened to arrive while he was standing there. A few times he broke down and rented a car or took a cab, but he always gave a good reason.As someone who has not visited England in more than 15 years* (and what a sad realization it was to do the math), I could only relate to a few stops on his journey. But I still loved his meanderings and his musings. And I will continue to find more Bill Bryson audiobooks because they are just so delightful.Update July 2016*This was a delightful re-read! I had the good fortune to visit England earlier this summer \u2014 so it's no longer been 15 years since I've been there \u2014 and decided to listen to Bryson's audiobook again. It was great to have a better understanding of where he visited, and to enjoy his amusing stories. When I have some time I'll add more to the Favorite Quotes section, because there are lots of fun ones. Highly recommended to fans of travelogues and/or England.First Read: August 2014Second Read: July 2016Favorite Quotes\"I can never understand why Londoners fail to see that they live in the most wonderful city in the world. It is, if you ask me, far more beautiful and interesting than Paris and more lively than anywhere but New York -- and even New York can't touch it in lots of important ways. It has more history, finer parks, a livelier and more varied press, better theaters, more numerous orchestras and museums, leafier squares, safer streets, and more courteous inhabitants than any other large city in the world.\"\"I spent two days driving through the Cotswolds and didn't like it at all -- not because the Cotswolds were unlovely but because the car was. You are so sealed off from the world in a moving vehicle, and the pace is all wrong. I had grown used to moving about at walking speed or at least British Rail speed, which is often of course much the same thing.\"\"I have a small, tattered clipping that I sometimes carry with me and pull out for purposes of private amusement. It's a weather forecast from the Western Daily Mail and it says, in toto, 'Outlook: Dry and warm, but cooler and with some rain.' There you have in a single pithy sentence the English weather captured to perfection: dry but rainy with some warm/cool spells. The Western Daily Mail could run that forecast every day -- for all I know, it may -- and scarcely ever be wrong.\"", "Bill Bryson likes hedgerows, yelling at people, the English language, complaining, pretending to be a hiker, the fifth Duke of Portland, W.J.C. Scott-Bentinck, and himself. He tries too hard to be clever, and although you're being introduced to some interesting mental pictures (\"a mid-face snack dispenser\" for instance), and it's positively obvious how much he loves the English language and the art of writing, the lengths to which he goes can be tiring. The long-winded, irritating tangents he goes on add to this eye-clawing frustration. He seems to be bipolar, or maybe hypoglycemic, for his like or dislike of a certain village or city appears to be related to how much he's eaten or how much sleep he's had. (And please answer, who goes to see the best of England in the winter?) He is rude to a McDonald's cashier and the owner of a guest house, which I simply cannot tolerate. I have a soft spot for the Scots, and the way Bryson pokes fun at the gentlemen in a local pub is unfathomable. On top of everything else, there is very little mention of my home for 6 months, Norwich, and the closest he seems to get is a switch at Newmarket. Still, I didn't completely hate this book, and it had me laughing out loud at some points because he hit it dead on. Interesting about the hedgerows and the former Duke of Portland, too. Mustn't grumble, or so they say.", "Newsflash: I have a new entry into my Top Ten Authors (past and present) that I would like to invite to a night out at the pub for a session of heavy drinking and tall tales. Bill Bryson, with his sly humour and irreverent atitude towards tourism, is a strong contender for the top position right after my first experience of travelling in his company through the twisted back lanes of historical hamlets of his cherished island. Being both a personal journal and a travel guide, his Notes have been voted as the book that best represent Britain to the world. I believe the praise is well deserved.The secret of Bill Bryson success is easy to discern from the pages of this journal: He fell in love with the island from the first moment he landed in Dover in 1973, and his enthusiasm is as fresh and as catching two decades later as he prepares for a farewell trip before returning to America. Everything that lay before me was new and mysterious and exciting in a way you can't imagine. England was full of words I'd never heard before - streaky bacon, short back and sides, Belisha bacon, serviettes, high tea, ice-cream cornet. [...] I spent a long day wandering aimlessly and happily along residential streets and shopping streets, eavesdropping on conversations at bus-stops and street corners, looking with interest in the windows of greengrocers and butchers and fishmongers, reading fly-posters and planning applications, quietly absorbing. Sometimes it takes a long trip away from home or the perspective of a stranger to make you realize the beauty of the land and of the people around you, and Bill Bryson is for me the best kind of guide possible. He shares my love for walking, an impulsive nature that can change routes on the spur of a moment, and equal interest in the highbrow amusements of historical monuments or art galleries and the popular amusement parks and drinking pubs, for the statistical trivia and for the scandalous bit of gossip about the local worthies. There is something awfully exhilarating about riding on the top of a double-decker. You can see into upstair windows and peer down on the tops of people's heads at bus-stops (and when they come up the stairs a moment later you can look at them with a knowing look that says: 'I've just seen the top of your head') and there's the frisson of excitement that comes with careering round a corner or roundabout on the brink of catastrophe. You get an entirely fresh perspective on the world. Time and time again the words that describe the places, the people, the cuisine and the culture of Britain turn into a song of joy at the chance to witness the marvels of his adopted country. Not even the constant bad weather (roughly about two thirds of his out of season journey by my count) can keep his buoyant mood down for more than one evening. Inevitably, the next stop on the railway line or the next hill to be climbed will bring back the cheerful hiker who likes to remind the reader to count his blessings and be happy to be alive, to be healthy and to live in a peaceful period of history that makes lonely travelling an attractive proposition. Beyond the headland, the path climbed steeply to Ballard Down, a taxing slog for an old puffed-out flubba-wubba like me, but worth it for the view, which was sensational - like being on top of the world. For seven weeks in 1994, Bill Bryson will try to rediscover Britain from the southern Downs to the last desolate northern moors, travelling alone on foot or by public transport, a decision that I will let him explain with his usual mix of militancy and self-deprecating humour: Motorized vehicles are ugly and dirty and they bring out the worst in people. They clutter every kerbside, turn ancient market squares into disorderly jumbles of metal, spawn petrol stations, second-hand car lots, Kwik-Fit centres and other dispiriting blights. They are horrible and awful and I wanted nothing to do with them on this trip. And besides, my wife wouldn't let me have the car. With great enthusiasm comes also great indignation at the carelessness and disrespect for the heritage of Britain, as witnessesd in the ugliness of modern cement office blocks, proliferation of cars and highways, loss of diversity and globalization, mass tourism and the trivialization of history. In a way, Notes from a Small Island is also a snapshot of a world in danger of being swallowed up and zombified into a characterless, generic shopping mall. It gets me a little wild sometimes. You have in this country the most comely, the most parklike, the most flawlessly composed countryside the world has ever known, a product of centuries of tireless, instinctive improvement, and you are half a generation from destroying most of it for ever. and, What made Weston feel familiar was, of course, that it was just like everywhere else. It had Boots and Marks&Spencer and Dixons and W. H. Smith and all the rest of it. I realized with a kind of dull ache that there wasn't a single thing here that I hadn't seen a million times already. and, ... it was wonderful to be in a great ecclesiastical structure so little disturbed by shuffling troops of tourists. When you consider the hordes that flock to Salisbury, York, Canterbury, Bath and so many other great churches of England, Lincoln's relative obscurity is something of a small miracle. Speaking of shopping malls, did you ever go shopping with you better half? If so, you will know what the author is talking about: Shopping is not, in my view, something that men and women should do together since all men want to do is buy something noisy like a drill and get it home so they can play with it, whereas women aren't happy until they've seen more or less everything in town and felt at least 1500 different textures. I have a small suspicion that Mr. Bryson had more on his mind than the perils of shopping with his wife when he decided to travel alone through the island. How else can one explain the detailed descriptions of going every night to the pub and sampling the best the Island has to offer in terms of draughts and dark ales and strong spirits? After all, a serious tourist guide must study and include details about the nightlife attractions of the places he visits . Case in point: on his very first day in Britain in 1973, our young author decided to go watch an R-rated movie called \"Suburban Wife Swap\" in order to improve his language skills and his knowledge of local customs. Which is another reason to trust his judgement on worthy travel spots :-) Now the second rule of excessive drinking (the first, of course, is don't take a sudden shine to a woman larger than Hoss Cartwright) is never to drink in a place on a steep slope. I thought about mentioning some of the places described in the Notes, and what makes them memorable, but there are too many tempting propositions and Bill Bryson does a much better job than me in selling their charms to the readership. I confess I have never visited England, and if anybody asks me what is my favorite holiday destination I will still answer without hesitation : Paris! Even after 15+ visits, it is still my first choice for a visit. But Bill Bryson's small island is making a compelling case for a revision of my priorities. If I were hard pressed to choose only one of the hundreds of interesting places mentioned in the guide, I think I would settle for Liverpool. It might not be obvious why, at first or second glance, what Liverpool offers more than the Lake District or the Cotswolds, but I grew up with the tales of Jules Verne and Joseph Conrad, and more recently Douglass Reeman and Patrick O'Brian, and I always dreamed that one day I will embark for a voyage around the world's blue lanes: Once there was infinite romance in the sea, and the Merseyside Maritime Museum captures every bit of it. [...] J. B. Priestley called them the greatest constructions of the modern world, our equivalent of cathedrals, and he was absolutely right. I was appalled to think that never in my life would I have an opportunity to stride down a gangplank in a panama hat and a white suit and go looking for a bar with a revolving ceiling fan. How crushingly unfair life can sometimes be. The rest of my review is a series of footnotes and little details that reinforce the good impression and the fun I had on my travels with this incredible guide. Do you know what the most important quality of a tourist is? Curiosity: Why do they call it a grapefruit? Why do the British call them jumpers? Why do they call them milk floats? They don't float at all. Why do we foot a bill rather than, say, head it? Why do we say that our nose is running? (Mine slides). Who ate the first oyster and how on earth did anyone ever figure out that ambergris would make an excellent fixative for perfumes? Do you know how to prepare for your trip? Read as much as you can about the places you are going to see (and write about): I spent a little time watching the scenery, then pulled out my copy of Kingdom by the Sea to see if Paul Theroux had said anything about the vicinity that I might steal or modify to my own purposes. what sort of equipment you need for your trip? The fun begins well in advance of the actual departure: I can spend hours looking at rucksacks, kneesocks, compasses and survival rations, then go to another shop and look at precisely the same things all over again.  (I wonder what his wife thought about men and their shopping habits now?)Are you worried the locals and the other tourists will laugh at you? It's better to be ready for anything than wet and cold, so relax, and enjoy the view: I remember when I first came to Britain wandering into a bookstore and being surprised to find a whole section dedicated to 'Walking Guides'. This struck me as faintly bizarre and comical - where I came from people did not as a rule require written instructions to achieve locomotion - but then gradually I learned that there are, in fact, two kinds of walking in Britain, namely the everyday kind that gets you to the pub and, all being well, back home again, and the more earnest type that involves stout boots, Ordnance Survey maps in plastic pouches, rucksacks with sandwiches and flasks of tea, and, in its terminal phase, the wearing of khaki shorts in inappropriate weather. Is it worth your time and effort? And then, just as I was about to lie down and call for a stretcher, we crested a final rise and found ourselves abruptly, magically, on top of the earth, on a platform in the sky, amid an ocean of swelling summits.

The good news is that Bill Bryson has already written a sequel   The Road to Little Dribbling   and that I have already ordered two more of his other books - the one on hiking through the Appallachians, and the one on popular science. I must thank all my friends here on Goodreads who recommended this author to me.

James CrumleyIt's a work in progress.", "After 20 years in England, Bill Bryson decided to tour Britain in 1995 by public transport over ~6 weeks and write a book about it.HUMOURThere are snippets of great humour and insight (\u201ca young man with more on his mind than in it\u201d; \u201ccarpet with the sort of pattern you get when you rub your eyes too hard\u201d; in Liverpool, \u201cThey were having a festival of litter... citizens had taken time off from their busy schedules to add crisp packets, empty cigarette boxes and carrier bags to the otherwise bland and neglected landscape\u201d, and an amusing anecdote of him asking for directions having forgotten he was wearing pants on his head). But as the book progresses, they become fewer as the amount of repetitious moaning increases. For a self-confessed Anglophile, he often seems to dislike the place, though the weather gets off surprisingly lightly, especially given that he made the trip in late autumn.BRYSON HERUMPHINGThe lack of trains in remote areas is a particular bugbear, but what I don't understand is his outraged surprise - he'd lived in and travelled around the country for 20 years! He argues that they shouldn\u2019t have to be profitable because traffic lights, drains and parks don\u2019t. And at a practical level, he often changes his mind about where he's going once he's on the station platform or even on the train itself (i.e. after he should have bought a ticket), yet he never mentions encountering any problems with ticket collectors etc. Modern architecture and urban planning are his other pet hates. He bemoans the homogeneity of high streets full of chains (rather than family shops), yet is annoyed at the lack of 24 hour opening and gives Marks and Spencer so many favourable mentions, I wondered if they sponsored him in some way.ME HERUMPHINGReaders are treated to endless descriptions of hotels and stations, but without enough comment about actual people (with a few notable exceptions: Mrs Smegma, a lunatic in Weston, and an ancient train buff), which makes it increasingly dull. Mind you, the way he chose his wife is described in very detached terms, so maybe he\u2019s just not really a people person. On the other hand, he occasionally throws in gratuitous expletives, which don\u2019t fit the general style of the book.However, the worst offence is the lack of index or map \u2013 both of which should be essential in any travel book (an index for any non fiction book). Overseas readers might also appreciate a glossary, as it's clearly written for an audience who, if not English, are at least familiar with the country.THE GOOD BITSBut there are plus sides, and Bryson is at his best when he goes off at a tangent and riffs on some unexpected topic. He explains why the British would have coped well under Communism (good at queuing, tolerant of dictatorships (cf Mrs Thatcher) and boring food). He throws in potted history about the founder of Sainsbury and his mansion (but doesn\u2019t bother to find out why it was left to rot) and the fact that the bicycle pedal was invented in Scotland. He points out that Manchester has no motif (that\u2019s why I find it so forgettable!), the US has no equivalent of \u201ctaking the piss\u201d and that while US soaps are about glamorous people who can\u2019t act, British ones are the opposite. Rather than extolling the innovation of the tube map, he suggest tricks to play on tourists e.g. by getting the tube from Bank to Mansion House (1 change, 6 stops) to end up 200 yards from where they started. Best of all, he delights in words: the odd and romantic place names, the differences in usage between the US and Britain and the florid language of menus. He ponders replying in kind and requesting \u201ca lustre of water freshly drawn from the house tap and presented au nature in a cylinder of glass\u201d!CURATEOverall, it\u2019s like the famous curate\u2019s egg: \u201cparts of it are excellent\u201d. I think there's a good book struggling to get out, but it needed a decent editor to make that happen.", "It took me forever to read this because I was constantly picking it up and putting it down, not because I wasn\u2019t enjoying it, but because it\u2019s one of those books where it works to read it in this way, and I read so many other books during the times I took breaks from reading this book.Sometimes I just don\u2019t like Bill Bryson as a man. There\u2019s a smattering of things he writes that are cruel, crass, and otherwise makes him unappealing to me, and he sure drinks a lot of beer, but the nasty material is a tiny minority of the book\u2019s content. He\u2019s basically a likeable and interesting guy who is an explorer, much of it done via walking, and he has a refreshing sense of what constitutes adventure.He\u2019s a skilled writer. He\u2019s very, very funny; I laughed out loud and chuckled many times.I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Britain so for me this was a bit of armchair traveling. Unfortunately, much of this book made me wish I\u2019d visited the place (and most other places) at least a few decades ago. Bryson makes clear the homogenization that\u2019s taken place at various British locales, and this book was written 15 years ago so who knows what he\u2019d say now. I\u2019d still love to go but I\u2019d skip some of his destinations. He also writes much about the history of his destinations and I found most of the information fascinating.One thing that tickled my funny bone is that when he was in one small English town, he saw the old \u201cThis is Cinerama\u201d movie, a movie I remember from my childhood, and brought me right back to the United States of America. I hadn\u2019t realized the movie was already old the first time that I saw it, but I do remember loving that film and other Cinerama movies.There\u2019s a glossary of English (vs. American English) words in the back of the book. Given that I\u2019m a bit of an Anglophile, I already knew the definition of most of the words, but having it in the book was a fun touch.", "\"One thing I have learned over the years is that your impressions of a place are necessarily, and often unshakably, colored by the route you take into it.\"- Bill Bryson, Notes from a Small Island It is really hard not to like Bill Bryson's travel books. Actually, it is hard not to like his dictionaries, travelogues, or explorations of: the Universe, the home, Shakespeare, etc. He is, essentially, our Falstaff. He stumbles from bus to train, from pub to pub, from city to city exploring Britain one last time before he and his family leaves. Bryson's insights and digressions are always amusing. I believe this book sits in time (and in form almost) next to one of his other great travel books A Walk in the Woods. They share a similar Brysonesque tone and lightness. Again, I would bring back my Falstaff comparisons. Bryson uses humor, self-mockery, and a slight sneer to convey information and truth. One of the \"truths\" that Bryson pushed heavily in this constructed memoir (there has to be a better term for writing about an event that is designed to be written about). He is pissed that the Brits don't take better care of their heritage. They spend little money on their parks, seem to let their beautiful architecture get torn down, and seem apathetic to hedge rows. Bryson would argue that the Brits are almost blind to their own beauty. They are too close. Sometimes it takes a stranger (and a fool) to whisper the truths you KNOW are true, but are just to close to see.", "Ambling know-it-all wanders around the UK, complaining about architecture, getting drunk, finding delight in little, and generally having a hard time deciding where to eat (always Indian or Chinese in the end). It paints a pretty depressing picture of the UK, when I think his intention was the opposite. Plus, I really liked his book about traveling through continental Europe, so I don\u2019t know what happened here. Also thought the scene where he tells us how fat people eat was insulting, to, well, fat people. He also takes a few cracks at the elderly because he says they like to complain\u2014but pot, kettle, black. He really comes across as a curmudgeon in this one, but I kept reading because at least I was learning a little bit about Britain. (A very little bit.) I wanted to smack him after he refuses to pay 14.50 for a hotel breakfast, then can\u2019t find anywhere in town to eat, then starving, staggers into a McDonald\u2019s and proceeds to go off on a poor minimum-wage employee when he asks if he\u2019d like to add an apple turnover to his order. It's McDonald's, Bill. That's what they do.", "I wasn't sure how much I'd get out of reading a book about my home country written by an American... but it turned out to be a joy. I hadn't realised, until I read the book, that Bryson had lived in the UK for many years. It gives him a rather unusual perspective on the place and makes for interesting reading.It also helps that I enjoyed his sense of humour. It's a little morbid at times; he makes a joke about the Zeebrugge ferry disaster at one point that a lot of people may find to be in bad taste; but I'm not easily offended, so it didn't worry me too much. I laughed quite a bit while reading this book and, as I read about half of it out walking myself, that lifted my spirits and helped me stay the course. (I'm desperately trying to shift some of this excess weight I've been carrying around for years, so I'm trying to do a 90 minute walk every day. It seems to be working; I've lost about 28 lbs so far...)On occasion, he portrays himself in a less than sympathetic light, being downright rude to various customer service folks across the country who were only doing their jobs as the company they're working for asks them to do it. Here's a tip for folks out there: if you have received bad service from a customer service employee, please feel free to complain. If you have a problem with a company policy that the employee has absolutely no control over, ask to speak to their manager; don't be a complete fucking arsehole to the poor bloke/lass who is only doing their job. If you do that, it's YOU being a shitty human being, not them.To Bryson's credit, he usually realises he's being a dickhead on these occasions; usually when it's too late to do anything about it.Anyway, it was a real pleasure to see the UK through Bryson's eyes for a while. It almost had me feeling patriotic for a second... but then I slapped myself in the face and started thinking like an intelligent human being again. I'll definitely be reading more of Bryson's work in the future.", "Mr Bryson has an entertaining line of patter, a nice, wry humour and he works very very hard to endear himself with the reader. Look, I'm a regular guy from Iowa who sometimes gets really narked at owners of undisciplined dogs and thinks hedgerows are A Good Thing and cars aren't. But that doesn't quite compensate for the fact that this is basically a catalogue of towns, hotel rooms and meals in restaurants - an amusing catalogue, but a catalogue all the same. Where BB gets right up my nose is with his quaint idea that Britain should have remained in a seventies time warp, preserving all those quirky little British things like red pillar boxes and old-fashioned red telephone boxes merely, it would seem, because they appeal to regular guys from Iowa. Has it escaped his notice that even British people now have mobiles, and no longer need to use smelly phone booths and, oh wonder, now write e-mails or post updates on social networks, which renders pillar boxes surplus to requirements, no matter what colour they are? And I got heartily sick of his rants about modern town architecture, he sounds like Prince Charles with a less annoying accent. I'm sure that Britain is not always a model of sensitive town planning, but what does he expect? Filling station forecourts with mock-Georgian carriage gates? Boots the chemist with all its products in brass-handled mahogany drawers? Ask those Thurso ladies he met taking the six am train for the four hour trip to Inverness to buy knickers and get their hair done. I bet they'd rather have a bland, glass fronted Marks and Spencer in Thurso, even if it did spoil the appearance of their lovely little self-sufficient community.", "I happened upon this book by chance and read it because I enjoy Bill Bryson's writing style. His witty observations are not absent from this travelogue from his adopted home of the UK. The funny text and clever wording, however, do little to mask the fact that Bryson does not actually do very much on his journey. In almost every town, he takes walks, goes out to eat, gets quietly drunk, and bemoans modern architecture - in that order. Style can cover up for substance for only so long before it gets boring.Despite the lack of genuine action, Bryson does put the country in a new light and features some observational gems that any long-term traveler can relate to.Don't pick this book if you're looking for a good introduction to Bill Bryon's writing style. Pick up a copy of Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe instead.(American readers unfamiliar with the UK will have a hard time understanding some jokes and references; but, that won't detract very much from the overall effect.)"], "The Changeling": ["Wonderful storytelling. Intriguing place in history. I don't finish books that don't pull me in. Or rather when the storytelling falters, i skip to the end. I absolutely drooled over every word on every page of this novel. Horsely is an ambitious researcher with an active imagination that i want to peek in on regularly.", "Not to be confused with the novel connected to angelina jolies newest movie. The changling follows a girl who is brought up as a boy. Fearing loosing her child to the anger of her husband, she raises her daughter as a boy, fooling both child and father, by convincing them both she has very deformed genitals. Through shame the girl grows up the pride of her father, and the secret of her mother, only to be pushed finally in the direction of the church. Unfortunatly nature has it's own way of revealing her \"flaws,\" while she is in seminary to become a holy man. Story takes place during the black plague era, and thus gives you a historical reference to the disease, time period and seminary life, in the dark era.", "This book dragged on and on. Suffering. Misery. Plague. But I just never cared about the character enough to make it worth my while. What a disappointment.", "Uneven but worth the read. So how do we define ourselves? Is it what people tell us is true, what we learn is true, what we want to be true?", "This was the second time reading The Changeling of Finnistuath. The first time I read it was 9 years ago when it was first published. I remembered liking it, so thought I would re-read. I suppose that a more seasoned reading palate and some years of life experience have effected my response to this book.The story starts out well enough with a very interesting scenario, and set in a great time period. Sadly, I became less enchanted by the book this second time around. The narrative is very involved, it felt like it took forever to read. There are long passages that follow the thoughts and actions of several side characters, a midwife, lord's son etc. This was somewhat interesting, but seemed overdone and tiresome after a bit. SPOILERS TO FOLLOWThe worst part for me was as the story is nearing the end. Whereas time is rather crawling for the characters throughout the body of the book, towards the end years leap ahead in a few pages. Suddenly Grey is older, her son ages to sexual maturity and is quickly killed...I don't know, I just felt like this \"older\" personification of Grey didn't fit with the character I had been reading about through the majority of the book. Then the passages of her lengthy mourning and nomadic lifestyle vaguely described, I felt like the book kept going on and on when it could have ended chapters earlier with more satisfaction. This may be interesting for a one time read, but definitely not a keeper for me.", "** spoiler alert **\n           I wasnt sure if I would like this book at first. In the beginning, Grey is a boy. As a boy, he was protected from the world in ways that a girl would not have been. However, Grey turns out to be a girl and realizes the ways of the world are unjust for many, not just girls. This book takes you through Grey's life from boy, to woman, to a woman with a boy. When she finally identifies herself as a mother, she finds a contentment that she has been unable to obtain most of her life. When she is no longer a mother, not only does her heart break but the reader's heart breaks with the truth of the unfairness of the world in which we still live; a world in where a mother's grief exceeds all others.", "Another accidental find, this time in my local library. This is a very sad book. Just as I thought Grey's life had change for the better, disaster strikes. Still, it's written very well, almost poetic.  Gregory, who becomes known as Grey, is raised as a boy. Despite the onset of puberty she never realizes she is female, until one particular incident in her young life. This leads her on quite a journey, of which I will divulge nothing. No spoilers here!  The main characters all seem to be dealing with a crisis of faith, whether it be in their religion, the Pope, the fairies, or themselves. Despite her bizarre life, Grey seems to be the only one who has a grip on herself. Until the end, when her life once again changes.", "If you want a book to tear you wide open, this is certainly the one to do it. Horsley uses language that paints a vivid, dark, gorgeously hurtful picture of life in the fourteenth century. The character of Grey is one that will linger with me - her strength through unimaginable circumstance...it was just breathtaking.This book did not make me feel good. It did not affirm a belief in the general goodness of humanity. There was little hope, redemption, or graces but there was a strength - the strength of one woman - that inspired me in ways I don't even know how to articulate.This is an important book. It's about identity and perseverance. And, if nothing else, it bathes simple, ugly things, in a language that takes it from ordinary to extraordinary.", "Wow, this book shows how messed up life was during \"The Dark Ages.\" Grey is born a girl, but raised as a boy so her father will not kill her. He already has enough daughters to feed. She never doubts she is a boy until puberty, when she begins to think the changes in her body are a curse brought on by disobeying the priest to whom she is a servant \"boy.\" The corruption of the church and that part of her life where she wanted to become a monk was confusing and that part of the story I did not like. Overall, I liked about 2/3 of the book, so I can't say I didn't like it, but I can't say I'd recommend it.", "While I liked the concept and the plot of this novel, I think it would have greatly benefited by having the narrative be more closely tied with the protagonist. Grey, the protagonist, is such an interesting character, first being raised to believe she was a boy, then finding forbidden love, eventually becoming mother, wife, and warrior. I would have loved to have been more inside Grey's (what must have been) tumultuous mind. However, Horsley tends to write very distantly from her characters and you get the sense that you are observing the story from a great distance without ever really knowing the characters."], "Changeling (Changeling, #1)": ["This fantasy set in NYC is delightful. It's both scary and funny.", "This book was really good, so the parts of it which were frustrating were really more frustrating than they would have been in a mediocre book, sadly. Fantastic world-building and a smart, self-aware protagonist -- yay! But that protagonist couldn't manage a believable interaction with any of the other people in the book -- boo! Neef had pretty much no empathy for anyone, no sense that she should be concerned in anything but a mechanical how-does-this-affect-me way with other people's feelings. There could have been a great story in there about what emotions really meant for humans raised by fairies and fairies raised by humans, but the opportunity was lost. The author's short story Catnyp, about the same protagonist when she's a bit older, was much more appealing.", "Changeling is funny and fresh and fine, another in the short list of fabulous books set in New York City published in the past year. It is takes place in New York Between, and Sherman balances the Between of Faerie with a terrific young heroine named Neef, ringing changes on every single New York and Faerie trope you can imagine, and a few you can't.", "Altamente entretenido, me mantuvo enganchada a la historia de principio a fin, lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 fue la cantidad de mitolog\u00eda que manejaron. Lo \u00fanico que no me gust\u00f3 fue el final, que me dej\u00f3 con ganas de m\u00e1s.", "Great read! Fun little twist on fairy tales and magic lands.", "I absoulutley loved this book. It was fantasy so there were mermaids,demons and the main character boy was she a handful. so if your done with your book pick this one up i garuntee you will love it.", "smiles all around... this book was amazingly fun... kind of exactly what children's literature should be... plenty of amazing characters, lots of mythological beasties, and loads of funny dialogue... kinda perfect that the important characters were girls, and not all about their appearance and \"where are the cute boys??\"... just a joy to read...", "Changeling tells the story of Neef, a little girl who lives in New York Between. Neef, born a mortal, is a girl different from everyone else. Neef is curious, bold, but most of all, she is stubborn. Neef eventually was punished by the Green Lady and exiled from New York Between. On her journey, she is accompanied by her overly, sensitive, mortal friend Changeling. Neef and Changeling are on a journey to recover three things in order to get Neef accepted back into New York Between or the Hunt will continue to find her and will not rest until Neef is found and done for.", "** spoiler alert **\n           I am, personally, not very fond of urban fantasy as such, especially in this particular kind of setting. The stories of an Other City (in this case, New York), created in the likeness of the human one and populated by fairy versions of the actual inhabitants (here: artistic types in the Village, vampiric fairy entertainers in Broadway and gold-hungry dragons, the magical Bear-Bull and a woman named DowJones in the Wall Street, to name only a few) very, very rarely seem convincing to me, because they are too obvious, too predictable (which is why I loved Ben Aaronowitch's concept of making Mama Thames a black woman: he chose a less predictable and yet, in modern multicultural London, perfectly fitting personification for London's main river). To be completely fair, however: I do know the book and the concepts are designed... well, not exactly for me: I am neither young adult, not New Yorker in love with her strange city. It was not the setting, then, that made me like (really, seriously like) Delia Sherman's novel. What got me hooked and kept me reading was, firstly, the creation of characters, and secondly, the story as such. Sherman had a fantastic idea in creating her protagonists. The narrator is Neef, a teenage human girl who has been snatched from our world to the fairy NYC and exchanged for a fairy changeling. Neef is mortal and human, she does not perfectly fit the fairy world, but this is her home and they are her people, the only ones she knows. She, predictably, gets herself into trouble, predictably and very consciously (because, hell, she knows the fairy rules!) goes on a quest and there she meets her predicably present magical companion.Who turns out to be the fairy changeling left to her parents in her place. She is, from what we may see, a partially disabled young teenager (all signs point at her being seriously autistic), living with her loving, caring family in the modern NYC. Sherman's use of the old bit of folklore (the common belief that changelings are difficult children) to create an unusual, intriguing character. Jennifer, nicknamed Changeling by Neef, is seen by the readers only through Neef's eyes; she does not get to be the ppoint of view. But the combination of what Neef says and what a modern reader can infer from Changeling's comments, makes for a flawed, problematic, yet very humane and likeable character of a disabled girl who has to at least partially overcome her problems to survive; which, one may add, does not make her overcome them forever (she's still prone to panic attacks and she hates to be touched) and be magically made perfect; such little touches of realism are one of the book's strongers points. Both Changeling and Neef are slightly alien to the worlds they live in (a feeling, as I recall, shared by the vast percentage of teenagers of this world, fairy or not), but Sherman does not give us a wish-fulfillment fantasy in which the fairy will return to the fairies and the human girl to the humans. Neef's world is the fairy one, while Changeling, despite her origins, feels at home with humans - that is as it should be and this is the solution the characters are aiming for. Neither will there be a happy ending with undying friendship and friendly visits to the other's world, I'm afraid... The novel is beautifilly constructed, with a fairytale structure and the perfect doubling of the title characters. Neef and Changeling are completely different in characters, upbringing and attitude; yet at the same time they share the original name and surname and in fact, with Changeling being a replacement for the stolen Neef, they are, in a way, one person. And the book title, referring to both of them, makes it obvious that, indeed, we have two different-and-yet-the-same protagonists here.Only after I finished the book, I realized that this is a novel about the girls' quest and female helpers. Yes, we have important male characters here: the Pooka, Neef's tricker-turned-fairy-godfather, the Curator, Genius of the Metropolitan Museum and the unpleasant tengu called Carlyle, are the most prominent ones. Yet the majority of the actual action is done by girls (Neef and Changeling) with girls' (the vampiress Honey, the Dragon assistant-artist Fleet) help and with magical support from some men (the Curator, Pooka), but mostly from women (Bastet the cat goddess-figurine); and Neef does what she does at least partly because she wants to return home to her fairy godmother Astris, the white lady rat, who is the only mother she ever really knew. I wholeheartedly recommend the novel to those of the readers who like young adult novel - or those who want something nice, intriguing, moderately scary and rather charming to read to the children of their families.", "Neef is a changeling, a human baby stolen by fairies who lives in the Central Park of New York Between, an Otherworld Manhattan that co-exists with our own, inhabited by all sorts of Fairy Folk. Neef (whose real name she doesn\u2019t care to disclose to just anybody since \u2013 as you know \u2013 real names have power) has been brought up by her fairy godmother the white rat Astris and lives under the protection of The Green Lady, the Genius of the Central Park. Neef\u2019s days are spent in relative tranquillity, learning about Folk Lore and attending lessons at her world\u2019s (awesome) version of the Metropolitan Museum.But Neef is super curious and yearns for adventures. And it is that curiosity that lands her in trouble and she ends up (unknowingly) violating a geas put on her and breaking Fairy law. The result is that she is to be banished from home after losing the protection of the Green Lady, effectively becoming prey to the Wild Hunt. But there is always a way out or a bargain to be made when it comes to the Folk and so Neef and her friends convince the Green Lady to accept a deal: Neef is to go in search of three objects, all of them close to impossible to obtain. Even as scared as she is, Neef takes the challenge as it ought to be taken: as an opportunity to go on a quest and to finally live a Grand Adventure. And a Grand Adventure she has \u2013 from being kidnapped to meeting her fairy changeling, from facing mermaids and dragons to meeting the Bull of Wall Street, it\u2019s all very worthy of a cool heroine who deals with all the obstacles with smarts and determination (and sometimes, tears).At the end there is definitely some growth (as any real quester will tell you) and so Neef grows up but interestingly enough, she doesn\u2019t grow human \u2013 or at least, I didn\u2019t read it as such. Her sense of ethic is shaped and determined by the Folk stories she knows. She has been completed integrated to her life \u2013 she never once thinks about leaving her fairy life for a mortal life, for example. She also knows all the supposed rules of a Quest and everything that relates to stories and she uses this knowledge to her advantage, even when it means breaking those very rules. Part of what made this book such a pleasure to read was the fact that Neef has so much awareness about Fantasy and Folklore tropes. I also loved how varied those stories were as the premise is that the mortal immigrants who moved to NY from all over the world have taken the Folk \u2013 and their stories \u2013 with them and even beloved book characters become alive in New York Between.That said, I picked Changeling to read after reading and loving Delia Sherman\u2019s amazing The Freedom Maze and I was curious to see how both books compared (or not). I am saying this as a matter of full disclosure: this is how I read this book. So, they are very different books in the end, with very different stories and motives. But I thought it was very interesting that both heroines shared a couple of traits. Both departed on their stories because of the similar impetus that both protagonists shared: the desire to go on an adventure. Plus, both of them loved stories and had a certain awareness of tropes relating to fairytales. The difference lies in how The Freedom Maze\u2019s heroine awareness did not help her at all because, even though there were fantastical elements in that story, she was living in the \u201creal world\u201d whereas Neef uses those to her advantage and with success \u2013 but then again, Changeling is a Fantasy story through and through.That also transcribes in how the two stories progress: Changeling is a very, very light romp \u2013 even when Neef is at dangerous moments, that danger never really comes through. In fact, that is my biggest problem (if I can even call it that, considering how I enjoyed it) with Changeling: considering the stakes, considering the creatures Neef has to face, the challenges proved to be extremely easy and work out perfectly in the end. I wondered: isn\u2019t it also part of traditional stories that there are great costs to a protagonist on a quest? In that sense, I thought that The Freedom Maze explored that idea much better. Having said that I am also very much aware of the fact that it is not really fair to compare the two books on those grounds but there you have it.Changeling is supposed to be a light, fantastical romp with a very cool heroine and on its own, it is one of the most imaginative Middle Grade Fantasy stories I\u2019ve had the pleasure to read."], "The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America": ["The Lost Continental: A Look at Bill BrysonI must preface this essay by saying that if everyone didn\u2019t like this Bill Bryson book as much as I didn\u2019t (at least the person he is in this book), he would be about the wealthiest author on the planet. At least I bought it. I have several of his books and have read all of them. Bill Bryson can be assured that with detractors like me, he doesn\u2019t need fans. I should also say that I have lived a full one quarter of my life outside of the United States and I don\u2019t care if someone makes fun of anything and everything American (I\u2019ve done a bit of bashing myself). A dyspeptic man in his middle thirties, whose constant bad mood seems more like someone in their mid seventies, drives around the U.S. and complains about absolutely everything he sees, smells, hears, and eats. If this sounds like your idea of a good time, read Bill Bryson\u2019s The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America (Abacus, 1990).He constantly mocks small towns in America by referring to them by such names as Dog Water, Dunceville, Urinal, Spigot, and Hooterville\u2014and this is in the first five pages. Don\u2019t worry about the intrepid insulter running out of clever names for hick towns; Bryson has a million of them and he uses every single one.The only things about which Bryon has a favorable view are natural wonders and the homes of rich people. He marvels at the obscenely-posh residences of ultra-wealthy, early 20th century industrialists on Mackinac Island which were built before income taxes and most labor laws. He would probably be thrilled with pre-revolutionary France or Czarist Russia. One of his very few favorable reviews of American cities was of the ski town of Stowe, Vermont which caters almost exclusively to the rich.When he is traveling through the southwest he complains about the Mexican music on the radio. He seems more content to resort to bigotry than to come to some sort of understanding about the culture he is visiting. In my opinion, it\u2019s always more interesting to praise something that you understand than to mock something that you don\u2019t. I would have taken the time to translate a few of the songs and tell readers what they are about. In fact, I have done this and Mexican ranchera music is all about stories of love, heartbreak, and often violence which describe the cowboy culture of Mexico\u2019s northern territories. Bryson implies that the people who listen to this music are just too stupid to realize that it is only one tune played over and over.He gripes about a weatherman on TV who seems rather gleeful at the prospect of a coming snow storm yet Bryson seems to relish in the idea of not liking anything that he experiences in his journey. His entire trip is like a storm he passes through. Just once I wanted him to roll into some town that he liked and get into an interesting conversation with one of its residents.Here are examples of the cheeriness with which Bryson opens a few of his chapters:\u201cI drove on and on across South Dakota. God, what a flat and empty state.\u201d\u201cWhat is the difference between Nevada and a toilet? You can flush a toilet.\u201d (One reviewer called Bryson \"witty.\")\u201cI was headed for Nebraska. Now there\u2019s a sentence you don\u2019t want to have to say too often if you can possibly help it.\u201d\u201cIn 1958, my grandmother got cancer of the colon and came to our house to die.\u201d This last event must have brought untold joy to the young writer.Tell us more, Bill. His narrative is more tiresome than any Kansas wheat field he may have passed on his road trip through hell. Most Americans seem to be either fat, or stupid, or both in the eyes of Bryson. I can only assume that Bryson himself is some sort of genius body builder (although in his photo on the book jacket he's a fat schlub). Just one time I wanted him to talk to a local resident over a beer or a cup of coffee. I wanted him to describe his partner in conversation as other than fat or stupid. Not even one time do we hear about a place from somebody who lives there. We could just as easily have read the guidebooks as Bryson did and he could have stayed home and saved himself thousands of miles of misery.Whenever someone starts to tell me about somewhere they went I ask them to describe their favorite thing about the trip, be it a place, food, the people, or whatever. If they start to complain about the place I either change the subject or walk away if I can. Travel is supposed to broaden the mind, not make it narrower.", "It's funny how so many Americans begin their reviews of 'The Lost Continent' with statements such as \"I loved Bryson's other books but this one is terrible!\", all because he treats America the same way as he treats everywhere and everyone else.So while many Americans think it's acceptable - hilarious, even - for Bryson to make disparaging-but-witty comments about non-Americans and the places they call home, it is an utter outrage for him to be anything other than completely worshipful with regard to America and Americans.The unavoidable, undeniable fact of the matter is that Bill Bryson's 'The Lost Continent' is not only one of his finest works, but one of the best books ever written by anyone in recent times about the USA and Americans.It is as funny as anything you'll ever read, as well as being touching, poignant and fascinating. It is the first book I've read since 'Neither Here Nor There' (also by Bryson) that has caused me to think of calling my travel agent.America has never been half as interesting as it is in 'The Lost Continent' and Americans ought to be supremely grateful it was written and published.Five stars and highly recommended.", "In which a bilious Bryson, returning to the U.S. after living in England, borrows his mom\u2019s car (with her permission) and sets out to find the perfect American small town.Bryson kind of loses focus of his main task along the way, but that doesn\u2019t prevent him from slinging his jibes at 38 of the lower U.S. states.This one\u2019s almost as funny as the other Bryson books I\u2019ve read, but he seems to have a stick up his behind for most of it and the sometimes nasty barbs at middle Americans lose steam fairly quickly.A nice quota of belly laughs are found herein, but you\u2019ll be shaking your head and saying, \u201cWhat the Hell, Bill?\u201d more often than not.", "Well, ain't it somethin for dat rascally Mr. Bryson wit all o dat funny Northern talk to make his way down here to Dixie and spend some time wid us! We sure do 'ppreciate you takin us into your rich and well-knowed book, Mr. Bryson. And yer gosh-darn-right, God save all those poor folk who done shopped at K-Mart! They should've spent their nickels at Crate & Barrel had they knowed what to do wid demselves.....", "This is the worst book ever. Bryson is a fat, cynical white guy traveling around the country, proclaiming in the subtitle: \"Travels in Small Town America.\" But like most fat white guys, Bryson is scared of small town America. He hates every small town he comes to- whether they're on Indian reservations, small farming communities in Nebraska, southern towns full of African Americans where the author is too scared to even stop the car, or small mining communities in West Virginia, also where the author is too scared to stop. How can you write a book about small town America when you're too scared to stop in any small towns??? His favorite towns? Pittsburg and Charlotte. (Definitely \"small\" in my world.)Driving through the north woods, crossing the border from Maine to New Hampshire: \"The skies were still flat and low, the weather cold, but at least I was out of the montony of the Maine woods.\"In Littleton, on the Vermont border: \"People on the sidewalk smiled at me as I passed. This was beginning to worry me. Nobody, even in America, is that friendly. What did they want from me?\"At a cemetery in Vermont: \"I stood there in the mile October sunshine, feeling so sorry for all these lukles speople and their lost lives, reflecting bleakly on mortality and my own dear, cherished family so far away in England, and I thought, 'Well, fuck this,' and walked back down the hill to the car.\"At least he freely refers to himself as a \"flinty-hearted jerk-off.\"Maybe Mr. Bryson should get off his lazy ass, stop whining about England, and actually stop the car once in a while. This book spouts so much hateful white guy racism that I can't even bring myself to give it away. While I am 100% against burning or destroying any kind of book, I simply cannot let this one leave my hands. It will probably just find someone who agrees with it's horrible twisted and pessimistic point of view! I haven't decided if I'm going to just bury it in my storage space (which may mean when I leave my apartment someone else might pick it up), or \"accidentally\" drop it in a snowbank outside. At least in spring the pages would all be glued together, and no one would be able to read it ever again.", "I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.\nThus begins Bill Bryson his travelogue, setting the tone for what is going to follow: he is a smart-aleck, and he is going to be at his sarcastic best in taking down small-town America through which he is going to travel.Des Moines in Iowa is a typical small town in America where nothing ever happens and nobody ever leaves, because that is the only life they have known and they are happy with it. But not so young Bill \u2013 he watched one TV show on Europe when he was ten and was consumed with a desire to become European. After a steady diet of National Geographics during his adolescence, Bryson left for England and settled there. However, during his middle age, he was filled with a sense of nostalgia for small-town America, and the journeys he had across them with his family as a child.Bryson\u2019s father was an inveterate traveller who compulsively took his family on vacations every year. These would have been extremely enjoyable except for two issues \u2013 Senior Mr. Bryson\u2019s penchant for getting lost as well as his unbearable thrift (as Bill says, \u201c[h]e was a child of the Depression and where capital outlays were involved he always wore the haunted look of a fugitive who has just heard blood hounds in the distance\u201d) which made him avoid good restaurants and forced them to stay almost always in rundown motels.But as happens to most of us, the onset of age made Bryson view these journeys more and more favourably through the rose-tinted glasses of fond memory; until one day he came back to the home of his youth and set across the country of his birth in an ageing Chevrolet Chevette. He made two sweeps in all, one circle to the East in autumn and another to the West in spring. His experiences during these two journeys are set forth in this hilarious and compulsively readable book.---If one is familiar with Bryson, one knows what to expect from his books \u2013 sarcastic humour, bordering on the cruel; enthralling snippets about history and geography; and really expressive descriptions of the places he visited. All these trademarks are in evidence here. By the time I finished this book, I found that I possessed a surprisingly large amount of information about America, what landmarks to visit, and what famous personalities lived where. Bryson writes with great feel and the place comes alive for you. His predilection for staying in small towns and seedy motels (the latter actually not by choice \u2013 many of the towns he ended up in the night did not have any other type of accommodation) shows up a facet of America the tourist is unlikely to see.But it\u2019s when he writes about people that Bryson gives free rein to his biting wit. The Illinois barmaid with \u2018Ready for Sex\u2019 written all over her face; the Mississippi policeman who asks \u201cHah doo lack Miss Hippy?\u201d (\u201cHow do you like Mississippi?\u201d); the Indian gentleman who would not stop questioning a hungover Bryson about the possibility of smoking inside a bus (who ultimately had to be shouted down); the geriatric pump attendant spraying petrol all over the place, with a burning cigarette butt stuck in his mouth... I can go on and on. Even though these people were used as the butts of jokes, I ended up loving them \u2013 they were so human.And of course, one can\u2019t forget Bryson\u2019s signature comments about America.\nThe whole of the global economy is based on supplying the cravings of two per cent of the world's population. If Americans suddenly stopped indulging themselves, or ran out of closet space, the world would fall apart.---When you grow up in America you are inculcated from the earliest age with the belief - no, the understanding - that America is the richest and most powerful nation on earth because God likes us best. It has the most perfect form of government, the most exciting sporting events, the tastiest food and amplest portions, the largest cars, the cheapest gasoline, the most abundant natural resources, the most productive farms, the most devastating nuclear arsenal and the friendliest, most decent and most patriotic folks on earth. Countries just don't come any better. So why anyone would want to live anywhere else is practically incomprehensible. In a foreigner it is puzzling; in a native it is seditious.\nAnd this hilarious quip about ONE PARTICULAR AMERICAN...\nOn Fifth Avenue I went into the Trump Tower, a new skyscraper. A guy named Donald Trump, a developer, is slowly taking over New York, building skyscrapers all over town with his name on them, so I went in and had a look around. The building had the most tasteless lobby I had ever seen - all brass and chrome and blotchy red and white marble that looked like the sort of thing that you would walk around if you saw it on the sidewalk. Here it was everywhere - on the floors, up the walls, on the ceiling. It was like being in somebody's stomach after he'd eaten pizza.\nOne may ask, whether after the journey, was Bryson satisfied? Well, maybe not fully:\n...there are three things you just can\u2019t do in life. You can\u2019t beat the phone company, you can\u2019t make a waiter see you until he\u2019s ready to see you, and you can\u2019t go home again.\nThis is something which all of us must have felt one time or the other: the landscapes of our youth can be visited only through memory.", "Bryson does two things very well in this book, besides his trademark humour which is happily a constant in this and every other book he's ever written. He captures the spirit of the land at a very specific time in its recent history: 1987, the high water mark of the Reaganite project. Time and again, he is left demoralized by the mindless affluenza that was the hallmark of American society during the latter half of the 1980s. More broadly, Bryson leaves a depressingly accurate description of the tawdriness and vulgarity of America's built environment - a cement desert of motels, burger joints, gas stations, strip malls, freeways and parking lots repeated ad nauseam throughout the Lower 48 - that is painfully recognizable even 25 years later. If you have ever wondered at the wanton debasement that has been visited on the land by its greedy natives, if you have ever been saddened by the pitiless ugliness that surrounds you in America's cities, towns and suburbs, then surely this book is for you. Afterwards, read Edward Abbey and Philip Connors to cleanse your soul and to give thanks for the national parks and wildernesses that still do a stalwart job of protecting nature's beauty and grandeur against a hostile population. PS This was Bryson's first book. The opening lines - \"I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.\" - must constitute one of the great introductions by any writer in contemporary literature.", "Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who's noticed the fact that Bill Bryson is a smug bastard who casts a pall of depressing sarcasm over everything he writes about. I mean, I'm all for sarcasm in most cases, but it's as though all of his subjects are cheapened and made despicable by his prose. In The Lost Continent, he turns every small-town inhabitant into an ignorant, obnoxious caricature. The book has virtually nothing to offer, unless you, too, are hell-bent on whining about the constant ennui of middle-American travel. If you'd like a travelogue with value and interest, try Blue Highways, by William Least Heat Moon, who actually has some respect for his fellow human beings.", "When reading this book, American readers may very well feel like they are eavesdropping on a conversation not intended for their ears. This is because Bill Bryson obviously intended this book to be read by a British audience. There are lots of laughs in this book. His depictions of Iowa made me laugh until I had tears in my eyes. For example, his explanation for why so many farmers are missing fingers:\"Yet, there is scarcely a farmer in the Midwest over the age of twenty who has not at some time or other had a limb or digit yanked off and thrown into the next field by some noisy farmyard implement. To tell you the absolute truth, I think farmers do it on purpose. I think working day after day beside these massive threshers and balers with their grinding gears and flapping fan belts and complex mechanisms they get a little hypnotized by all the noise and motion. They stand there staring at the whirring machinery and they think, 'I wonder what would happen if I just stuck my finger in there a little bit.' I know that sounds crazy. But you have to realize that farmers don't have whole lot of sense in these matters because they feel no pain. It's true. Every day in the Des Moines Register you can find a story about a farmer who has inadvertently torn off an arm and then calmly walked six miles into the nearest town to have it sewn back on. The stories always say, 'Jones, clutching his severed limb, told his physician, 'I seem to have cut my durn arm off, Doc.' It's never: 'Jones, spurting blood, jumped around hysterically for twenty minutes, fell into a swoon and then tried to run in four directions at once,' which is how it would be with you or me.\"This stuff cracks me up. Maybe it's because I grew up in Iowa too. From an American's point of view, I was at times amazed by the important landmarks Bryson missed seeing or failed to appreciate. He drove by Monticello, for heaven's sake! In Springfield, Illinois, he \"drove around a little bit, but finding nothing worth stopping for\" he left -- Springfield, Illinois -- the home of Abraham Lincoln and his burial place! He passed up touring the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, because it cost too much! He called Gettysburg a flat field -- a battlefield of such varied topography as to make one wonder whether Bryson actually visited it! He missed Lake Tahoe! He also missed seeing Acadia National Park near Bar Harbor, Maine. Nor did he have any lobster along the Maine coast. Yet he felt informed enough to conclude that there was nothing special about Maine. Hurrumph! These failings may be forgiven though, because he has lived away from the United States for a long time. And, to be fair, he traveled far and wide and saw many wonderful places. From his well-written depictions, I've regained a desire to see places in the United States I haven't visited yet, including Savannah, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Mackinaw Island, Michigan. Overall, I enjoyed the book and enjoyed many laughs in reading it, which is why I like reading Bryson's books so much. But he seemed to tire out toward the end of the book and toward the end of his travels. His outlook became more and more jaundiced -- which is not good, when his outlook is generally jaundiced to begin with. Part I is the best part of the book, which focuses on the Midwest and East Coast. Part II, about Bryson's travels in the West, seems tacked on and unnecessary for the book (except for his description of his drive through the Colorado mountains to Cripple Creek and his depiction of his first view of the Grand Canyon (\"The fog parted. It just silently drew back, like a set of theater curtains being opened, and suddenly we saw that we were on the edge of a sheer, giddying drop of at least a thousand feet. 'Jesus!' we said and jumped back, and all along the canyon edge you could hear people saying, 'Jesus!' like a message being passed down a long line. And then for many moments all was silence, except for the tiny fretful shiftings of the snow, because out there in front of us was the most awesome, most silencing sight that exists on earth.\")). *There is some swearing in the book.", "I was excited to read this book. I've owned it for a few years now, and it's one of those books that I would see on my shelf and I'd think, this is going to be good, I better save it for another day when I guess I deserve to read something good rather than now when I should read something I'm not looking forward to. Or whatever it is that my thought process is about delaying gratification of books that I actually want to read versus a good deal of the books that I end up reading.This should have been in the, why don't you just read this because then you can get it out of your apartment; or hey you have lots of really good unread books, Greg, so why don't you pick one of the mediocre ones that have been collecting dust and read that instead of something you might really like. Or maybe one of the, you are a worthless piece of shit, Greg, and you don't deserve to read anything good, so read this instead. It was one of those books.But I meant to like it.I've only read one other Bill Bryson book, and I loved it. His history of American English, was wonderful. It was informative and witty and sprinkled with all kinds of nerd-tastic little facts and tidbits. That's what I was expecting here. A witty and fun look filled with lots of interesting little facts about various small towns in America. Instead it was a book about a guy a little younger than me, driving across country, spending most of his time in his car by himself and making some sort of funny and more not-funny at all remarks about America, and stopping at various tourist traps and historical sites where he inevitably grumbles about merchandising, any cost involved, and how bored he is by historical sites (so, um, don't go to them, it's a big fucking country) Parts of the book are enjoyable, but too much of it is just snarky little comments that haven't aged too well in the twenty five years since the book was published. I have no idea, but it came to me while I was making dinner and thinking about finally writing something about this book, is that the book must have originally been commissioned by an English publisher. Let's send the ex-pat, mid-western chubby guy back to his country with his affected English accent and let him give us some droll commentary on the big lumbering oaf of a country that was once one of our colonies. I didn't think of that while reading the book, but it is the only explanation I can come up with for his Balkie-esque Perfect Strangers reaction to things like Friday the 13th and Mr. Ed. In the contemporary equivalent it would be like me summing up my evening by letting you know that Survivor was on TV, which is about doofuses on an island, but not something I would ever watch, but this country just loves doofuses on an island (does anyone watch this show still? I tried to watch an episode a couple of months ago and it confused me. Yet another sign that I'm getting dumber, like bordering on being mentally retarded dumb lately). Too much social commentary about the 'current state of America' as seen from the eyes of someone who hasn't lived in the country for quite awhile, but most of it wasn't really that interesting, like it was sort of things that I was very well aware of at the time this book was written and I was about 14 at the time. Cineplexs were painfully small venues to see a movie in, the homogeneity of suburban sprawl was everywhere, historical battle sites weren't really that interesting (especially Gettysburg, which if you want to really have an unfun time go visit in the tail end of winter and walk twenty miles through bleak fields with a fairly unchanging landscape, while having strep throat, that makes the experience that much better, really), the people in horror movies are universally stupid and get killed because of their stupidity, radio sucks and plays the same songs over and over again. These are just a few of the things I'm remembering from the book.As the book moves on it gets a little better. Maybe Bryson had some insights. He stops saying stupid shit like, I was driving from Butt Crack, Virginia, though Yokle-ville heading to I'm Gonna Bang my Sister Tonight, West Virginia when I ate a terrible meal at some dinner where good ol' boys were all hanging out. His quest to find the perfect small town seems to disappear, and he stops gripping about the deficiencies of so many places he stops in at not meeting up with his Mayberry ideal (or maybe it's just that the last part of the book is in the West, and you just don't expect that sort of thing there?). He starts to realize that it's outsiders like himself who want this idealized town, with it's quaint pragmatic shops, when the people who live in towns like having conveniences like supermarkets and fast food restaurants, and don't necessarily want to live in a petrified pretty past. Maybe they all just want that quaint little town to be somewhere else, a few towns over where they can go visit on a Sunday, but for the rest of the time they like being able to get stuff easily. Not that I'm saying all that stuff is good or that the convenience of a Wal-Mart, or a road covered in big box stores is good, but I can see how you would like to have those things near by (I come from a town that attempts to be picturesque, and there were (still are?) uproars when the real sprawl of Wal-Mart et al, started, back in the early 90's. I liked voicing my annoyance at these 'awful' stores, too. I liked bashing Barnes and Noble for destroying small bookstores, but you know what the small bookstore in my town was terrible. The small stores in the picturesque downtown were filled with shitty things that catered to an idealized idea of what you would find in a small downtown of a city/town trying to artificially hold on to the past while also kissing up to tourists and parents of college students up for a weekend. I can go and buy a pewter horse with no problem, but if I needed to buy something I actually could use the whole downtown was pretty much worthless, and it's not like that was a big change that came about after the big box stores came in (I originally typed big fox stores, what an awesome idea, giant stores that either sell foxes or are run by foxes, either way I'm totally on board with that idea)). I didn't mean to start rambling on, but you know how it is. I guess what I mean to say is that I have mixed feelings about some of the homogeneity of suburban sprawl. I don't even remember what I still meant to write. I guess I'll wrap it up. Not very informative. The humor is kind of corny, immature and aged poorly. The idea of the trip is sort of weird. Drive for weeks at a time by yourself in a Chevette, while your wife and children are across the pond. I think if he had brought someone along with him the book would have been better. Or at least he'd have interactions with people who weren't mainly waitresses, motel clerks and gas station attendants. One reviewer, a friend of mine I think, said something like, it would have been nice if he actually talked to people in these small towns, instead of just talking to a waitress that might not be the sharpest tool in the shed and then declaring everyone dumb based on that one person. Ok, maybe I'm making up some of what this other person said, and exaggerating a little bit, but that is sort of the tone that much of this book takes. I was expecting more."], "The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way": ["The one thing that bothered me the most about this book was a huge error it had on swearwords, in reference to my mother tongue Finnish: (p. 210, Ch. Swearing, in my Penguin paperback:) \u201cSome cultures don\u2019t swear at all. (\u2026) The Finns, lacking the sort of words you need to describe your feelings when you stub your toe getting up to answer a phone at 2.00 a.m., rather oddly adopted the word \u201cravintolassa.\u201d It means \u2018in the restaurant.\u2019\"I mean, what the hell?! We Finns have probably the world's most colourful collection of swearwords. Someone pulled old Bill's leg, and did it properly too. That casts doubt on all he has written, really. And nobody says \"ravintolassa\" unless they do in fact mean \"in the restaurant.\"", "I have to share my discontent with the world after keeping the words bottled up inside me for so long.I bought this book about two or three years ago, thinking it might be an entertaining read that might fill me in on some of the historical aspects of the English language. I had already read \"A Short History Of Nearly Everything\", and, knowing nothing about science, thought it was a rather entertaining read, even though I had some... well, doubts about the book since I tend to favour more systematic and precise literature over a tapestry of facts with entertainment and jokes woven in. I also believe this to be one of the few books I have on my Goodreads shelves worthy of one star only.Why? Before I start, let me tell you two things: it has been a long time since I read the book, so my memory may not be as fresh anymore. The second thing I would like to mention is that I have some kind of idea about linguistics, but am not a linguist; where I am, however, a kind of expert, is in the study of foreign languages. I am therefore intimately acquainted with the workings of many foreign languages -- though almost all of them are European. I have also rather extensively studied the historical connections between languages and their classification in language families and so on.It is painfully obvious that Bryson speaks no foreign languages. Fine. Neither does Chomsky and he knows a thing or two about linguistics. You don't have to be a multilingual prodigy to study linguistics, after all. But I digress.Bryson makes the same mistake most monolingual speakers of any language make: they think of their language as something unique. Bryson tries to justify the popularity of the English language not with historical or political arguments (because I am sure that the colonization of a significant part of the world by the British Empire and the subsequent cultural and political hegemony of the United States had nothing to do with it -- nooo, English is magic!), but rather seems to believe that English has, through some kind of divine intervention, been miraculously endowed with characteristics that have made it \"beat the other languages\"... as if linguistics were some kind of free-market economy where the best product gets the biggest share of the market.Bryson then tries to argue the point with facts that are, while true for the most part, totally irrelevant. Seriously, this is like reading a paper by a student who's been watching one too many linguistic quiz shows on ITV, if such a thing existed; someone who likes to read trivia sections, and then pieces together the information obtained therefrom and tries to pass it off as knowledge to people unfortunate enough to be more ignorant than him. One \"fact\" that makes the English language so great, he says, is that it has \"so many more words than all the other languages\". How many words a language has, Bill, is not only something that cannot accurately be ascertained, but also something that is completely irrelevant. Why? In brief, language create composita in a different way, for instance; so where you might create a million different random words in German, in other languages, you have to link them together, meaning you will have less dictionary hits. Not that that has any bearing on the \"quality\" of the language. Some languages even HAVE to make more words because they have agglutinative qualities (such as Hungarian and Turkish; meaning they lump prefixes, suffixes, and other elements together, creating big lump words). Also, English is the dominant language of science; as such, a lot of the scientific vocabulary is included in dictionaries. Not that these words are usually English (except for the newer sciences like computer science, of course); they often come from Latin or Ancient Greek anyway. There are also more dictionaries being produced in English on account of it being more \"popular\", and the commercial production of English being more viable. As such, its lexicography can be assumed to be more advanced. \"Word count\" is as irrelevant as the number of brain cells or the size of the brain with regards to intelligence.This is my biggest beef with Bill's book. At one point, I had to stop reading. I should read it again and reiterate some of the other numerous \"arguments\" Bill Bryson puts forward in favour of the English language. I can only advise the author to commit himself to the study of foreign languages for a while, and to understand that \"fun facts\", no matter how objectively true they are, don't always have the meaning or significance someone thinks they have if one is not familiar with the field being discussed. Unfortunately, Bryson probably thought that he can easily trespass on this territory, since everyone who is able to speak must be a linguist. My review may sound harsh, but this book definitely does more harm than good. And people should remember that \"fun fact\" books, be they about natural sciences or linguistics, do not represent knowledge. I am sure that people endowed with a deeper understanding of natural science have shaken their head at \"A Short History Of Nearly Everything\" as well.", "The Mother Tongue is the story of the evolution of the English language, from its humble beginnings as a Germanic tongue to what it has evolved into over the centuries.So, Bill Bryson + cheap equals insta-buy for me, apparently. Too bad even Bill Bryson couldn't make this terribly entertaining.I have a long history as \"the obscure facts guy\" at social gatherings, at least, I did when people still invited me to such things. However, even I had trouble sticking with this one at times.Old Bill is in fine form, cracking wise and still being informative at every opportunity. He didn't get much in the way of interesting material to work with in this case.The book was not without its moments, however. I did enjoy the chapter on swearing, as well as numerous tidbits, or titbits, as they were called in a less prudish era, that peppered the other chapters. Too bad the gems were scarce and some of the reading resembled the back-breaking labor involved in mining.While I found the book informative and mildly amusing, at the end of the day, it's still a book about the history of words. Even one of the funnier travel writers alive can't make chicken salad from chicken feathers in this case. 2.5 out of 5.", "Non-fiction. Published in 1990, this book is already a little out of date. In its first pages, Bryson reports OED editor Robert Burchfield's theory that American English and British English are drifting apart so rapidly that within two hundred years we won't be able to understand each other. That was a theory made back when cell phones still required a battery the size of an unabridged dictionary, long before the internet became such a large part of the way the world communicates, in a time when you couldn't imagine downloading a British Doctor Who or an American Stargate Atlantis to your iPod. We live in a new world! Unfortunately it's also a world where the Harry Potter books are \"translated\" for American readers, lest we be too confused by the lingo: \"What's this? Harry's eating a biscuit? And wearing a jumper? While battling Fizzolian Snargletoothed Whatsits?! This book is impenetrable!\" JK Rowling aside, with communication technology becoming smaller, cheaper, and more powerful, I think we'll still be able to communicate two hundred years down the line. Bryson eventually disagrees with Burchfield for many of the same reasons, though he was unable to cite the internet as a factor.In that way, this book is showing its age -- the chapter on online language use is, of course, conspicuously absent -- but it's got the history part down. Bryson spends most of his time looking at how we got where we are today. Where English came from, how it got to England, where it went from there. With its in-text references, footnotes, extensive bibliography and index, this book looks almost academic, but Bryson, an American living in England, handles it all with a cheerfully low-key sense of humor -- almost as if Terry Pratchett had turned his eye to grammar -- and even a refreshingly open approach to the word fuck in the chapter on swearing.My one complaint is that, despite being loosely hung on British and American history, for the most part the book lacks a greater structure and ends up reading like a series of interesting facts. But, hell, they got my attention, and, as it happened, the attention of everyone around me: \"Hey! Did you know the Romans had no word for grey?\" Since English, as this book proves, is a big crazy mess, I guess Bryson can be excused for not being able to wrangle its history into a more pleasing order. Lack of structure aside, I really enjoyed reading this and will be reading more books by Bryson in the future.", "I know exactly a little bit about English, and a little bit less about linguistics in general. Studied a few foreign languages, took a linguistics class or two in college. I'm what you might call a big fan of language. A dabbler. Certainly not an expert. But boy, did I find this book infuriating.My problem with this book is that it gets so much right, and so much wrong. The example that really set me off was his treatment of the Welsh language. To Bryson, Welsh is \"as unpronounceable as it looks\", and Welsh pronunciations \"rarely bear much relation to their spellings.\" He then spouts off with a series of jokes that are so ethnocentric and condescending that, if you took them at face value, you couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor backward speakers of silly old Welsh.The problem is, he's completely wrong. I happened to study the phonology and orthography of Welsh for about a week in that freshman linguistics class (I know, that makes me a big authority, right?) but in that week I learned something Bryson apparently never bothered to look up: Welsh orthography is remarkably regular, about as regular as Spanish. It's not at all difficult if you bother to learn the rules, which are far simpler than those of English. (The fact that I learned them in one week, and remember them decades later, should be some indication of how easy they are.) The phoneme represented by the double-l is called a lateral fricative, and yes, it's hard to pronounce if you don't speak Welsh, but that does not mean it's sometimes pronounced \"kl\" and other times \"thl\" as Bryson suggests. It is always pronounced just like it's spelled. But Bryson's Anglo-American tin ear failed to pick that up, and he took his ignorance and turned it into a cheap joke at another culture's expense.Knowing that he got Welsh so wrong made me doubt all of the rest of the information in the book. And that's a real shame, because it covers such fascinating topics, and it's so very entertainingly written. But it's hard to enjoy Bryson's jokes when you have this nagging suspicion that he's bending the truth for the sake of a snappy punchline.", "What a hilarious, fascinating, and educational look at our wacky, wonderful, and WAY complicated language. If English is your mother tongue, this book will amaze and amuse you with interesting tidbits about just how our language evolved into the wonder it is. If you had to learn English as a second language (and more power to you), then bless your heart for taking on the task. You will read this book, and say YES, absolutely, I always wondered..., etc. Bill Bryson turns his sharp-eyes to \"The Mother Tongue\" and takes us all on a fabulous journey through and overview of the intricacies of human language. You will laugh, smile, and learn a few things while you're at it!!!", "1\u2605 (DNF)I thought this would be fun. I love words and languages and have a passing interest in linguistics. I started this with enthusiasm and was enjoying his breezy style until it occurred to me that a lot of what he was saying seemed to be anecdotal. You know, limited or no research. Then I thought, well, it was written more than 25 years ago, so things that sounded like old stories to me may have been new stories then \u2013 like this one:\n\u201cThe Eskimos, as is well known, have fifty words for types of snow\u2014though curiously no word for just plain snow. To them there is crunchy snow, soft snow, fresh snow, and old snow, but no word that just means snow.\u201d \nThere\u2019s a wealth of articles about this half-truth (I\u2019m being generous). Here\u2019s one http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca...So how many grains of salt would I need to swallow the declaration that immediately followed? An unhealthy amount, I\u2019m sure.\n\u201cThe Italians, as we might expect, have over 500 names for different types of macaroni.\u201d\nHe goes on to say these include \n\u201cspaghetti\n and \nvermicelli.\u201d\n He obviously means types of pasta.Then he got into some languages I have a smattering of myself \u2013 French and German\u2014and I began questioning. Some of it just sounded wrong, like the quote from an article that says most speakers of other languages aren\u2019t aware there is such a thing as a thesaurus.At this point, I decided I\u2019d read some reviews to see if anyone who knows more than I do felt the same way. Sadly, there are a lot. You can check the low-rating reviews on Amazon that actually discuss the many factual errors. I stopped reading, thinking I might accidentally absorb some of the \"facts\" and perpetuate them myself!How disappointing. One star for the writing.", "I teach English as a foreign language but other than that linguistics and language learning is just a hobby, having said that, I know enough Irish, German, Czech, Russian and Spanish to know that the things he said about these languages are half truths or complete and utter codswallop. For example claiming that the German preposition/suffix \"auf\" is unusual among foreign words in that it has more than one meaning... anyone who has spent any time learning a language will tell you that all of them have words with dozens of meanings (Except maybe Esperanto?). Furthermore there is no preposition in any language that cannot be translated into at least three or four prepositions in English, nor are there any English prepositions that don't have numerous translations in the other language. That's just how prepositions are! They don't translate!The first chapter of this book has so many mistakes that I couldn't finish it. Almost every sentence has a mistake.It is a collage of newspaper clippings. If you read the credits at the back you'll see that he only consulted newspapers and magazines and did no real research. I can't go through all the mistakes, I really don't have the time, there are just too many. If it continues in this way then this is a work of complete and utter fiction.I loved \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" and now I am frightened that if I knew anything whatsoever about \"Everything\" I would have found that that book too was filled with amusing but completely made up factoids.", "I always enjoy a Bill Bryson book. I love his sense of humour and the way he can turn the driest subject into something entertaining. Of course that does mean you cannot believe a word of it since he is always looking for the most shocking or the most amusing way to present each topic. Why ruin a good joke with the truth?So if you are looking for an erudite and trustworthy account of the development of the English language I am sure there are many very worthy tomes out there! This is just for fun and it is absolutely that, lots and lots of fun.Having said that there are lots of interesting bits which really make you think about what you say and write every day, things that you may have never actually noticed. Lots and lots of 'aha' moments:) I enjoyed it very much.", "Bryson's book on the English language is a compendium of linguistic trivia interspersed with the author's biased and misinformed musings on the history and features of the language. Published in 1990, the book was written before Internet changed the way the world communicates and hence a lot of the content regarding the spread of languages is hopelessly outdated by now.Bryson is not a linguist, neither is he a historian. Therefore his attempts to explain the popularity and status of English as the lingua franca of the modern world come off haphazard at best. Bryson's love for his native English is clear enough; so is his painfully obvious lack of knowledge of any other languages. I did not care to keep count of the times he falsely asserts some feature in English cannot be found in any other language or blatantly moves the goalposts to prove how infinitely richer English is compared to anything.For all the little anecdotes and copious bits of trivia it contains, I really want to like the book more than I do. Unfortunately once it becomes clear that many of these factoids won't stand up to closer scrutiny -- Bryson doesn't even blink as he repeats the age-old and very disputed claim that the Eskimos have 50 words for snow -- it becomes hard to believe anything the book claims.The most baffling and outrageous claim of all is the one that strikes closest to home. Bryson has the audacity to suggest we Finns have no native swear words and use the phrase \"in the restaurant\" as a curse instead. Perkele, I say."], "Traders, Guns & Money: Knowns and Unknowns in the Dazzling World of Derivatives": ["All but a few financial storytellers fall short in comparison with Michael Lewis. Satyajit Dasis is no exception. Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let\u2019s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn\u2019t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people \u2013 smart or na\u00efve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it\u2019s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they\u2019re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I\u2019m sure he has a point when he says many of today\u2019s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked. He weakens his case when he implies as much.", "Das, a derivatives and risk expert, takes a very snarky look at these complex products that exploded the financial world in 2008 (though he is writing in 2006). Few people understand them, but whenever investors are flush with cash, money has to end up somewhere, and it's often seeking the highest return. The quants who create them may understand the equations, but not the real world consequences. The salespeople who sell them don't really understand them, and the buyers - in a system ruled by asymmetric information, where the seller always knows more than the buyer - rarely ever do. Although not as dull or abstruse as a textbook, which Das also writes, this book does go into the weeds, and readers who have no knowledge whatsoever of derivatives will find themselves floating on a sea of mysterious acronyms, coupled with diagrams and flow charts.Das keeps it punchy with chapterette headings such as \"Rough Trade,\" \"Bondage,\" \"Dukes of Hazard,\" and \"Tranche Warfare.\" He tells us that heading into a trial preparation as a plaintiff's expert witness, where an Indonesian noodle company that had been snookered on some derivatives was suing the issuer, he had looked up Portia's \"quality of mercy\" speech from The Merchant of Venice as a precaution.The book is plagued by typos: missing apostrophes and quotation marks, and astonishingly, a consistent misspelling of Warren Buffett's name. Former Salomon head John Gutfreund is repeatedly referred to as \"John Gutenfreund.\"", "After reading this book, I learned how one of my annuities manages to guarantee the lesser of 6% per year or the actual market growth of my investments. (Zero coupon bond worth 106%, call option on my portfolio purchases, they keep a percentage for themselves.) I also learned that I was a sucker for buying into this annuity - except that I was lucky and did it a year before the market drop of 2008. Now if I can just get my 106% out...I was a big fan of Frank Portnoy's Fiasco and this is the geekier version with more finance than most people want to read. The author, Das, also includes stories of derivatives deals which drive home how outmatched most purchasers, no matter how sophisticated they think they are (Fortune 500 CFO's et al), compared to the folks who spend their entire days thinking of novel financial vehicles.", "Definitely not one of the better books on the subject. There are two major faults with this one:First, the writing is all over the place, with the author jumping hither and thither every other paragraph, with almost no cohesion.Second, there are a great deal of technical bits that are not explained well at all, and some times they don't even need to be that technical.Some interesting anecdotes and case studies, all marred by these downsides.", "This book gets very technical and it is obvious that the author adapted his style to be similar to Nassim Taleb. If you can put up with it, Das gets into several very good explanations about the many types of derivatives used to bend tax-laws, redirect risk, and confuse investors.", "A humorous account of the post crisis financial institutions. While the key concepts around derivatives i.e. weapons of mass destruction are explained without use of jargon, it get repetitive and tedious towards the later chapters.", "A long walk for a medium sized drink that gets warm by the end. This is no Michael Lewis book, which is what I thing most readers desperately want it to be. The reader will be challenged which is good and bad. I have to admit this was one of the hardest books I've ever read as the material is pretty thick. The depth of the subject covered in this book not for a casual audience. I probably now know more than I'll ever want to about derivatives, and more than I probably should about the internal dealings of Wall Street. I agree with the Financial Times assessment from the cover that this is fascinating reading, but only for those who are deeply, deeply interested in the topic. I was pulled in by the title's inclusion of the word \"guns\" as I was hoping for a book similar to \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\" by John Perkins. I was looking for more adventure and explosions or something with at least hit of espionage, in fact I don't think a gun ever made an appearance, so I felt suckered by the title. This book really was closer to a text book study of derivatives or at least one man's life story of working in derivative markets on Wall Street, than anything having to do with guns. Though perhaps I just didn't go all in on the metaphor the author was trying to push on the reader. I prefer the analogy that derivatives are closer to WMD's, not guns.The book is a bit more interesting reading in 2015, as it was published in 2006 before the big crash. The author makes many points that you cringe reading in hindsight about just how out of hand things had gotten during the era of his authorship. Many \"shame on us\" moments, but when has that ever stopped us (the American public) before, and doubtful it will stop us in the future. If you are the right audience for this, dive right in, other wise pass on by as it's going to be a long journey.", "I take back what I said earlier, which is that Traders, Guns and Money is rather disappointing for such a critically acclaimed book. I still stand by what I said about the book's tone -- from the punchy three-word title you could recognise it for the way it reads, sort of a stand up comic routine on the derivative markets. The first half wasn't especially compelling, as the castigation of financial professionals is so generalised. You have to be offensive to be funny, I guess. Once you get past that, the second half rocks -- perhaps because I don't take any personal offense, not being involved in derivatives. It's a great insider's view of how and why derivatives evolved, with great and simple (and cynical) explanations of why various structures were created (generally, to evade taxes, get around trading regulations, and other ways to give investors more yield and earn banks more fees). The anecdotes and narrative read like a late-night drink confessional -- probably exaggerated but sounding true enough in essence, and deeply educational. As mentioned previously, it doesn't claim to be a rigorous, comprehensive risk management textbook (which Das has written) so it won't be that sort of educational if that's what you're looking for.But through anecdotes it gives a sharp sense of the culture of the people involved, something you could never find even in very good textbooks.", "I did learn a few things about derivatives from this book. For example, I had not previously realized how mark to market accounting can be used to inflate profits and traders' bonuses and can lead to margin calls on illiquid top level CDO tranches when the failure of lower tranches causes a ratings downgrade in upper level tranches that would probably actually pay full value if held to maturity, so even if the models were right in predicting tiny risks of default, the accounting rules helped to accelerate the financial crisis. The book does a good job in showing how derivatives can create an economic house of cards rather than having positive value in increasing liquidity and stability. But in trying to be light and numerous, the author frequently becomes too cynical and snarky. And he could have gone a bit deeper than he did in explaining the math and the modeling. Surely it can't all be as much of a shell game as the author suggests, or if it is, I wish that he would have given me a little more substance to reach that conclusion on my own.", "This book was a fictionalized story about high finance that was less entertaining than anything written by Michael Lewis, but Lewis sets the bar pretty high. It is about a trader who worked in the British banking system and his attempt to defend an Indonesian company that blew itself up with derivatives and leverage. The fake names (Nero and Neverfail) that he gives people are just a little too ridiculous. Most of the math that he is trying to explain is excellent. Off-hand, the only numerical error I noticed in this book was a point where I am pretty sure that a number that was supposed to be $1,000 million was written as $1,000 billion. The book does explain things like derivatives and CDOs, but a lot of that went flying over my head.His cynical view of the fail states of various business practices described in either chapter 2 or chapter 3 were hilarious."], "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5)": ["Interview with JK Rowling...\nStephen Fry: Can we settle an important question?JK Rowling: Yes.Stephen Fry: How do you pronounce your last name?JK Rowling: It is Row-ling. As in rolling pin.Stephen Fry: So if any of you hear someone pronounce her name \u201cRohw-ling\u201d, you have my permission to hit them over the head with \u2014 not with Order of the Phoenix, that would be cruel. Something smaller, like a fridge.", "I finished this book with tears in my eyes and laughter on my lips.Just wow, excellent book!", "(obviously a reread) *cries*", "I had to re read it. I was in such a nostalgic mood.", "Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry\u2019s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM!The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he\u2019s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there\u2019s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy\u2019s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you anything about what we\u2019ve been doing, and we\u2019ve been doing A LOT. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll see you soon, we just can\u2019t tell you when\u201d? As if he hasn\u2019t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s Harry. Doesn\u2019t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what\u2019s best for him better than he does? And that\u2019s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children\u2019s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child\u2019s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren\u2019t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn\u2019t infallible. James Potter isn\u2019t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn\u2019t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that\u2019s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George\u2019s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry\u2019s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn\u2019t sunshine and roses and you don\u2019t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don\u2019t get the sense that Sirius\u2019s death was a righteous one. You don\u2019t get resolution. He didn\u2019t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don\u2019t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.This review can also be found at The Alliterates.", "I cried like a little baby. J.K. Rowling really starts taking the series down a darker road in this book. She is so talented at character development, and it really shines in this book. Here, Harry is 15 years old, and for most of the book, he's whiny and self-centered, just like a typical teenager. I also adore Dumbledore's role in this book--his conversation at the end with Harry put me to tears. Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge...never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her. I do have to admit, I'm curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not. For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot. Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot. I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death. As with all of her books, I have a really difficult time putting these books down, but especially within the last 100 pages, I physically could not separate the book from my hands. Overall, another outstanding addition from J.K.

I will start by saying that this is one of my least favorite books in the series, and that isn't because it's bad, BECAUSE IT IS DEFINITELY NOT. It's mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate, and having to read about her so much just infuriates me, rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I'm reading.That being said, here are some of my thoughts on the book:-mention of Regulus Black near the beginning of this book. I've noticed particularly during this re-read that J.K. Rowling tends to mention characters a book or two before they will have any importance to the story. She seriously knew what she was doing while writing these books.-it's so weird to think that Sirius is related to Narcissa and Bellatrix! Sirius is such an amazing human, and he was born into a terrible family, which is pretty true of a lot of people. Just because you come from something/somewhere terrible, that doesn't mean you can't be different and be good.-Ron and Hermione becoming prefects is just so great. Surely there would be a better candidate in their year to be the male prefect, yet Dumbledore chose Ron. Why? Because Dumbledore knows that Ron always feels worthless in comparison to his five older brothers, and him becoming prefect was enough to make him feel like a winner at something. Dumbledore is cool like that.-Quite often I forget that St. Mungo's exists since it's not in the movies at all. Here, we get to see Neville's parents, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (who is adorable now and not at all annoying), and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES.-it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year, as I LOVE Quidditch. and Harry was so sad because of it, which made him cranky and quite insane. HOWEVER, I love that Ginny took over for him as Seeker. I feel like Ginny has grown up so much already, and it's particularly in this book that I grew to really like her. She's so much better in the books than in the movies.-In the epic fight near the end of the book, NEVILLE IS SO BADASS. If you ever think that Neville isn't brave until the last book, you are wrong. He was throwing himself at Death Eaters and Stunning the shit out of everybody. It was awesome.-As usual, lots of information was revealed in the last couple of chapters of the book. This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books, as well as information that you probably didn't even think of.

He is an acclaimed author of nonfiction books, including Seven-Tenths, Three Miles Down, and Playing with Water, He currently lives in Italy.My Review: Cooking With Fernet Branca is part of oddball publisher Europa Editions's sinister plot to make Murrikins like me aware of the strange and sinister world of lit'rachoor published beyond our shores. Muriel Barbery owes her Murrikin presence to them, too. We all know how *that* turned out....Well, before moving any farther along in this review process, let me send out the call: Does anyone know how to get hold of (wicked double entendre optional) actor John Barrowman? You know, Captain Jack Harkness of Torchwood fame? He is literally missing the key to Murrikin stardom by not reading, optioning, and making this book into a movie. It suits every single national prejudice we have: Eastern Europeans as sinister lawbreaking peasants who eat strangely shaped, colored, and named things and call them foods (like Twinkies, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew are *normal*); Englishmen as dudis (you'll have to read the book for that translation) who do eccentric off-the-wall things with food that are repulsively named and gruesomely concocted (spotted dick? bubble-and-squeak?); and Italians as supercilious effete cognoscenti of world culture, who possess the strangest *need* for vulgarity.The characters in this hilarious romp are the most dysfunctional group of misfits and ignoramuses and stereotypes ever deployed by an English-language author. They do predictable things, yet Hamilton-Paterson's deftly ironic, cruelly flensing eye and word processor cause readerly glee instead of readerly ennui to ensue. The whole bizarre crew...the lumpenproletariat ex-Soviet composer, the Italian superdirector long past his prime, the English snob who refers to Tuscany's glory as \"Chiantishire\" and \"Tuscminster\"...gyrates and shudders and clumps towards a completely foreseeable climactic explosion (heeheehee). And all the time, snarking and judging and learning to depend on each other. In the end, the end is nigh for all the established relationships and the dim, Fernet Branca-hangover-hazed outlines of the new configurations are, well, the English say it best...dire.Read it. Really, do. And I dare you not to laugh at these idiots! Don't be put off by the sheer hideousness of the American edition's cover, in all its shades-of-purple garish grisliness. The charm of reading the book is that one needn't look at that...that...illustration...on the cover, but inflict it on those not yet In The Know enough to be reading it themselves.And seriously...John Barrowman needs to know about this.

Anyone can do the white-walls-and-black-beams bit, but it takes aesthetic confidence and an original mind to make something of a Tuscan mountain farmhouse that isn\u2019t merely Frances Mayes. It also takes a complete absence of salt-of-the-earth peasants and their immemorial aesthetic input. It is all rather heartening and as I work I break cheerfully into song. I have been told by friendly cognoscenti that I have a pleasant light tenor, and I am just giving a Rossini aria a good run for its money when suddenly a voice shouts up from near my ankles: \u2018Excuse, please. I am Marta. Is open your door, see, and I am come.\u2019 I break off at \u2018tutte le norme vigenti\u2019 and look down to find a shock of frizzy hair with an upturned sebaceous face at its centre. In this first part, the most hilarious two-dozen pages in the book, we view the world as seen by Englishman Gerald Samper \u2013 who refers to himself as a \u201cShropshire Samper\u201d \u2013 hunkered down in a cottage about as far off the beaten path as it is possible to get in the Apuan Alps of Northern Italy, practicing his trade as a ghost-writer, working on the autobiography of the lead singer of a boy-band; but also taking the opportunity to devote more time to his passion for cooking. The next section is told from Marta\u2019s point of view. Despite her Borat-like butchering of the English language, Marta, from the fictional ex-Soviet country of Voynovia \u2013 Voy-NO-via! \u2013 is every bit Gerry\u2019s intellectual equal. She is a composer, and has come to Italy to work on a score for a famous cult film director named Piero Pacini, although she has not seen any of Pacini\u2019s films. It is through Marta\u2019s eyes that we see \u201cGerree\u2019s\u201d flaws. Marta ends up copying Gerry\u2019s abysmal kitchen singing for the film, which for some reason is a perfect fit \u2013 it\u2019s possible this is a pornographic movie, though we aren\u2019t really sure. Gerry finds Marta slovenly and her music absolutely horrible \u2013 not recognizing its source. The agent has told each that the other would only be there a month and wanted nothing but seclusion. And there the misunderstandings and misadventures begin.Fernet Branca is \u201can herb-based liqueur\u201d perhaps better described as \u201ca bitter Italian spirit\u201d since not only is it liberally used in cooking, but both characters drink copious amounts of the stuff, each of course blaming the other for the excessive consumption. I assume also that the author intended at least some of his readers with too much time on their hands to stumble upon the fact that Fernet Branca is the preferred drink of the title character of Notti di Cabira, by Fellini; linking us to Marta\u2019s Pacini, perhaps? In any case, \u201cfooding\u201d as Marta is wont to call cuisine, is just one common fondness these two share. For their first dinner together, she serves him shonka, which Gerry describes as a gross sausage the colour of rubberwear and as full of lumps as a prison mattress. When he pokes it with the point of his knife, he hears the sound of a boil being lanced, yet in no time at all he\u2019s eaten a good two inches of the thing, with a mere yard to go. Gerry provides the dessert \u2013 Garlic and Fernet Branca Ice Cream \u2013 created to discourage Marta from becoming habitual in her visitations to his habitat. Of course she polishes it off with gusto, washed down with copious draughts of Fernet Branca. The story inevitably spins off into many directions \u2013 perhaps too many \u2013 and I have to confess that I was insufficiently exposed (wink-wink, nudge-nudge) to Monty Python in my youth, so it\u2019s possible I just didn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d, or else it was simply impossible for the author to keep his readers\u2019 spirits up after such a hilarious beginning. Technically, I must say I very much admired the author\u2019s use of the \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d here \u2013 one of the best examples I\u2019ve read in quite some time; especially using two alternating narrators, recalling One Hundred Dollar Misunderstanding, but fully milked in Fernet Branca for humour. I also found \u201cseasoning\u201d enough sprinkled throughout the story to read through to its conclusion, even though I\u2019d guessed it beforehand; as you will, too. But don\u2019t let that stop you. Cooking with Fernet Branca is a light, airy narrative that spins around two unique characters, is filled with many strange dishes and goings-on, and of course, after so much mention of Fernet Branca, you might feel as though you\u2019ve actually tasted it! At the very least, you will certainly hesitate before sipping an unfamiliar liqueur or tasting an exotic dish, especially after reading the recipe for Alien Pie, which calls for 500 grams of baby beet; a single drop of household paraffin; 1 kg smoked cat, off the bone, and\u2026 I expect you get the picture! Buon appetito!", "I admit it, I was click-baited into this by the headline/title and had no idea where the book would take me.However, as I hold Fernet Branca in high esteem, the temptation was irresistible, and as the saying goes, \u201cnever lay down a temptation, it may not come again\u201d. Once in my eternal youth I travelled through Uganda, with a bottle of Fernet Branca held closely to my heart. At time of travel a cholera outbreak was closing shops and markets at the leisurely speed of one mile/hour behind me, giving me a day\u00b4s head start. Thus, luckily escaping it, I am a true believer in the virtues of Fernet Branca, preventive as well as healing, not to mention it\u00b4s social aspects. That was my personal prologue \u2026\u201dUnder the Tuscan Sun\u201d, right outside Viareggio, on the brink of a ravine, there are two old houses with a, sometimes, fabulous view to the Mediterranean. By the sleaziness of the local real estate agent, they were both sold off as \u201csecluded and tranquil, \u201cand the neighbor rarely visits\u201d\u201d Just the kind of house Gerry the somewhat successful ghostwriter and Marta the composer from Voynovia would settle down for. It soon turns out that tranquility will be hard to find, and the neighbor is very much at home.Even strained from the very beginning, both parties are eager to maintain a good neighbor relationship, if only the other part would leave me in peace! The game is afoot, and we get to learn Gerry and Marta from each other\u00b4s perspective, both guessing and imagining what the neighbor is like, and both being wrong most of the time.I\u00b4m not going to spoil your fun, for fun it is when two people of very different backgrounds are trying to figure what the other part is up to. The very British stiff upper lip collides with an ex-Soviet exiled \u201cfear the worst from the West\u201d, and even the pictures are caricatured, they do not seem that far from reality. In no particular order, you will encounter a famous film director, a boyband front man, a mysterious night-flyer and a few more who are needed to make the storyline possible. Add to this a handful of very interesting recipes, recipes in which Fernet Branca will play a not unimportant part, Voynian delicacies and some good advice on DIY. And not least a generous share of \u2026 Fernet Branca. Sometimes silly, sometimes good-humored, but never boring, this meant-for-entertainment-only-novel gets a solid 4 stars.", "Cooking, crime & celebritizing collide - often hilariously -in this satiric tease on rustic retreats.

Their mischievousnessbecomes a perfect uncorked stimulant.Meet a Brit ghostwriter for celebs who settles in Tusc to write and cook in peace. Then a hearty woman composer fr Eastern Europe plumps down nearby to ponder a score for a fawncy Italian film director. She happens to have a gangster brother. Can they all get along?

Buon divertimento !", "I didn't manage to read this in Mexico, though I was told it would be the perfect smart-person airplane book, but I did pick it up as soon as I got back, and it was very much as promised: dryly hilarious, fast-moving, clever, and a whole lot of fun. Cooking With Fernet Branca is dual-ly narrated by two next-door neighbors living on the Italian countryside: Gerard Samper, a very proper Englishman and self-proclaimed \"master chef\" (more on that soon), who makes his money ghostwriting autobiographies for idiotic sports stars; and Marta, a somewhat bumpkin-ish composer from Eastern Europe (Voynovia, actually) who has been commissioned to write a film score for a famous arty and controversial Italian film director. So. Gerard and Marta are incredibly well-drawn characters, from her pidgin English and lovingly frazzled appearance to his fastidious mannerisms and constant stream of sarcastic inner monologue. They are both a bit unreliable as narrators, which is done with great subtlety at times, and then become very overt when the narrative switches sides and we get to see the same scene retold through the other's eyes. Their relationship is so complex, so changing, so real, that it carries the entire book brilliantly. See, they hate each other. I mean, each was told when they bought their houses that their immediate neighbor was quiet and calm, and would only be home maybe one month out of the year. But Marta's brother keeps stopping by in a helicopter in the middle of the night, and Gerard sings horrifically off-key opera while he avoids work by loudly building fences and other such, and each drives the other totally crazy with their drunkenness and terrifying cooking. And oh, the cooking!! This is where the book's darkest humor shimmers horrifyingly. Gerard, who punctuates his sections with explicitly detailed recipes, loves to cook. And the things he cooks are...well...not for the faint of heart. Examples include: stuffed udder in butterscotch sauce, smoked cat pot pie, parrots 'n' carrots, horse custard, and more and more. In fact, one of the subtle ways in which he wages war with Marta is with cuisine m\u00e9priseur, the cuisine of contempt. She \u2013 though unwittingly \u2013 does about the same thing, by always trying to feed him homemade Voynovian treats, which are every bit as horrifying to his palate as his deep-fried mice would be to hers. In any case, of course, they bicker and fight and scheme and plot, and eventually work their way into one another's good graces, more or less. There is much much more to this book than I have let on here, but I hope I have at least...whet some appetites, as it were, because I really think James Hamilton-Paterson ought to be better known. I plan to get both the other books he's written about Gerard and Marta tout suite, before the fall ends and I am expected to read more, er, serious literature.", "This is an odd one to judge: generally a pretty run-of-the-mill exercise, but with moments of real comic genius, in my view.I should say that I don\u2019t normally read comic novels (or intentionally comic novels), and reading this one rather reminded me why. There can be something hectoring about someone trying constantly to amuse you. I also have a very low tolerance of fart jokes.I was driven to comedy in this instance partly for circumstantial reasons (as an antidote to miserable February weather and a miserable February workplace), but partly also because Cooking with Fernet Branca has got some very good reviews. I liked the prospect of a novel narrated by his-and-hers unreliable narrators, and the Italian setting was another lure for me (off-piste Italy, as well, high in the Apuan Alps behind Camaiore, north of Lucca.)In the event, I found CWFB eminently forgettable\u2014it\u2019s already fading fast, although I only finished it a couple of days ago\u2014to the extent that it seems rather strange to me that it managed to scrape its way on to the Booker longlist in 2004. Presumably it got there by virtue of its themes of art and commerce and compromise, levered rather clunkily into the novel through the professions of the odd-couple narrators, Marta and Gerald, who are, respectively, a composer of art-film music and a ghost writer for celebrities (or \u201camanuensis to knuckleheads,\u201d in Gerald\u2019s characteristically scathing phrase.) What I liked best in CWFB were Gerald\u2019s recipes, which are a splendid antic sub-genre in themselves. (I also liked Gerald\u2019s invented Donizettian opera arias, mainly based on libretti found on the labels of DIY products: Non disperdere nell\u2019ambiente; Nuoce gravemente alla salute.) Gerald\u2019s culinary idiom is the crazed love-child of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s and Heston Blumenthal\u2019s. It combines the finicky (one recipe calls for a single stamen of saffron) with the queasily red-in-tooth-and-claw (\u201cJack Russells are a bugger to bone.\u201d) Alien Pie, with its smoked-cat base and \u201cjaunty\u201d buzzard-feather garnish, is surely Gerald\u2019s masterpiece, but I also enjoyed such simple treats as Log Jam, made from steeped oak twigs (a technique \u201cprobably lost since the Late Bronze Age\u201d)\u2014not to mention the promising notion of constructing recipes on the basis of consonance (Moth Broth; Poodles and Noodles; Horse Sauce.) As someone with the good fortune to be amorously paired with an ambitious cook (though happily not quite as ambitious as Gerald), I have picked up enough familiarity with the world of haute culinary fantasy that Hamilton-Paterson is parodying to have a sense of how well done this is. Pretentious cooking is an easy enough satirical target\u2014everyone does it\u2014but it\u2019s not easy to do it this well.", "COOKING WITH FERNET BRANCA. (2004). James Hamilton-Paterson. *****.\tI always get excited when I discover a new (to me) writer whose books are both well written and interesting. This writer is one of those. This is the first novel I\u2019ve read by him, but rest assured that it won\u2019t be the last. The author lives and works in Italy, but is thoroughly English. I don\u2019t know who we have in the U. S. that is like him, but the closest I can think of is Bill Bryson. This novel is both literate and comic. It was nominated for the 2004 MAN Booker Prize. This is the first in a trilogy, and introduces us to two main characters: Gerald Samper and Marta. Gerald is a writer, a ghost writer. He specializes in \u2018autobiographies\u2019 of famous sports stars \u2013 although by the end of the book he does take on a rock star. He has purchased a villa in northern Tuscany that is relatively isolated so that he can concentrate on his writing. According to the estate agent, the nearest house to his is only occupied one month a year by vacationers. Marta (I\u2019m not sure whether I ever caught her last name. No matter.), he soon discovers, is his neighbor. She bought the house next to his for the same reason: solitude, in which she can concentrate on her writing music for film scores. Marta is from Voynovia, a country that was recently a part of the Soviet bloc. She has escaped from her family \u2013 especially her domineering father \u2013 in order to set her spirits free. In Voynovia, women, in particular, daughters, are second-class citizens, and live under the thumbs of their male relatives. She is of an indeterminate age; late 30s (?), and no fashion model. She speaks both a pidgin English and a pidgin Italian. Gerald speaks excellent English, of course, and a passable Italian. He is also a devoted and creative chef. His style is to juxtapose ingredients that are not normally admixed to produce a totally new taste sensation. Many of his recipes are given in the text. As you might have guessed, the two neighbors are immediately like oil and water. The clash of cultures and languages leads to anything but the peace and quiet they were both seeking. These clashes come in the form of riotous situations that will have you laughing as you read along. It is difficult to write a humorous novel, but this author seems to have mastered it completely. Highly recommended.", "A witty & hilarious satire of all the \"A Year in Provence,\" \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" books that romanticize the expat life in Europe. Once again, an overly-refined Brit goes to Italy to follow his writing muse. Please note -- he is a ghostwriter of biographies for celebrities, not a Nobel nominee. That fact does not limit his pretensions whatsoever. Settling into his quaint abode, he is horrified when his new neighbor moves in. Also an expat, she is fleeing her crimelord, overprotective family in Eastern Europe. Now the hijinks begin... a series of wrong conclusions & misunderstandings makes for very funny encounters. The plot brings in some other wryly-drawn characters & Hamilton-Paterson has a gift for language. Footnote -- Fernet Branca is the most vile liqueur I have ever tasted -- Our Writer Hero uses it as the centerpiece for several bizarre recipes of which he is unduly proud.", "After you've read too many lovely, wish-you-were-here travel memoirs & foodie books, Cooking with Fernet Branca is the amusing & biting antidote. I thoroughly enjoyed this parody & it had me literally laughing out loud at times. I'd give it 3.5 stars overall; I'll round it up to 4 stars because it made me laugh out loud when reading at Starbucks.P.S. Don't read this book while eating... for two reasons.1) You may choke on your food from laughing.2) The included 'recipes' are revolting. LOL. Two foreigners, Gerald & Marta, have bought neighboring houses in Italy, each hoping for a beautiful location that's peaceful. Gerald wants to concentrate on his career (ghostwriter of athlete autobiographies) & (heinous) cooking; Marta wants to concentrate on her career as a composer (currently working on a movie soundtrack for a famous Italian director). Both are rather put out to discover each other, since having a neighbor leads to all kinds of interruptions, misread intentions, noise, etc.... Here's a fun quote from early in the book after Gerald went to dinner at neighbor Marta's house:\"Things are looking good. Two days have now gone by since our dinner and nary a squeak out of Marta. I'm counting this as a culinary triumph: the ingenious use of food as an offensive weapon. Garlic ice cream with Fernet Branca may lack subtlety but it is highly effective and I feel that by giving you the recipe I have placed a pacifist's version of Clint Eastwood's famous .44 Magnum in your hands. \"Make my evening, Marta,\" I might have said. And to my amazement she did, taking not one but three massive helpings. If I were a good neighbour I would have dropped in on her by now to make sure she is still alive. But I'm not, so I haven't.\"--------------------I had an hour alone at Starbucks today to start this book. (Ah, lovely!) Within a few minutes, I was sniggering so much that I actually snorted out loud. (This as I was trying so hard to keep my laughing to myself as I sat there alone -- you know, I didn't want to be tagged as the crazy lady at that table over there....) Oh well.... Obviously, so far, so good on this one!", "Whatever else we can say about James Hamilton-Paterson, he is a very funny man. If you ever found yourself in the Italian countryside gazing at the villa next door and wondering who lives there and who, for gosh sakes, is coptering in and out, after reading this novel, you may very well decide you don\u2019t really want to know. It may be entangling, and may, after all, be the end of all you hold dear.Gerald Samper, British biographer to the rich and famous, buys an old villa in need of repair in Tuscany\u2019s Apuan Alps region. He is told, as is his nearby neighbor, that the owner of the nearby villa is rarely in residence so his quest for privacy and solitude is guaranteed. Of course, nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, the resident of the villa he can see from his own is none other than a well-to-do refugee from a Soviet republic, with all her entangling connections.Samper likes cooking, and we are treated to recipes inspired by the abundant local produce, but dreamt up entirely within the convoluted confines of Samper\u2019s own twisted mind: Mussels in Chocolate, say, or Baked Pears in Gorgonzola with Cinnamon Cream, Lampreys in Sherry, Alien Pie, which features smoked cat mixed with baby beets, nasturtium leaves, pureed prunes, and green bacon (what on earth\u2026?), or my personal favorite, Tuna Stuffed with Prunes in Marmite Butter. But Samper deprecates (with good reason) the specialties his neighbor offers him, delicacies delivered direct from the former Soviet republic of Voynovia. As described by Samper:\u201d\u2026brightly colored voynovian objects that were delicate to the same extent that traffic cones are. There were awesome pellets like miniature doughnuts wrapped in candied angelica leaf and injected with chili sauce. Others looked like testicles set in dough. I gathered these were pigeon\u2019s eggs and couldn\u2019t catch her name for them although the phrase that came to me immediately was Christ on a Tricycle. Spearmint eggs?\u201dBut this book is not about cooking, despite the title. It is about living the good life in Tuscany among other artists\u2014writers, musicians, filmmakers, realtors--magicians of all stripes. And what of Fernet Branca? It is a digestif concocted in Italy that, given as a gift to the new arrivals of Le Roccie, is purchased a second time to return the courtesy, and becomes a central feature of the misunderstandings among the residents and visitors there. It is described in Wikipedia as having the flavor of \u201cblack-licorice-flavored Listerine.\""]}
