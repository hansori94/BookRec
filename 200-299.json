{"Sideswipe: A Hoke Moseley Novel": {"average_rating": "4.05", "review": [["This is the third book in Charles Willeford's excellent series featuring Miami homicide detective Hoke Moseley. As the book opens, Hoke, although still only in his forties, wakes up to a full-blown mid-life crisis. He's completely unable to function irrespective of his responsibilities to his two teenage daughters who live with him, to his department, and to his partner, Ellita Sanchez, who is eight months pregnant (not by Hoke) and who also lives in Hoke's home.Unable to cope, Hoke takes a leave of absence from his job and retreats to Singer Island, where his wealthy father lives. He takes a job running a small apartment building for his father and swears that he will never leave the island again.In the meantime, Stanley Sinkiewicz, an elderly retiree who has moved to Florida from Detroit has a brush with the law and, although he is completely innocent, he is briefly forced to share a jail cell with a man claiming to be Robert Smith. \"Smith\" is really a psychopathic career criminal named Troy Louden. He has a gift for reading people and immediately pegs Stanley for the sad, lonely man he is at heart. Louden befriends Stanley, schooling him in the way to best deal with the authorities, and before long, Stanley is convinced that Troy is his new best friend. Louden is desperately hoping to have the charges against him dropped before a fingerprint check is returned and the police discover his real identity. To this end, he asks Stanley to do him a \"small favor\" once he is released, and, totally won over by his new buddy, the old man agrees. The ploy works and Louden, now free, enlists Stanley to help him pull off a big job he is planning.Meanwhile, Hoke Mosley is discovering that it's a lot harder to simplify his life than he had hoped. His father is determined to help him get a new job with the local police force, although Hoke has absolutely no interest in the job. His younger daughter joins him on the island further complicating matters, and the tenants in the apartment house generally prove to be a major pain in the butt.The Mosley story and the Stanley/Louden story proceed along parallel tracks and for a while the reader is left to wonder how Willeford is ever going to link them up. But it really doesn't matter because both stories are very entertaining.Willeford has populated this book with a number of unique and very interesting characters and between the lines, he has a great deal to say about the nature of family and about the workings of the capitalist system in the United States. All in all, it's a very entertaining book that should appeal to large numbers of readers."], ["Hoke Moseley truly is a one of a kind protagonist and Sideswipe is his most uniquely Willefordian case yet. A detective novel where the crime occurs in the last chapter, that alternates between the plotting of a heist and the workings of a policeman are not exactly rare you might say but in the hands of Charles Willeford this generic plot takes on a whole new life.Instead of intricate details of who goes where and when, a recce of the bank in question and potential getaway routes led by a criminal mastermind we are treated to the chess like machinations of a criminal psychopath as seen through the eyes of a clueless Florida retiree.And anybody who's picked up a Hoke Moseley novel will happily tell you that Hoke is no hero cop, no genius detective, no gumshoe with keen insight in to the criminal mind, Hoke is a middle aged man without any teeth currently going through a midlife crisis as he faces up to living with his two teenaged daughters and his former detective partner currently eight months pregnant, all the while being inundated with mind numbing desk work.The majority of the novel then is NOT your typical pulp crime shenanigans; it is a treatise on how two men are lost in an America changing beyond their recognition or their abilities to cope, there's an affecting look at how family can mean many different things to different people and can be made up of many different people not just those you are born to, and yet Hoke is still a decent cop who does some solid work when not wearing yellow jumpsuits and moonlighting as an apartment manager to avoid responsibilities.The invention of Stanley the retired automotive worker is a particular high point for me, the poor clueless guy who just wants to find a place for himself in society with what's left of his life has a true innocence to the way he sees the world and the way he is introduced to the reader is the work of a genius. Willeford twists and turns the reader around in that opening chapter until it ends with a full on \"holy fuck, did that really just happen?!\" moment. Willeford was a prolific and much respected author but this has to be right up there with his finest moments, and probably the finest moments ever captured in crime fiction."], ["The Hoke Moseley novels are about a detective, but they are not novels in the detective genre. Charles Willeford never dangles any clues or misdirection in front of the readers, and the actual crime that needs to be solved doesn't happen until the tail end of the book. Instead, he holds the readers interest with remarkably vivid portraits of his characters, various locales in Miami area and of course the themes he brings up (How easily decent (but gullable) people can sometimes be turned to crime, the american dream, sub-urban life, modern art, mid-life crisis, public education, etc.). Charles keeps a swift pace and never lingers on any one particular issue, always rewarding the readers with more interesting tid-bits to chew on, but admittedly, readers accustomed to more formulaic crime novels will be left in the cold (not only does the crime only happen at the end of the book, but for the majority of the novel Hoke is on leave from the force and very intent on never coming back). This novel challenges the conventions of the set formulas and challenges the reader (if only so slightly), but hey, I would expect nothing less from a literary-genre novel."], ["The description on the back of the jacket begins with the line, \u201cThere comes a time in every detective's life when he's had enough.\u201d After reading that, and not knowing anything about the character, Hoke Mosely, you might assume this story was about a law and order man pushed to the edge of sanity by the degenerate dredges of society, akin to a right-wing revenge fantasy like Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry or Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey in Death Wish. You\u2019d be wrong, kind of, but you\u2019d also be pleasantly surprised.What pushes Hoke Mosley to the edge isn\u2019t so much the scum of the earth committing senseless acts of depravity\u2014although there\u2019s plenty of this; Willeford is delightfully unafraid of being politically incorrect in his depictions of police life\u2014but more mundane, everyday problems: a teenage daughter who wants to drop out of high school, another daughter who develops an eating disorder, busywork at the office, financial strife, and a pregnant roommate/coworker who eats her eggs in the most excruciating way possible. All this leads Hoke to a nervous breakdown that takes him out of Miami and back to the sleepy rural Florida vacation community he grew up in, charged with only the mundane tasks of maintaining his father\u2019s hotel in an effort to \u201csimplify his life.\u201dMeanwhile, adopting the same parallel narrative structure from Miami Blues, Willeford introduces us to Stanley, a retired auto-worker who disowns his family after they fail to rush to his aid when he\u2019s falsely accused of molesting a child, and Troy, a self-described psychopath who enlists Stanley\u2019s aid to get out of prison and later recruits Stanley for his gang/family (Troy also admits to being an admirer of Charles Manson), along with a struggling Barbadian painter, and an emotionally damaged and physically deformed stripper.The middle of the story dragged a little, and at first the premise of Hoke having a nervous breakdown seemed a little forced, but by the time you reach the climax, almost everything seems to come together brilliantly. Willeford has a gift for using minute but bizarre details to either set up jaw-dropping plot twists or hilarious diatribes that seem to stem from his own cynical grievances. Without giving too much away, the robbery gone awry\u2014again an element repeated from Miami Blues\u2014is one of the best, and most brutal chapters of crime fiction I\u2019ve ever read. It might be his personal history as a decorated combat veteran, but the man knows how to write a gruesome gunshot wound.What I didn\u2019t like: If there\u2019s one criticism I have, it\u2019s that he writes pretty weak female and minority characters. A reoccurring theme between this book and Miami Blues is whores who are good at housework, weak-willed and irrational, they sit around being told what to do by a man who abuses and exploits them, although this could be Willeford commenting on the degrading effects on the psyche of life in the sex industry. Or he could just be a misogynist.What I did like: The parallels. He jokes about this with a throwaway line in the last chapter, but I really enjoyed the way Willeford juxtaposes events in Stanley\u2019s/Troy\u2019s timeline with events in Hoke\u2019s. He emulates but differentiates the climax and the ending of this book from the ending and climax of Miami Blues. Ellita, Hoke\u2019s partner, attempts to apprehend Troy by the book, firing a warning shot when she attempts to apprehend him, and she\u2019s punished for this, but when Hoke encounters Junior at the end of Miami Blues, he takes the law into his own hands, executing him coldly and deliberately. At the beginning of the book as Hoke\u2019s family falls apart, Troy\u2019s family assembles, and at the end of the book as Hoke\u2019s family rejoins in resolution, Troy\u2019s family disperses in bloody carnage. We\u2019re left not entirely sure if Troy really wanted to live happily ever after at The Hotel Oluffsson (I\u2019ve been there!) with his family/gang, or if he merely snapped when a seemingly routine robbery went haywire due to mundane details overlooked, thus serving as a callback to the inciting incident of Hoke\u2019s nervous breakdown."], ["Such sadness. I have only one more Hoke Moseley book to go. The late and great Charles Willeford passed away after 4 of this series, leaving behind a magnificent legacy. His genius lies in the minutiae of his character's development. In the Hoke Moseley series, he employs the brilliant technique of alternating each chapter between the daily lives of Hoke and his immediate family and colleagues and the villains as they plan their crime. As such, the crimes don't actually occur until late in each novel finishing with explosive endings.So far, this is the best of the series, even better than the first, Miami Blues. It is so great to read of Miami in the 1980s without the pastel-cladded shallowness depicted in Miami Vice :)His characters are the down outs, the losers, the never weres and are written is such a beautiful matter of fact way, I can see why guys like Elmore Leonard and James Lee Burke cited him as such a major influence. His work spanned 40+ plus years and, for mine, his novel Pick-Up is the ultimate masterpiece of \"nihilist-noir\"."], ["I almost felt like I was reading a crime fiction novel written by Raymond Carver. Melancholic crime fiction?. I don't know if SIDESWIPE can be classified as a crime fiction novel. After Willeford achieved success with MIAMI BLUES, he really cranked it up a few notches, wrote the novels that he wanted to write. Hoke Moseley is the exact opposite of a tough cop. He seems to be resigned to his fate, stops talking to his police partner and daughter and moves back in with his father who gives him a job managing a vacation resort sort of place. But Moseley springs into action when a suave, smooth talking barbarian carries out violent robberies of department stores. The character of the barbarian is described from the point of view of an aging middle class drone who finances his most ambitious operation (mostly to find some kind of excitement in what has been a dull life). So we are not really sure if his narrative is completely reliable. The best Charles Willeford novel I have read so far."], ["I'm not sure what's going on, but I think I've started to develop a little crush on Hoke Moseley. I know, right? I mean, he pees his pants within the first ten pages of this book. But I feel such a strong affection toward him for some reason.The structure of this book is more similar to Miami Blues in that every other chapter is about Hoke, and the odd ones deal with another storyline about a criminal sociopath (Troy) who isn't Junior, but might as well be. I completely loved the way it all came together at the end. It's shitballs crazy awesome. And I love how even though throughout the plots of these books Hoke's life is fairly shitty, at the end he gets a nice little pick me up and you're ready to move on thinking the old guy is going to be okay.My favorite thing about Willeford is the little details. The fact that Hoke tries to cheat at Monopoly. His recipe for beef stew. I love it all."], ["Ballsy. Possibly one of the stranger detective novels I've read. The detective is essentially on break (midlife crisis) and we spend most of the book waiting for the damn crime to be committed!!! Half of the book follows Moseley trying to simplify his life (with amusing results) and heart-warmingly dealing with his youngest teenaged daughter. The other half follows Stanley, a sad-hack retiree who poisons dogs, and Troy, a criminal psychopath who brings together a \"family\" to pull off a heist. What kept me laughing were the off-beat portraits and deadpan observations/statements - Professor Itai and his lamenting of the lack of intact Ethiopian horsefly specimens, Hoke advising his father that fruit was a better gift than flowers for his bulimic daughter, Stanley Junior having to sit in a cardboard shithouse during staff meetings because he wasn't performing."], ["The character of Stanley Sinciewicz, and what happens to him, is the best part."], ["Imagine this: adding Grape-Nuts to a sieve so you can run hot water to soften them up so you can eat them without putting in your false teeth; then gumming them at the dining room table while reading the sports section. Hoke, a homicide investigator lives with his partner Ellita who has the unbearable habit of letting the egg yolks run through her teeth. Ellita, who is pregnant, helps with the rent and the care of Hoke two teenage daughters.Shades of Ed McBain, the writing, I mean. Hoke gets fed up with trying to solve an interminable number of cold cases that seem to be forever piling up on his desk. He retreats into a catatonic state, finally decides to chuck it all, and leaves for his father's place on Riviera Beach. He has decided he wants the simple life. Right. We all know there is no such thing, and soon his bulimic daughter (recognized as such only by a neighbor) comes to visit (she gets shipped off to his ex,) he's having to deal with the myriad problems as manager of his father's apartment building (he gets free rent in one of the apartments) and Ellita calls for help in dealing with her mother's thoughts on amniocentisis.A side plot (never fear, the two will intersect) involves a retired Ford employee falsely accused of molesting his neighbor's daughter, a problem that's soon rectified but not before Stanley meets Troy in jail who has a scheme to make lots of money, also involving a painter and a former stripper whose face was mutilated by her boss. Enough of the plot. You can find that elsewhere. Hoke soon realizes that the simple life is effervescent. First rate story and writing by a master. Mislabeled as a thriller, though, unless impending disaster provides you with the sense of thrill. An engrossing, very enjoyable story. If you like McBain, Moseley, Leonard, et al, you'll very much like Williford."]], "review_count": "58", "description": "Hoke Moseley has had enough.

But on the street, career criminal Troy Louden is hatching plans of his own with a gang including a disfigured hooker, a talentless artist, and a clueless retiree.

I\u2019m not sure how this novel and I slipped past each other in my youth. I\u2019m guessing that since the main character was a girl I wasn\u2019t that interested in middle school and when I grew older the science fiction elements didn\u2019t appear strong enough to snag my interest. Oh well. Last weekend I bought A Wrinkle in Time at a Borders near the Seattle airport. I wanted the novel to get me through the grueling twelve hour journey (whoo, flight delays and pre-dawn connecting flights!) home, and I thank Ms. L\u2019Engle for the perfect story for early hour near-hallucinatory reading in the middle of the Minneapolis International promenade.What makes this book so good? First off, A Wrinkle in Time works under the assumption that kids are smart enough either to grasp the nuances of some fairly deep physics or, if they don\u2019t get every detail, they\u2019ll flow with the storyline anyway. One woman I know said, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand all the science when I was a kid but I still loved it.\u201d That makes sense to me. Hell, I didn\u2019t understand all the science now, and I\u2019m (supposedly) a grown-up. L\u2019Engle doesn\u2019t just say, \u201cAnd then they traveled time.\u201d She tries to explain how time travel might work.  I wonder if so many kids, especially girls, liked this novel because they felt L\u2019Engle respected them as intelligent readers.Second, A Wrinkle in Time frames Meg\u2019s personality as multi-faceted and more complex than just about any I\u2019ve encountered in YA literature. In fact, reading this novel I couldn\u2019t help but consider her a template on which some more modern coming-of-age characters (think Harry Potter) were modeled. She\u2019s brave but doubts her own strength in an tangible, authentic manner. And her relationship with Calvin is sweet without getting all High School Musical. Third, the evil in this novel is damn scary and the darkness pure and substantial. We\u2019re talking elemental, unadulterated evil that manifests itself in the fear and conformity of those who break down in its presence. And the characters\u2019 encounters with this evil feel real. The climatic scenes are perhaps slightly too swift but the nuances of the battle fit well with a remarkably philosophical (and Christian, but in a positive way) resolution of good and evil\u2019s conflict. If my friends\u2019 reviews are any indication a lot of smart girls who turned into strong, intelligent women grew up under the spell of A Wrinkle in Time. I feel like I know them a little better after reading this novel, and I can see them all, around age ten, turning the book\u2019s pages in their rooms, feeling their own strength and potential. And that\u2019s damn cool, really, don\u2019t you think, a whole generation of girls reading A Wrinkle in Time? Maybe little girls across America are googling \u201ctesseract\u201d as we speak\u2026"], ["First, understand that I am editing this review after several outraged responses. I knew that \"Wrinkle\" was considered to be a classic, but I was unaware that it was considered a Beloved Classic Beyond Criticism. I read this in grade school and just REread it aloud, to my daughter. I didn't have a clear memory of it, though I remember that I loved the way it started. Now I realize why I forgot so much of it. I STILL love the first 3 chapters, and dislike the rest. But since some of you found (and WILL find, I'm sure) my review to be judgmental, harsh and undiplomatic (a review IS a critique, right?) to the point of insulting, I thought I'd do a little research, look over the book again, think about it some more. So I've edited this review. But I find I just can't retract my statements. They are my opinion, that's all, and I haven't changed my mind. I can only try to be open minded, be honest, and try to explain my thoughts & feelings more clearly. Otherwise, I'd be a simpering fake.Like C.S. Lewis books (especially the last of his Chronicles of Narnia, The Last Battle), A Wrinkle In Time has strong, (heavy-handed, I think), overtones of Christian doctrine. I'm not anti-spiritual, but I have a personal discomfort with this kind of religious doctrine. (You many not, and that's fine.) But more than that issue, the book is an odd combination of intelligent hard science, interesting quantum science that is brushed over, and quotes from the bible. At least there are a few respectful mentions of other spiritual leaders from other cultures, and moral messages from classic literature and philosophers. I understand this combination garnered criticism from both religious fundamentalists as well as atheists and secular society. L'Engle has earned my respect for taking on the difficult and controversial marriage of science and religion. She has also earned my criticism for raising this issue and then failing to really grapple with it. It's treated lightly, as though it's a natural thing that should be easy to accept, in spite of the many holes and inconsistencies in her story. I wouldn't even mind, except that this book takes itself SO seriously! It's easy to imagine that a school teacher might use this book to demonstrate that Evolutionist Theory and Creationism can be combined, but I find science and religion to have a disjointed and uneasy coexistence in this book. One is always dropped abruptly for the other. Or at least, it seems so to me. Ok. Now that I have tackled that big one, let's move on. I found the characters rather flat, (the genius child, the misfit girl, the beautiful, genius, scientist mother who nonetheless stays home and cooks stew in bunsen burners while her husband has adventures). The story itself is made up of vague scenarios of conflict of the psyche and spirit, with the entire Universe at stake. L'Engle's metaphors are obvious and their manifestations flat. [SPOILER ALERT] There is a quest to fight a \"Darkness\" (oooh!) that wants to rid us all of individuality & free will. There are 3 beings who used to be stars before they died in the fight with the \"Darkness\" and became something beyond our comprehension. They can appear in any form to us, so that we have some way of processing their existence. They are, in fact, so beyond anything knowable that I can't feel much for them or say much about them, except that they make a convenient plot device for transporting the characters throughout the Universe and the story. Anyway, the \"Darkness\" takes over a planet which turns into a kind of sci-fi beehive, with brainwashed automatons. I found the planet to be delightfully creepy and would have liked to know more about it, (even if it seems suspiciously like a thinly veiled anti-communist warning message.) So guess what's doing the brainwashing? - a giant, evil, disembodied brain, called IT, who is personally responsible for spreading the Darkness across the Universe. Really? A brain? Doesn't anyone else find this simplistic and cliche? The main character defeats this brain by gushing love. I am quite sure that many, many readers were moved to tears by Meg's gushing, but I do not happen to be that kind of person. Before Meg realizes that she has the power to gush love, the crusaders tesser through time and space (no explanation of how the father can do this) to a fascinating planet with very interesting aliens who can't see, but have other senses. I'd have loved to know more about their society and these mysterious other senses, but again, these ideas aren't very developed.These are the things in this book, and in L'Engle's writing that I love: As I mentioned, I love her courage in at least attempting a controversial issue like mixing science and spirituality. I love that this book has the heart to recognize love as the greatest power, and that it has the wisdom to recognize fear as one of the biggest weapons. I love that individuality prevails, and the romantic in me approves of the loving, whole family. I love that she has enough respect for children that she included difficult vocabulary and a few difficult concepts. Many children are far more capable of handling complex ideas than we give them credit for, especially if we expose them to these things early on. I love that L'Engle doesn't underestimate them in this way, at least initially, on the surface. Since my biggest problems with this book all involve my finding it simplistic, naive, and certain parts of it cliche & obvious, I wonder if I need to remind myself that it's meant for children. Perhaps children should be idealistic, or even naive, in the way that this book is. But then I wonder if that is another way of underestimating them. ESPECIALLY since I felt exactly the same way when I read this book as a child!Wind In The Willows makes me feel closer to God, or a creative power (though there's some gushing in there too, at the end.) The Jungle Book explores social constructs and morals, more deeply and naturally, for me. A Sound Of Thunder blew my mind, in grade school, with its \"butterfly effect\" theory of the power and responsibility of each individual. All of these are childrens' books, though they span generations, and time and space, more gracefully than tessering did for me. I could name so many more. But, if A Wrinkle In Time opened your mind to new ideas, (instead of making you feel frustrated by light treatment of them), made you question some latent prejudice, (instead of feeling bored by obvious metaphors), lifted your spirits & made you cheer for bookish outcasts, (instead of feeling that no one is that one-dimensional) or cry for the love of a big sister & little brother, (instead of cringing when a version of \"I love you Charles Wallace\" appears 19 times in 2 pages), then it is a wonderful book. For you."], ["3.5*What a fun weird little story!"], ["3.5/5"], ["Am I the first living 64 year old who had never read this book- until now - March, 2017. that is? Random Thoughts .........I was surprised to discover this story was about a little GIRL --not a WIZARD. .....I was more surprised that Meg, 13 years old, had three other siblings... two twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys, and a younger brother, Charles Wallace Murray, who is a child prodigy.....with parents who were scientist. THERE IS A REAL FAMILY -WITH REAL PEOPLE in this book! NOT SURE WHY THIS SURPRISED ME! .....I'm thinking \"HOT DAMN, I might like this story\".... and my daughters might have.... but as far as I know .... they missed reading this one too. Heck, the first page was 'great' - the first sentence was 'classic-great': \"It was a dark and stormy night\". What child doesn't perk up to hear a story with those first words? So....I continue reading 'remembering' that not long ago 'ELLIE' praised this book SO HIGHLY ....as her FAVORITE children's book ( she and I both have passion for the Velveteen Rabbit)....that I KNEW I HAD TO FINALLY READ IT. I bought a used copy at my recycle bookstore for a dollar. THANK YOU ELLIE!!!!! :) whew...I'm glad I didn't miss this gem!!! I loved the characteristics of the kids and adults....each unique in their own ways. .....What creative names for characters: Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Witch.... 'charming supernatural neighbors'. .....as well as the lovely Aunt Beast. The three *W* women escort Meg, Charles, and another boy, Calvin O'Keefe. from Meg's school --through the universe by means of SCI FI UNIVERSE TRANSPORTATION-- \"tesseract\" - A fifth dimensional phenomenon-- ET hasn't phoned home yet.....on a mission to rescue Meg and Charles father. Meg, and the Mrs. W's all agree that the mysterious disappearance of the father is very strange and has something to do with the term \"tesseract\". After all he is a scientist and was working on a project before his disappearance. The Trio W-women and children travel through the universe and visit different planets - a utopian world- with creatures disguised as humans. First they bump into evil... then they are taken to a woman to look through a crystal ball. The children are learning that there is both evil and good in the world. They see much darkness through that crystal ball down here on planet earth. They also see that artist's, and philosophers, and religious folks are fighting against the evil. AT THIS POINT IF I WERE A CHILD - I WOULD HAVE QUESTIONS -- THE CHILD ME WOULD ASK: \"well, my daddy died--[I was 4]. I'd want to know if he left me because he got tired of all the fighting on earth--and since I've always wondered since the day he died -- not knowing what the hell that meant -- if he was coming back soon --- and could I go on the mission with Meg and bring my daddy back home too?\" This book might have scared me as a child -- I would have needed a tender adult reading it with me. ON WITH THIS STORY: They soon travel to a planet called Camazotz.... where they find Meg's father: trapped! The planet is being controlled by an evil brain and with powerful telepathic abilities- called \"IT\". This story begins to gets MORE SCARY..... I would have been on the edge of my seat. Note: I don't read much science fiction - but the children are threatened by the possibility of their minds being controlled through a telepathic takeover. Whew..... laughing ....I was exhausted by the end.....OF COURSE IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING.... I HATE that felt like crying in this children's book! I hate all you people who told me it's a must read .....because for this girl it WAS!!!!!! I LOVED IT!!! - you mean people!!! I love believing there is GOOD in the world .. so why am I sad? A special appreciation to the Goodreads community-- I might never have read this book without all the the LOVE & EXPRESSION for this children's classic! Thank you!"], ["The story takes about 100 pages of tedious, banal dialogue, to get to the point where you are told that this is a battle against Evil, and all you need is love. But everything is so oversimplified, so sketchy--everything is reduced to big words, like IT, and evil. This IT, also called the Dark Thing, is striving to create a communist-type society where everyone conforms, down to the little children who bounce their balls in uniform rhythms and who live in cutter-box houses. I liked Meg in the beginning, she was a believable character, filled with her own problems, and I really wanted for things to work out for her. But when she went on her journey, and especially since she got to that dreadful communist planet, she got hysterical. She did not \u201csay\u201d anything for half of the book--she yelled, gasped, screamed, cried, etc. She got ticked off at everyone for everything.Then there might have been an indication that Charles Wallace was going to be a player, but he fizzled. There are constant references to him being special, but we never find out what was so special about him, besides putting a 30 year old into a 4 year old body and calling it \u201cgenius\u201d. There was all this build-up for the confrontation between him and IT, but nothing happened. He looked at the guy, let him in, and became filled with ideas from Lenin himself.Then there are worlds. These characters traveled to a planet that was described in three lines with beautiful flowers and a tall mountain. Then another planet is not described at all except to say that it was a winter wonderland type of a place. The residence of the Happy Medium was another planet where they were conveniently in a cave, and final stop was in a planet that was probably like Earth, except all we know about it is that it had rows of houses and tall buildings. There you have it--traveled all through the known Universe and have nothing to show for it. No imagination to describe and develop a world.Then there are bizarre references to god/s that come out of nowhere, or in the oddest places, and disappear into nowhere. Characters are underdeveloped; scenes are not finished; worlds are left to themselves; theme is the fear of religious right of the communist left.It's a caricature of evil, done perhaps in the belief that kids won't get it otherwise. There's not much in terms of a plot, the worlds described are paper-thin, and it shows no historical understanding, no outside knowledge.More of Purplycookie\u2019s Reviews @:  http://www.goodreads.com/purplycookie Book Details: Title A Wrinkle in Time (Time #1)Author Madeleine L'EngleReviewed By Purplycookie"], ["Thirteen-year-old Meg Murry\u2019s house is visited, on a \u201cdark and stormy night\u201d by a mysterious stranger named Mrs. Whatsit who says, \u201cSpeaking of ways, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.\u201d Tesseract refers to confidential scientific work Meg\u2019s father conducted for the government before he went missing several years prior. On the following day, Meg accompanies her little brother to Mrs. Whatsit\u2019s house and finds herself unexpectedly swept away on an intergalactic adventure with hope of being reunited with her father. Reaching for A Wrinkle in Time lends itself to high expectations. L\u2019Engle\u2019s book won the Newbery Medal in 1963, has been adapted to film more than once, and is heralded by many \u2013 young and old alike \u2013 as a longstanding favorite. But, as a first-time reader diving in with expectations fanned by the flames of so much praise, disappointment, it seems, was inevitable. To be fair, several aspects of L\u2019Engle\u2019s distinguished novel are pleasing. It opens with atmospheric writing that later gives way to fanciful descriptions. In a commendably daring act, L\u2019Engle puts forth a female protagonist at a time \u2013 and in a genre \u2013 where female protagonists were not readily accepted. Better still, young Meg is awkward and unattractive. Her looks having been traded for smarts \u2013 particularly in mathematics (an intelligence that likely trickles down from her scientist father and mother). It\u2019s easy to discern the value in L\u2019Engle\u2019s efforts to introduce young readers to complex scientific theories. Yes, she makes them easy to understand, but she also avoids the mistake of thinking too little of her young audience, holding firm in her belief that the fluidity of a child\u2019s imagination allows them to grasp concepts that would baffle most adults. Above all else, the fundamental messages of A Wrinkle in Time are lovely: light must battle dark to keep it at bay; moments of sorrow are what sweeten happiness; individuality and free will are priceless; and love is power. But . . . Meg is an irritating protagonist. She\u2019s prone to fits and over-reacting. When she\u2019s not shrieking or screaming, she\u2019s confused or complaining. The decision to go on an adventure isn\u2019t Meg\u2019s. It\u2019s her younger brother, Charles Wallace, that declares they will depart, and Meg is merely whisked along, screaming and clutching to Calvin O\u2019Keefe (one of the most popular boys in school) along the way. As empowered female protagonists go, Meg doesn\u2019t show her true colors until the end of the book. With all due respect to Ms. L\u2019Engle, her religious convictions saturate the story. Despite exploring scientific theories and naming several artists and scientists, L\u2019Engle\u2019s religion remains front and center throughout the book. The result is a title that seems better suited for a categorization in Christian fiction. Any doubt of this is dashed away by L\u2019Engle\u2019s proclamation during her Newbery Medal acceptance speech that, \u201cIn the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth . . . The extraordinary, the marvelous thing about [the book of] Genesis is not how unscientific it is, but how amazingly accurate it is.\u201d Is it a mark against A Wrinkle in Time that Christian themes pervade the book? Certainly not! But is there any indication going in that a religious doctrine dictates this children\u2019s book? None whatsoever. Finally, as plot pacing goes, A Wrinkle in Time leaves much to be desired. Halfway through the book, little has happened. The second half is slightly less uneventful, but the final chapters feel rushed and the neat-and-tidy conclusion is far too convenient. Though it\u2019s easy to appreciate the bold strides L\u2019Engle took as an author and the merit of her contribution to children\u2019s literature, A Wrinkle in Time\u2019s appeal seems to have gotten lost in the folds of time."], ["I have one general, self-imposed rule about reviewing on this site: I write about the books I've read in the order I've finished them. By that logic, I should be cobbling together my reaction to Hunger right now but I am so taken by this childhood staple that there's no room in my brain for anything other than uncontrollable glee over this book that another Madeleine has given to the world. I never read this book as a kid. I didn't read it as a teenager or a college student. I read it for the first time with 30 coming at me like a crazed stalker who won't let a pesky thing like a restraining order stand in the way. And that did concern me, especially after half-heartedly slogging through the first four books comprising the Narnia Chronicles a few years ago before taking an indefinite break from tackling what should have been another enthusiastically remembered staple of a young reader's diet. I was afraid that I'd completely missed out on enjoying A Wrinkle in Time, a novel that I have heard praised up and down by so many people as the prime example of how good children's literature can be. So I read it like I read as a wee lass who didn't realize that she was poised at the very beginning of what would become a lifelong pursuit of books fueled by an insatiable need to keep reading. I read well past my bedtime with one tiny light illuminating the path to somewhere magically transportive, knowing full well that the bookworm gratification far outweighed the inevitability of being a zombie all morning. I read it when I should have been doing something else as dictated by responsibility. I read to be told a story and to consider ideas I'd never come across in the world beyond two covers, sure, but mostly I read to give myself up to a writer's lush landscape, to lose myself in someone else's words. I read it to let my imagination run free through a universe I fervently and fruitlessly wished to be a part of. And my adult self was just as enchanted as my inner child was. Sure, A Wrinkle in Time has its faults but I honestly couldn't tell you what they are because I was so thoroughly entertained, so taken with these characters I couldn't believe I could relate to in a way that was far less remote and removed than I expected (which is to say, at all) that all the things my nitpicky, pretentious post-English-major self would usually hone in on paled in comparison to the sheer enjoyment of the rush of letting a book completely suck me into its world to the point where the real world could have collapsed around me and I wouldn't've either cared or noticed because I was so wrapped up in this story.On one hand, yeah, I do feel a little cheated that so much of what I needed to hear as a kid has lived within these pages all this time and I could have had such imperatives by my side to ease the pains of childhood's harsh but necessary learning experiences had I just shown even a fraction of some interest in this book. Among them: One's parents are not infallible. Weaknesses can become strengths -- nay, tools integral to besting some truly harrowing obstacles -- in the right circumstances. That sometimes you have to face down scary or unpleasant truths, and you're not excused from looking away or backing down just because the task ahead is either scary or unpleasant. It's better to embrace your individuality and not compromise yourself, no matter how uncomfortable you are in your own skin, than to mindlessly submit to the herd mentality and easy conformity. Just because something appears strange doesn't make it bad -- or all that strange at its core, after all. What things are is infinitely more important than what they look like. But conversely? This book drenched my ordinary existence with fantasy's magic for a few days, and I'm sure it'll stick with me in the days to come. My first encounter with this book wasn't a foggily but fondly recalled childhood memory that's destined to be tarnished by the darkening cynicism of the years upon revisits from my older self. I got to experience the breathless wonder of a kid discovering an instant favorite for that very first time as an oasis of sheer escapist rapture in the face of a few intense work days and the humdrum nature of routine adulthood. And it proved to me that I don't always have to be such a goddamn snob about kid lit because when it's good, it is extraordinary. (And, really, let's be honest: Younger Me wasn't exactly the sharpest crayon in the tool shed, so who's to say I would have picked up on the more subtle elements that made this such a delightful read, anyway?)Despite my natural inclination toward hyperbole, I am not exaggerating when I say I'm a little better for having read this book, one that I initially arrived at out of dubious curiosity and left in a state of giddy, childlike awe. And maybe a few tears."], ["[Later note: Had discussion with author about this book and why it means so much to so many people\u2014specifically women. Also read excellent NYTimes piece about the fiftieth anniversary. Some books are powerful for their readers because of their context; in this case, the utter lack in popular kid's literature of 1962 of characters like Meg\u2014real girls, who cared about atypical subjects like math, who were unashamed to be other than pink-wearing cheerleaders. To find a powerful role model in a novel must be a wonderful thing, especially for bookish girls. And maybe it makes sense that as a boy in the seventies, I missed that entirely. Still, rereading as an adult, I found it unbearably heavy-handed. Hence the two star rating: It was okay.]One of those overrated books the response to which defies explanation. Clunky, heavy-handed, and as obvious in its way as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

He is pretty much your typical Willeford character and nothing that he does really surprises you in that sense. I spotted some similarities with some of the Chester Himes Harlem Cycle novels I've read and rather more interestingly Springer's desire to live as easily as possible called to mind Robert Heinlein's famous character Lazarus Long who inadvertently worked harder than he ever would have in trying to do as little as possible in every task he was ever assigned.It's a hardboiled little tale of greed, lust and deception that provides the reader with existential questions without putting the thoughts in the head of the protagonist, pure 50s pulp gold, and it even has interracial relations and violence to boot."], ["A lot of Willeford fans like this one but I thought it was crap.

It flirts with many ideas but ultimately abandons almost all of them. Was that intentional? * Was the book trying to make a point? I often felt it was trying to comment on race-relations, but the stance the novel takes ended up indifferent. * Surprisingly light on violence, but that's a good thing here - When the violence comes, it has a certain impact because of it's scarcity. * Great pacing in the last 2/3rds.* What is it with this genre and the trope of a gorgeous woman who want to screw the protagonist as soon as they meet?* It was entertaining as hell.* It doesn't belong in the Noir Hall of Fame (is that a thing? That should be a thing.) but it's a good and quick read for anyone who likes the genre, or generally pulpy fiction from the middle of the 20th century.* Why in the blue hell doesn't Hard Case Crime reprint Willeford? It seems like a no-brainer. * Speaking of which, t's a shame that it's so hard to find a decent copy of this book. I read the edition published by blackmask.com which no longer exists. It boasts a plain, ugly black cover with the original cover art in a very small square amid the darkness. On the bright side, Wits-End books has came out with a (kind of pricey) edition under the title  The Black Mass of Brother Springer.  I haven't seen it in person, but it's probably your best bet if you want a physical copy. * My eyes burn. I'm tired. It's 4 AM.

Too soon, he becomes the focus of Klan activity, a lot of donation money, and a parishioner's wife. He arrived at this impasse of identity because in his respectable life he faced:\"My monthly payment of $78.60 on my house was five days overdue. My car payment on my three-year-old Pontiac was one month overdue. A small payment, only $42.50 per month, to be sure....

It's amazing how it sprang into life from the first page and took me back to that state of amazement I felt the first time I read it. I was especially moved by the introduction from Donald Westlake, which is not in the earlier editions. Westlake really nails it. Willeford earned the ultimate reward--honor and respect from the best-selling writers in the noir genre.In 1958, when this book was published, Willeford was a struggling pulp fiction writer. Although he published several remarkable books during this period, none of them were big sellers, although they were critically acclaimed. He kept on writing anyway, while paying the bills by teaching writing at Miami Dade College and the University of Miami. Willeford finally hit it big in the 1980's with the Hoke Moseley novels, the first of which (Miami Blues) was made into a damn good film. At that point, he was 61 years old. He wrote three more Moseley novels, all classics, and then he left us. If you are a true Willeford freak, you have to go back and read his pulp classics from the 50's through the 70's. Every single one of them is a gem.Sometimes I feel like screaming to the world, \"If you haven't read Willeford, you're not qualified to discuss postmodern American literature!\""], ["Willeford creates a vivid story in a few amount of words. This is more of a novella, or a long short story, than a book. But it's very engaging and engrossing. It's only 192 pages, but the characters are interesting, and the story keeps you on your toes. The main character, known throughout most of the book, is the Right Reverend Deuteronomy Springer, and he essentially has no redeeming qualities about him. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is that it's a but dated, as it was published in 1958, and you can tell it was written very much in the moment. I enjoyed seeing things like the cheapest meal at a 5-star restaurant costing $4.35, but it was slightly distracting. That doesn't really make sense, because I wouldn't criticize a Laura Ingalls Wilder book for saying that 5 cents was a lot of money to spend on a slate, but there was still something weird about it that I can't quite put my finger on. All in all, it's an interesting book, and I would definitely recommend it for fun reading, especially like on the beach."], ["Originally published as \"The Black Mass of Brother Springer\" and with original 1960s cover art that looks eerily like George W.

Without directly contradicting herself, she constantly inclines her characters away from obvious resolution: of the four, it's the only one that we actually know to be convalescing who seems least trapped by the place, who retains the most connection to the outside world, and the least to the others. On the other hand, it's the only character that we actually get to see arrive from the outside, not a patient or guest, that is referred to by the others as insane. And like sleep-walkers, they spiral around and around eachother, under the sun and sound of the tennis courts, on the edge of the wood that none quite seem able to enter or pass through.There's also a film, Duras' own directorial debut, that echoes and subtly modifies the original. They're very true to eachother though, reflected images. They both feel, to me, like this:\n(It's a poster I drew for a a screening at the Spectacle this month, April 2014. Check it out if you're in New York, it plays twice more.)"], ["A couple years ago I was living in a basement suite, a bachelor pad, a single room with a half wall that divided the kitchen from the living and sleeping room and then a full wall that separated the kitchen from the bathroom, which was given the dignity of having its own door. It was a good place to live, despite its size and the lack of light, and in spite of the settling airs which held back escaping smells of the kitchen. I avoided making curries. In the kitchen were my four bookshelves, full and beautiful, displaying a wealth of adventures. I read a lot; I should have read more.It was in that space, on an old chair, the only one I had, that I discovered Marguerite Duras in The Lover. I think most people come to Duras through The Lover. I wrote a review of that book which, if you are interested, you can read here . I liked it without being astonished by it; I thought it had a good deal more to say, I thought I needed to read it again when I had a bit more maturity. I wonder if now I have a bit more maturity. After all, here I am, no longer living alone but instead loafing around in my parents\u2019 house, in my old bedroom, looking for jobs in another city, hoping the right thing will pop up so that I can go and not be here. Surely I have matured. But I ask about my impending maturity as it develops because this book, Destroy, She Said, has made it clear to me that Duras knows what she is doing, and is far better at it, far more intricate, far more precise, than I appreciated back then in that chair hidden away from the sun.Now I do not think that I know what Destroy, She Said is about. I might even understand it less after having read the collection of interview shambles that were included at the back of the novella. But I think I have a sense of something that it was, something that it was trying to be, something that it succeeded at with all of its slight pages and broken, incomplete, beautiful sentences. And, I think I have a sense that it, like The Lover, is worthy of a second or third or fourth reading; maybe one or two or three more which should be afforded to it soon. I know, after putting it down, I thought immediately of picking it up again for another whirlwind tour of its form and relationships and its soul.What impressed me most about this book is perhaps the thing I tried to share in an instagram post I wrote about it earlier this week. This novella, which Duras was bold enough to call a novel, is not really a novel, and is perhaps closer to a book of poetry in many of its ways, but then is actually more like a piece of theater, at times looking and feeling and reading like it in your head, and then it transfers into the precise benign imagery of great mid-century film-making, black and white and grey-scaled, before the broken sentence structure and jilted and direct dialogue and fragmentary thinking reminds, once again, of poetry - which is to say that it fills you with all sorts of questions that you can\u2019t form into a shape. It is something special.At the end of the book are two pages of theater notes. Tonight I left my parents\u2019 house, used my dad\u2019s car and everything, to go downtown and see a musical that an acquaintance had invited me to. He was in it. I don\u2019t know him well, but I think he likes reading. I know I mentioned this book to him, said he might be into it given his background in theater and all that, and he told me that he had a copy of The Lover on his shelf. I wanted to give it to him. Before the musical I was planning to say something like \u201cif you don\u2019t love this book after reading it then I want it back. But if it is going to help you make something beautiful and meaningful and something that captures the spirit of this book, then I want you to keep it.\u201d But after seeing the musical, this silly romp about breaking up with boyfriends and using all sorts of famous music from the 60s and 70s to help the women navigate the breakup, I doubted that it was the book for him. I don\u2019t know why. I shouldn\u2019t judge an actor for the work that he takes on to keep food on his table. But I carried my copy with me to the show, excited to share it and bond a bit more over art, and afterwards I hid it under my scarf while waiting for him and then chatting with him in the lobby. He is a nice chap, and it may be that after talking to him a bit more I will decide to send it his way for a while, maybe forever, for the sake of art and its progression, but I couldn\u2019t give it to him in full confidence. That is a confidence I feel I need; this is something special, and I want it to be admired by the hands that hold it.Destroy, She Said is a marvellous book. I\u2019m glad it has brought me back to Duras with a profound respect.

It reads similar to a script and in fact later became a film, although Duras says she did not have the film in mind at first. Much of the text is conversation, not unusual for Duras, interspersed with text that amounts to stage directions. Four main characters, two women and two men, entwine in odd, mostly conversational ways at a hotel in an unnamed location surrounded by a forest. At the start there are the two men Stein and Max Thor, both guests of the hotel, who are vaguely drawn to each other. Max Thor is somewhat obsessed with another guest, Elisabeth Alione, a woman who is convalescing. The two men discuss Elisabeth, her identity and habits, and how to go about engaging with her. In time Max Thor's much younger wife Alissa shows up and the four of them begin to form an uneasy quartet, with Elisabeth at a loss regarding the others' intentions. The atmosphere is tinged with confusion, menace, and impending doom. It's almost as if the three are toying with Elisabeth, and yet there rarely seems to be anything calculating about their behavior. The suggestion of madness creeps in at times.This edition includes an interview with Duras, chiefly about the film version, and in it she talks about the lack of primacy of one character over another, and 'a gliding from one character to another.' (view spoiler)[She believes the three characters\u2014Thor, Stein, and Alissa\u2014are in fact interchangeable. What comes out of the mouth of one could just as easily come from one of the others. (hide spoiler)] This effect is palpable in the text. The highlight for me was the final lunchtime conversation after Elisabeth's husband Bernard arrives to pick her up. During their lunch together, Alissa, Stein, and Max Thor gently torment Bernard even more so than they have toyed with his wife. Here's a sample:\n'What about you?' he asks. 'What do you teach?''History,' Max Thor says. 'History of the future.'Silence. Bernard Alione gazes at Max Thor, motionless. His voice is unrecognizable now.'Is it very different?' he asks.'There's nothing left,' Max Thor says. 'So I don't say anything. The students go to sleep.'Silence. Suddenly there are gentle sobs from Elisabeth Alione.'Are there still children?' she asks.'Only children,' Max Thor says.She smiles through her tears. He takes her hand.'Oh,' she says. 'Wonderful.'\nFor those new to Duras, this is probably not a good place to start, as it exhibits her 'style' at its most extreme. And I include quotes around style because she says in the interview that she was striving to free the reader from the interference of style. Having read and enjoyed many of her novels now, though, I found this to be among her best work, showcasing much of what I have come to admire in her books."], ["\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u062c\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f. \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0634 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u062f\u062a \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0638\u0631 \u0686\u06cc!"], ["Hmm, I kinda think Duras went a little too far in the spare, nonlinear direction with this one.

I wanted to read it for the title alone, but Marguerite Duras\u2019s 1969 blissfully short book has other pleasures. In a hotel\u2019s lobby and grounds, two male guests bond over the mystery of an aloof woman who keeps pills and a book nearby as she lazes through her stay. The author blurs their identity and the reader can\u2019t keep track of which man is solemnly considering their life and her. The destroyer Alicia arrives \u2013 the married professor\u2019s younger wife- and she electrically connects the four of them. As the trio suss out the mystery woman\u2019s story of miscarriage from adultery, normative social boundaries gradually blur until even a game of cards teeters on hysteria. The quartet is broken when the woman leaves with her canned food factory owning husband, and the moment passes as our trio of monsters, Alicia and her admirers, hungers to search for her. The weight of film pulls this book into a strange territory as the separate passages feel like shots from a New Wave film with repetitive shots- sounds from tennis courts, a dark forest hedging them in. The book becomes unclassifiable due to its lightness of prose, hints of character and plot, and feel of a play. What was just four people in a boring hotel having a casual interaction becomes another Duras mystery where a danger fueled by the chaos of the erotic looms ominously. The following translation of a long/interview conversation with Duras and other filmmakers (?) is a treat that expands understanding of the novel. Reading it is like actually sitting with a group of over serious French left artists, deeply meditating on every choice Duras made in her resulting film of the book. Yes, she really wants you to consider every choice she made. She asks them to consider she wrote from a political angle and this was about destruction of the bourgeouis order, intentionally making the men- a professor and a Jewish man- interchangeable- emblems perhaps of the Left. While I don\u2019t quite grasp their fuzzy logic about pure destruction as the solution to the right\u2019s power, you have to admire Duras\u2019s audacity as an artist- her own destruction of our expectation of novels while demanding we pay attention to these details of ciphers, dissolved down almost to their gender roles. Her stripping of superfluous details only adds more mystery and reader involvement in the text. I would possibly reread this someday as you find yourself having fun slipping around trying to find where your sympathies can land in a group of feckless adulterers."]], "review_count": "36", "description": "In this classic novel by the best-selling author of The Lover, erotic intrigue masks a chillingly deceptive form of madness. Elisabeth Alione is convalescing in a hotel in rural France when she meets two men and another woman. The sophisticated dalliance among the four serves to obscure an underlying violence, which, when the curtain of civilization is drawn aside, reveals in her fellow guests a very contemporary, perhaps even new, form of insanity. Like many of Duras's novels, Destroy, She Said owes much to cinema, displaying a skillful interplay of dialogue and description. There are recurring moods and motifs from the Duras repertoire: eroticism, lassitude, stifled desire, a beautiful woman, a mysterious forest, a desolate provincial hotel. Included in this volume is an in-depth interview with Duras by Jacques Rivette and Jean Narboni.", "author": "Marguerite Duras"}, "The Shark-Infested Custard": {"average_rating": "3.86", "review": [["Okay, so I loved this, but I can't decide whether to give it three or four stars. It lost some steam towards the end, and also I felt like a book that's told from the perspective of four different people needs to make a stronger and more successful effort to differentiate their voices.... BUT, this ruled and I really did enjoy reading it. For some reason it reminded me of Jacqueline Susann, but for/about men instead of women, and set in the seventies.I recently got into a really embarrassing fight with a stranger on facebook when I overreacted to moralizing about my refined sugar consumption and other vices; I count books like this among the things I love that are shameful and likely giving me cancer. Recently I've stalled out on books with any nutritional value or moral virtue, and The Shark Infested Custard was the perfect antidote to that, basically a KFC Double Down topped with whipped cream and washed down with scotch. If you've recently quit smoking, drinking, sex, pills, or pretty much anything else fun, this might be a good read because a) it feels deliciously bad for you and b) it makes all those things I just listed seem totally gross.In case you did not, as I didn't, \"get\" the title, The Shark Infested Custard takes its title from what Willeford calls an \"old Miami riddle\": \"What is sweet, bright yellow, and extremely dangerous?\" Apparently there is also a British kiddie TV show called this, after the same joke, which seems odd considering how well the title worked to convey the lethal sleaze of 1970s Miami.Aw, hell, I'm giving this thing another star because I really did enjoy it. The best thing about the book is that it's from the point of view of these completely screwed up, horrible, unsympathetic guys, but it never breaks character or winks or gets meta for even a moment, and so you really do see things from their perspective. I would guess that most of the people whom I like and respect would really hate this book and, by extension, would hate me for liking it, so I don't recommend it unless you're a bad person or have at least got a wide unsavory streak.-----------------------------------I'm only on page thirty, but this is one of the most fucked-up books I've started in kind of a long time.In other words, so far it's pretty awesome. I've already learned a new (to me) term, \"strange,\" my new favorite-ever slang for pussy, and one of the main characters' outfits was described like this:Hank came into the living room, looking and smelling like a jai-alai player on his night off. He wore white shoes with leather tassels, and a magenta slack suit with a silk blue-and-red paisley scarf tucked in around the collar. Hank had three other tailored suits like the magenta -- wheat, blue, and chocolate -- but I hadn't seen the magenta before. The high-waisted pants, with an uncuffed flare, were double-knits, and so tight in front his equipment looked like a money bag. The short-sleeved jacket was a beltless, modified version of a bush jacket, with huge bellows side pockets.Don was the only one of us with long hair, that is, long enough, the way we all wanted to wear it. Because of our jobs, we couldn't get away with hair as long as Don's. Hank had fluffed his hair with an air-comb, and it looked much fuller than it did when he slicked it down with spray to call on doctors.\"Isn't that a new outfit?\" Eddie said.\"I've had it awhile,\" Hank said, going to the table to build a drink. \"It's the first time I've worn it, is all. I ordered the suit from a small swatch of material. Then when it was made into a suit, I saw that it was a little too much.\" He shrugged. \"But it'll do for a drive-in, I think.\"\"There's nothing wrong with that color, Hank,\" Don said. \"I like it.\"Hank added two more ice cubes to his Scotch and soda. \"It makes my face look red, is all.\"\"Your face is red,\" I said.\"But not as red as this magenta makes it look.\"\"When you pay us off tonight,\" Eddie said, \"it'll match perfectly.\"Unfortunately, I can't tell you the really fucked-up stuff, because that would be spoiling. But hopefully you've gotten a taste of its obvious awesome."], ["Well this was kind of all over the place as a novel, it's really just a series of incidents in the lives of these four single Miami playas, the kind of guys in the 70's who wore pantsuits, hit on stewardesses, drank chivas in their shagpads, and voted Nixon. So, because this is told from their persp, it is quite douchey, but it is fairly charming with it, and willeford is clearly twisting our kahunas with these guys, and enjoying himself. Still though, not cool, probably."], ["Written in the 1970s and published posthumously in 1993, this ambitious Florida novel was Mr. Willeford's longest book (per the rear cover's copy). The loose plot follows the fates of four male friends as they cover up a murder, chase skirts, and get each others backs. Cast in a noirish tone, Custard offers a great deal more. It's social gaze at surviving in hot, nasty Florida, entertaining us with the story's wicked, satirical, and humorous turns. I've read a few of Mr. Willeford's books and still like the Hoke Moseley quartet and Burnt Orange Heresy a bit more, but this vintage crime novel ranks as a gem of its own."], ["Charles Willeford felt that The Shark-Infested Custard was his masterpiece. The novel centers around four men who become friends because they all live in a Miami apartment building that caters to singles. Beyond this, the main things they have in common are a creepy crassness and an interest in the finer points of getting laid. Willeford described The Shark-Infested Custard as \"a fairly nasty picture of so-called ordinary young men who are making it down here.\" Thus, the challenge facing Willeford as a writer was to give his readers sufficient reason to want to spend 263 pages' worth of time with such an unpleasant group of protagonists. For a noirish novel, the obvious strategy would have been to hook readers with a strong narrative drive, but Willeford's episodic storytelling pointedly refuses to do this. (Perhaps it was this vaguely arty storytelling decision, in combination with the vaguely arty decision to use multiple first-person narrators, that deluded Willeford into his high opinion of this book.) Failing this, the author might try to give the book some sort of substance as sociological document, exploring the nature of a society that produces \"ordinary young men\" like these. But the novel does not seem especially interested in this, either. In the end, the problem with The Shark-Infested Custard is that it does not seem interested in much of anything other than itself."], ["The subtitle \"A Novel\" isn't quite a goddamn lie, but it's close. It's more like a set of four semiconnected short stories / novellas centered on a group of four guys making the most of the singles lifestyle in 1970s Miami. A pharmaceutical salesman, a private security operative, an airline pilot and the henpecked middleman for a luxury silverware firm, they run the gamut from cocksure shitheels to hopelessly deluded fuck-ups. Abandoning wives and lovers, committing grand theft, covering up the overdose death of a teenage girl picked up at a drive-in as the result of a bull-session bet... these smarmy yet oddly sympathetic jackasses keep digging their own holes deeper and deeper as they're drawn into crimes acutely satirizing the freewheeling morals of the swingin' '70s. The casual, nigh-sociopathic misogyny on display is fairly unnerving, until it slowly becomes apparent how their disregard for women is catching up to them, exiling them one by one from their Florida paradise to a purgatorial existence in a Chicago suburb. The plotting is a little sloppy at times, but Willeford's gleefully subversive take on the crime novel is in fit form. As in his best works, it all unravels like a grotesque shaggy dog story, building up to a typically twisted punchline. Solid stuff, but definitely not for all tastes."], ["The four stories about four Miami, Florida, friends could have been 400. I would have followed them anywhere. Where they took me was immoral, unethical, but never unpleasant. They're such good company for a group of psychopaths. Not that they seemed like madmen: all were hardworking professionals (though they weren't really), all were decent members of society (though they weren't really) and were fun-loving loyal friends (those they weren't really). The writing is rich in detail, those details of a Day-Glo past that would be overdose-inducing if rendered visually, and flat of affect, which pulled me willingly along for the ride even when it turned down dark corners. There's humor. There're mini-essays on underarm hair on women and diet and why Miami is paradise on early (though it isn't really), which makes each page dense with intelligence and entertainment. Charles Willeford is this the first time I've read you? It won't be the last!"], ["Four self-absorbed, womanizing, borderline sociopathic bachelors inhabit this novel. There's raunchy sexual content, burst of violence and sprinkles of racism. Set in the Miami of the 1970's which makes some details seem dated. Best enjoyed by middle-aged men and I get the sense that women will not find this novel cute, endearing or funny.An oddly structured novel, with lots of descriptive filler as though the author just wanted to hit a word count; then again lots of authors seem to do that--which bugs me.Didn't love it, didn't hate it. I really like the author but I think this is one of his weakest."], ["Completely chilling, more in the contrast between its banality and the casual violence, though the violence is real enough in this humid Miami of the lower white-collar worker with aspirations and rampant masculinity. Interchangeable stewardesses abound, nubile sex-starved Cubans too, the man certainly has one use for women. But it's a hard book to put down; the characters may be unlikeable but they are certainly unforgettable. And the neighborhood grocery store owner with 27 hits under his belt? Pure genius."], ["It's a very well-woven story that rewards patience because it doesn't really start to come together until about 2/3 of the way through. It's also quite cutting and clever at times, which is appealing. That said, none of the four central characters is remotely appealing (by intent, one assumes), and the casual racism and rampaging misogyny are pretty hard to take, even if they are somewhat accurate representations of mid-1970s attitudes."], ["Charles Willeford wrote \u201cThe Shark-Infested Custard\u201d in 1975 but couldn\u2019t get it published because it was considered too depressing; in fact, it\u2019s pretty close to perfect.Willeford is best known for his Hoke Moseley novels which were published in the 1980s. The Moseley novels are more police procedural than noir (but, nevertheless very good), but \u201cThe Shark-Infested Custard\u201d is pure noir. There are four protagonists. The novel is divided into four interlocking stories, each with one of the four as the protagonist. Each is reasonably successful. Don Lucchesi is the Florida representative for a silverware company. Eddie Miller is a pilot for an airline, Hank Norton is a salesman for a drug company, and Larry Dolman is a low-level executive for a private security company. All make pretty good money and they all receive promotions during the course of the book. They are also typical noir protagonists. Each is flawed and because of his flaw he makes a mistake, which leads to more mistakes, confusion ensues, and the consequences are horrendous.When we first meet them they are all single (Don is separated) and living at a singles apartment complex in Miami. All fancy themselves to be lady\u2019s men, with Hank being the lead dog. He makes a bet that he can even pick up a woman at a drive-in. He does so and before you know it, two people are dead. By the end of the novel, two more will be dead.How are these men flawed? They\u2019re all casual racists and not so casual misogynists. Women are strictly pieces of meat to these guys. A woman\u2019s appeal is strictly physical. How long are her legs? How large are her breasts? How does she smell? And they\u2019ll think nothing of cheating on a wife or girlfriend or simply walking out on them if they think something better has come along.Some critics have called the four protagonists sociopaths, but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re relatively successful. They\u2019re conscientious when it comes to their jobs and their friends (and for Don, his daughter). They\u2019re just typical male specimens of that period that came after the sexual revolution and before AIDS. They\u2019re part of the \u201cMe Generation.\u201d They\u2019re into self-fulfillment and self-actualization and self-realization. They\u2019re strictly into doing their own thing. They\u2019ve got their own bag. Dig it?In other words, they\u2019re extreme narcissists.Williford said, \u201cThe Shark-Infested Custard\u201d \"says a good deal about the brutalization of urban life\u2014at least in Miami. It\u2019s written in the hard-boiled tradition of James M. Cain, Horace McCoy, and I suppose, it is a fairly nasty picture of so-called ordinary young men who are making it down here. But such was my intention . . .\u201dCalling the protagonists sociopaths misses the point. A sociopath is exceptional, a clinical case, somebody out of the ordinary.

There aren't too many left to read now. The remaining ones are rare and very very expensive.I adored The Machine in Ward Eleven. It consists of six short stories. They may best be described as strange. Willeford experiments with different formats (one sided conversation, a letter, a police interview and even entries from a journal) and points of views. The central themes are intervention in an individual\u2019s life by the man and madness. The first story is The Machine in Ward Eleven - it is about a famous film director J.C.Blake (I've read that you're supposed to watch out for the initials J.C. in a name) who has retreated into a mental asylum. He is sort of hiding out at the asylum after he breaks down on a movie set and becomes disillusioned with the American dream. But the doctors at the mental asylum decide that they are going to give him electric shocks and send him home. But he does not want to. Willeford once said that madness was a predominant theme and a normal condition for Americans living in the second half of the 20th century. So this film director guy hides out in a mental asylum to escape the mad outside world but the powers that be (the doctors) try to smoke him out of there. I like the way Willeford gets to the central theme in this story. Written in first person, we are treated to the director's daily life in the asylum which involves smoking lots of cigarettes, reminiscing about his days as a director and barely interacting with fellow inmates. The second story is a long one sided conversation where a producer talks about the mad director Blake. It is a long and candid meditation on the nature of cinema from a producer\u2019s point of view. The third story is a letter written by an alcoholic about how the system tries to prevent him from joining alcoholics anonymous. I thought it was quite funny. The fourth story contains entries from the journal of a solitary soldier who is posted at a remote airfield in Tibet (possibly for deliberately murdering his superior's dog). One of the entries had bits from Willeford\u2019s autobiography Something about a Soldier. I liked the setting of the remote airfield and the lonely life of the soldier eating beans and corned beef every day of his life. The fifth story is about this loser who is inspired by television to become a barroom habitu\u00e9 and answerman. This one was really tongue in cheek. The final story \u201cThe Alectryomancer\u201d was set in the West Indies. I wasn\u2019t sure what it meant. But it was entertaining and intriguing as hell. This collection of short stories is among my favorite Willeford books now."], ["I liked this book of Willeford short stories. I liked it. I didn't love it as much as did some of his novels. It's a must if you consider yourself a Willeford fan. That is if you've seen the movie, The Woman Chaser, read all the Hoke Mosleys, including the manuscript of Grimhaven, and have scoured used book stories for impossible-to-find paperbacks of his then you have to read this. But, if all that is true, then you've already have read this. Sorry. Never mind."], ["I've been a Willeford fan for years. I believe it was a review by Alberto (or perhaps Col) that brought this collection of short stories to my attention.Three of the stories in this collection feature variations on the same character. The others are the kind of \"twist ending\" stories popularized by The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv series and anthologies of the early 1960's.The 1st story, \"The Machine In Ward Eleven\" originally appeared in Playboy Magazine in 1961.\"Selected Incidents\" appeared in the 1960's in Gent Magazine. Gent -if memory serves- was a cheesecake magazine with a literary bent.No sources are cited for any previous publication of my personal favorite story in this collection \"Jake's Journal\"; the same for \"Just Like On Television--!\".The final story in this collection \"The Alectryomancer\" originally appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine in 1959.To my knowledge this collection (originally published in 1963 in paperback by Belmont Productions) is out of print but copies abound from Amazon to eBay to your local used paperback shack. Prices vary but you can score a copy for under $6 the last I checked.If you're a Willeford completist, this is a must have."], ["Short story collection from one of my favorite noir authors. Willeford is all over the map here, trying his hand at psychological horror, absurdist fable, and the occasional Twilight Zone piece.

Creepy, crazy Kosinsky meets, well, Willeford."], ["That was a fun read. Willeford was a favorite and inspiration of my father's (Blaster Al Ackerman) and I can totally see the affinity after reading these.

As a whole, this collection is a lot tighter than The Second Half of the Double Feature. I've been reading his earlier stuff lately (Pick Up, Burnt Orange Heresy, Cockfighter, etc.), and this is definitely more of the ilk of his earlier novels: more noir and characters who you aren't quite sure are totally there, less gritty Miami cocaine crime fiction. I dunno, I still like Hoke Moseley the bestest best, but I like these little short stories that are a little off the rocker. Any of these characters might be mentally deranged or not.

The book, which is very slim, coming in at just over 140 pages, is comprised of six related stories. The titular story is the best in the bunch. While they are all related, some more so than others, they are not all as strong as the first one, and I do not believe they can stand on their own, except for the first story, and the last one in the book. The book was written well over fifty years ago, and I feel that some of the writing is dated. The third piece, is well written and interesting, and fits in with the theme and flow, but I think needs to be tied in better. All in all I was disappointed with the book as a whole."], ["Pulp madnessI hesitate to call this a \"redux\" of another Pulp category, but it does continue Willeford's excellent work in \"Pick Up.\"I say this in the sense that in that earlier novel, the hero is also (self)committed to a (nearly)psycho ward.

I had read the reviews that likened Wolfe to a voyeur and questioned his motivation in spending years \"observing\" typical college students fifty years his junior. It seemed creepy. But when I saw it in the bargain bin, I couldn't resist, and as it turned out, I couldn't put the thing down. Wolfe is a great writer and storyteller, and although there are some weird things about the book, like his linguistic obsessions over current uses of profanity, he presents a compelling story and a fascinating character in Charlotte. Charlotte, a brilliant student from the impoverished, rural North Carolina, earns a scholarship to the prestigious Dupont University, and dreams of intellectual stimulation unlike she has ever known. Instead, she finds a world of wealth, privilege, and debauchery. Although she wants to play the games of sexual intrigue of her classmates, she has none of the requisite accompanying hardness and cynicism, so her efforts are personally devastating. Wolfe deftly tackles big themes--purity, vanity, greed, social class. He may have gotten some of the details wrong, and if you are currently a college student I'm sure you will find much with which to quarrel, but the bigger story is superb."], ["Wolfe could not seem to decide whether he wanted Charlotte Simmons to be a satire or a legitimate zeitgeist piece. Thus, the characters come off as caricatures to ill effect. Wolfe should take a page from Sinclair Lewis, who somehow managed to write biting satire with still-believable protagonists at the helm. Wolfe could have also gone all out and just made this an absurd piece of literature, but he clearly intended to use this book as a revelation on modern college life.In Wolfe's defense:Though I think there are legitimate criticisms of Charlotte Simmons, the most frequent one, the \"look at how this prude old guy is so freaked out by young people today\" criticism is problematic on several levels. First: it is possible for an author to create an authentic protagonist with whom s/he has little in common. Take Mark Twain's feat of writing from the perspective of a boy in Huck Finn or Sinclair Lewis's believable boob Babbitt in the eponymous book. Wolfe may come from a different generation than his characters, but this does not preclude him from channeling universal emotions through his characters, emotions like self-doubt, alienation, etc.A favorable reviewer on Amazon rightly pointed out that those who criticize Wolfe for not getting this current generation are missing the point. Wolfe is asking the reader to step outside the decadent conventions of this group in order to question why it they are so blindly accepted. To dismiss him because he seems so shocked! by the generation he portrays is to buy into the legitimacy of this (my) generation's norms. Like so many American novels before it, I Am Charlotte Simmons indicts complacent conformity. Perhaps it's easier to recognize these themes in novels where the author is skewering the prudish, straight-laced yesmen rather than the indulgent, counter-traditional ones, but both societies signify rigidity and intolerance towards deviating norms. The pendulum has just shifted in the sense that polite conversation is now quite hospitable to the impolite, but now the diplomat is the odd man out. Being different is hard, whether you're a wandering musician in 1950s America or an intellecutally curious girl from a quiet mountain town in millenial America.My biggest issue: I am most disappointed with how unedited I Am Charlotte Simmons seems at times. Wolfe could have pared this book down a lot. He simply writes too much, sometimes mercilessly belaboring his point. Still, I think the generic criticisms of this book are ignorant of a novel's purpose."], ["Fuck me. I thought everyone was overreacting and being all tight-assed about this book for some reason, and I know one or two people who like this book, so I thought I'd give it a shot, but holy fuck... This book really is an 80 year old white Southern guy's 700+ page rant about kids these days. Tom Wolfe supposedly did years of research for this book to capture the social reality of college, but I guess he was too busy banging undergrads to really pay attention to what was going on around him because this is completely fucking imbecilic on every conceivable level. It bears almost no relationship to social reality. Which is a HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM when you make it your stated goal to be our time's Charles Dickens. Look, I get it, he's asking us to step outside the norms to question the norms, but HE GETS THE NORMS WRONG BECAUSE HE'S A FUCKING DULLARD AND APPARENTLY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING. So he's asking us, really, either to question NONEXISTENT FUCKING NORMS or to question NORMS WE'VE ALREADY QUESTIONED. if the point of this book is that frat kids suck, dorms are a nightmare, and people do stupid shit, guess what, Tom 'Fuck-You-Look-At-My-Suit' Wolfe?

FUCK YOU, TOM WOLFE, AND FUCK EVERYONE WHO LIKES THIS BOOK. Lastly, 'fuck patois,' seriously? Fucking seriously? Tom Wolfe, responsible for much excellent journalism, has become a worse novelist than Steph Meyer. Good job. This might be the single worst novel I've ever read."], ["Halfway through Tom Wolfe's enormous new novel about contemporary college life, I finally devised a question to keep my interest piqued: \"Is it humanly possible,\" I wondered, \"to write another 100 pages - another 200 pages, another 300 pages - without describing a single surprising event?\"It is.With \"I Am Charlotte Simmons,\" Wolfe has ventured onto the university campus and sent back reams of hyperventilating testimony: College students are slovenly and crude. They drink way too much. They listen to obscene music. They engage in casual and exploitative sex. They put their feet on the furniture - even leather sofas and fine woodwork.But wait, there's more: College students would rather socialize than study. It's all right here, spelled out in tones of amazement, like George H.W. Bush telling us about those new scanners at the grocery store.If you haven't seen \"Animal House\" or anything on the WB, you'll be surprised to learn that collegiate society is divided between \"jocks\" and \"nerds.\" The jocks are very athletic, but not very smart, whereas the nerds are very smart, but not very athletic.Am I going too fast?To write this novel, Wolfe claims that he \"had only to reassemble the material he had accumulated visiting campuses across the country,\" a technique that may explain the book's superficiality. This isn't the anthropology of the Ordinary - a potentially revelatory approach; it's just a dramatization of clich\u00e9s.Even the style lacks Wolfe's usual verve. He's particularly interested in the way modern Americans talk, but in his Rip Van Winkle voice, we get endless explanations and reenactments of what he calls the \"undergraduate vocabulary,\" a discovery he highlights in a brief dedication to his children. Most of the dialogue is written in a profane patois that Wolfe spells out as though he's recording the grunts and clicks of a lost dialect from Inner Mongolia. But he has nothing to add to Norman Mailer's far more daring analysis of American profanity some 40 years ago in \"Armies of the Night.\"Even more tedious than the affected slips of Southern and African-American dialects are his needless parenthetical translations: I can't (cain't) stand them('em). And when characters yell at each other, their words are written in caps so that we know THEY'RE SPEAKING VERY LOUDLY.The story follows the rise and fall of Charlotte Simmons, a brilliant country bumpkin from Sparta, N.C., (pop. 900), who wins a scholarship to Dupont University, one of the most prestigious institutions in the country. Charlotte's parents are simple folk, devout Christians, who have instilled in their daughter a deep sense of morality. They don't drink, swear, put on airs, or take no stock in your highfalutin citified ways. Along with a devoted teacher at school, they have instilled in Charlotte a sense of her exceptionalism that inspires the novel's title, which is also a sort of inspirational mantra for the heroine.Charlotte heads off to Dupont University expecting to enter the august halls of academe, but she quickly finds that it's a brothel, seething with vain, vicious girls and crude, drunken boys. Her snobby roommate won't have anything to do with her. The coed bathrooms are an abomination. Athletes on the basketball team don't take their classes seriously. And hunky frat boys pretend to be interested in your mind, but they're interested in only one thing. (I won't spoil it for you.)Poor Charlotte is consumed with loneliness and confusion. Everyone mocks her clothes, her naivet\u00e9, her virginity, her tee-totaling. Professors recognize her brilliance, but brilliance doesn't matter in this marketplace of drunken flesh. So, how can she resist when the hottest boy on campus asks her to the Spring Formal? (Wolfe Note: The term \"hottest\" is not a reference to the temperature of his body, but to the developed musculature of his body, which, along with a number of male bodies in this book, is described with slobbering attention.)Meanwhile, one of the nerds who works for the school paper (where else?) is pursuing a scandal that could rock American politics, but don't worry about that potentially interesting thread; it never leads off campus - or toward anything.The only issue that develops some traction in this novel is race. Wolfe explored that more profoundly in \"The Bonfire of Vanities\" and \"A Man in Full,\" but his portrayal here of the racial tensions on the college basketball court is engaging. He shows a sport played largely by black men for the entertainment of white fans in an academic setting that contorts its principles to keep the whole industry going.The cynical coach reaps millions; the pasty professor growls about academic standards; the expedient college president maintains an uneasy truce. All these characters play to type, but at the center of this subplot is a white basketball star who feels threatened by the talent and aggression of black players all around him. Why, he wonders, do they have access to a whole range of words and stances that are forbidden to him? What's more, he's starting to feel attracted to a life of the mind that he can just barely imagine. But this minor development is buried in a variety of borrowed plot lines, including a climactic bit of satire about political correctness that might have been sharp 20 years ago.The problem isn't really the inclusion of so many clich\u00e9 characters; sadly, there are plenty of real students who fall into these categories. What's galling about this novel is its persistent lack of nuance, its reduction of the whole spectrum of people on a college campus to these garish primary colors.Wolfe wrote a much discussed essay for Harper's in 1989, \"A Literary Manifesto for the New Social Novel.\" Instead of the cerebral games that now pass for fiction, he argued, American novelists should \"head out into this wild, bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping Baroque country of ours and reclaim it as literary property.\" This is good advice. When he took it, he hog-stomped out two baroque novels, first about New York and then about Atlanta. But cooped up on campus with \"Charlotte Simmons\" he's too predictable and too late to reclaim anything of interest.http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1109/p1..."], ["Any girl who has ever gone through the journey of the small liberal arts big name college will know parts of Charlotte in ways that take them back to times and insecurities that are far better left forgotten. Charlotte, the brain trust of her small town, enters the world of the privledged \"it's mine because I'm entitled to it\" college student. It should be a coming of age tale, and it is but in the twisted way. Charlotte loses herself and every belief she held to fit in from the first day of her freshman year to the last day of her senior. Her uncooth parents embarass her, and so she pushes them away. She is so insecure that she constantly obsesses about what she wears, what she eats, who she is seen with, how she speaks, and with whom she sleeps. After a few months, it's clear that she has lost her identity entirely. My favorite part about this book is what makes it real - disturbing but true - she doesn't come back around. And I think that's a reality. When we lose ourselves, we don't get that self back, we just create a new one. Maybe that new one mimics many parts of the old self, but the new insecurities prevent it from every returning to the original. If you want a pick me up, this is not the book. However, if you have been in this world and want to appreciate how you made it through and appreciate life on the other side, you won't be disappointed."], ["I picked this up at the big garage sale that my work puts on. It caught my eye and I remember being interested in it after reading a review of it when it came out. It's a pretty thick book, over 750 pages, and I didn't plan on reading it for a while. I read the first few chapters when I got home and got very caught up in it. It is one of those books where once you've start reading it, everything else in your life takes a back seat and you can't do anything else but read the book until you're done. Apparently all of Tom Wolfe's books are like that, though I've only read this one. I'll let the New York Times say it better than I can: \"Like everything Wolfe writes, 'I Am Charlotte Simmons' grabs your interest at the outset and saps the desire to do anything else until you finish.\"The book is basically a critique of the current state of higher education and the university lifestyle. The three main characters are students at a Dupont, a fictional prestigious liberal arts school on the east coast and their lives intersect through various plot threads. The title character, Charlotte, is the fish out of water from a small working-class town in West Virginia. She comes to Dupont full of innocence and ideals and the book is propelled by the story of her inevitable fall from grace and eventual redemption. There is one long extended chapter the book about Charlotte going to the big fraternity formal with her new boyfriend and his friends. Wolfe describes what is happening in real time with great detail (both material and emotional), and the result is an incredible and extremely moving piece of writing. If movies that present prom night as an magical evening where everyone's problems are somehow resolved are a zero on the realism scale, Wolfe's description of Charlotte's experience is an easy 10 .One of the things that Wolfe does really well is observe the motivations behind people's words and actions, analyzing people in much the same way that a biologist would study the behavior of animals. To Tom Wolfe, every human interaction is a struggle for dominance, and he makes his case convincingly enough particularly when applied to the seemingly simple but incredibly complex social codes of the fraternities and sororities. Wolfe does stumble occasionally, getting a bit out of his element, particularly when attempting to recreate the dialogue and slang of the black players on the college basketball team. He creates a rapper called Doctor Dis and writes lyrics for his songs in a few cringe-inducing passages. Still, you've got to give an old white guy credit for an attempt. A large part of Wolfe's critique is about class, and the sense of entitlement that well-heeled and well-educated feel. Wolfe lays it on a little too thick in describing Charlotte's humble background, however, and details like Charlotte's family having to use a picnic table inside because they couldn't afford a dining table seemed forced. One final criticism that I'll make is that I though that the end was too neat and sudden. I expected more of a payoff, though I was satisfied enough (if only just to see Charlotte okay again after everything that Wolfe puts her through).This book got a lot of mixed reviews, and some critics really panned it, seeing it as a one of Wolfe's lesser books. I'm not familiar with his other works and with nothing else to compare it to, I was blown away and completely engrossed. I'd strongly recommend it, though only if you can afford to disappear for a week."]], "review_count": "1628", "description": "Tom Wolfe, the master social novelist of our time, the spot-on chronicler of all things contemporary and cultural, presents a sensational new novel about life, love, and learning--or the lack of it--amid today's American colleges.<br /><br />Our story unfolds at fictional Dupont University: those Olympian halls of scholarship housing the cream of America's youth, the roseate Gothic spires and manicured lawns suffused with tradition . . .

As a writer, Willeford is very difficult to categorize and rightly so. I\u2019ve read almost all of his books and they range from absurd to zany from intense to humorous. The Woman Chaser falls somewhere between a to z starting with the opening paragraph which begins like a movie script. For good reason, too. After a few chapters that's what it's about; a movie script and Richard Hudson's life in humdrum Amercia, living (or not) the Amercian dream. Hudson is an off-the-chart great used car salesman who gets bored with all the money he\u2019s made selling used cars. With the big \u2018thumbs up\u2019 from his boss in San Francisco, Richard buys a used car lot in Los Angeles, gussies it up, staffs it, reconnects with his family (he grew up in LA) and soon thereafter leaves for a hotel room to write his first movie script. He has a strong desire, an urgent need to be creative apparently having lost his himself in making money in the used car business. Richard is like 'is this all there is?' or \u2018What\u2019s it all About, Alfie?\u201dHis family consists of his \u2018forever a ballerina\u2019 mother, step-father who is about his age and a down and out movie producer, and his step-sister, a nubile teenager. Beginning with absurd or ending with zany, either term will do, my favorite part in the book is when he finds his mother in the well-appointed basement ballet dancing to The Miraculous Mandarin. He strips off his shirt and begins dancing with her becoming the \u201cthe Miraculous Mandarin himself, the damndest Chinaman anybody ever saw! I chased, I pursued, I made impossible leaps and came down as lightly as a wind-wafted cigarette paper.\u201d What a sight, in my mind, to behold when Richard \u201cpranced, cavorted, darted, turned, glided, bent, stretched, and did a mad fouetee on one leg\u201d until he almost lost reason, he says. That was the turning point, when he decided that writing and directing the movie was his destiny. The only reason for his existence at this point in his life.I found myself from time to time thinking about the movie American Beauty, a mid-life crisis in the making. Here's Richard, in mid-life crisis mode, and I'm reading it line by line. And the title, well, women are throwaways for him, but then so is everything else when he decides his life is not complete until his movie is written, directed (by himself, of course) and in the theaters as the biggest success since Gone With the Wind. When his masterpiece is completed, well, that\u2019s the story, so I\u2019ll leave it up to you to take the time to read this little jewel of a book, a scant 192 pages. In my view, Willeford is underestimated, if estimated at all on anyone\u2019s radar. He\u2019s relatively unknown except for those interested in noir (he wrote from the 1950's-1980's) although he can\u2019t, in my mind, be classified in that category either. But he was a great underrated talent who should be studied in creative writing classes and read by even more readers than some of the noted authors of today. He's a vivid and a simply great writer in my opinion. In my list of favorite authors, Willeford is right up there with my favorites. My only regret is that he went long periods of time (12 years) without writing or publishing anything so he has a very small library of books; unfortunately, I\u2019m near the end of reading them. Too bad for me but good for you if you haven\u2019t read him. He\u2019s a must in on my list and you are missing out if you haven't read him yet."], ["Charles Willeford is one of those rare authors who makes me laugh out loud in book after book. Donald Westlake is another. It's their deadpan delivery or something.

Charles Willeford rules!"], ["This is a very strange book in it's way. The first half of the book Richard Hudson, a used-car salesman, has returned to his native L.A. to establish a franchise. He sets up the car lot, wanes philosophical about American greed (dividing the world into Feebs, feeble-minded rubes, and those who-understand-how-the world-works), sets up house at his childhood home with his prima-donna mother and her disgraced movie producer husband, and beds his sister. It reads a bit like American Psycho. Then in act two Hudson decides to makes a movie. He writes the script, which is dark and bizarre, and directs the thing. The book keeps things flowing with most of the action focusing on selling the movie to the studio and gathering people to make the movie. Things don't go the way he expects and all hell breaks loose.The last act is his running around doing insane things. I don't want to give away too much.The book in someways mirrors the plot of the movie, but not too much as to be tacky. The writing and pacing of the story is great, and while the main character isn't likable in the least, you can understand him. I suppose the theme of the book, or rather it's moral, is that we are the people who, carelessly, make the world a rotten place. We remember that girl who broke our hearts and callously disregard those hearts we broke. We're thieves that complain bitterly when robbed.Not a polite read, but a fun one."], ["\u201cThis is what I learned about a story at Mammoth Studios: A likeable and sympathetic hero, one who affords a good measure of viewer-identification, and around whom the story revolves, is faced with the necessity of solving a serious and urgent problem which affects his vital interests. The hero makes an effort to solve his problem, but this only succeeds in making matters worse. (This is me all right). The hero\u2019s efforts all lead to a series of increasingly harder complications. Each new complication is related to the original problem. (This isn\u2019t me, or is it?) Anyway, there is an integrated series of complications which build up in intensity until a definite point or crisis is reached. It is here that the reader cannot possibly understand how the hero can possibly succeed. But now the hero makes one last and heroic attempt to resolve his difficulties, and in every case it must be his own individual efforts that solve the dilemma (s). Under no circumstances can he accept any form of outside aid to make things easier for him.\u201dIt\u2019s a long quote, I know, but a great dissection of a type of story-writing. This comes from the narrator of our story, a successful car salesman called Richard Hudson.The opening has Hudson watching a used Los Angeles car lot that he intends to buy. He analyses the pros and cons of the place with ruthless application and proceeds with his purchase for the business. It\u2019s a classy, beautifully written beginning that really sucked me in completely. Like the quote above says, we have our sympathetic hero with whom we can identify.From there, we\u2019re transported into an analysis of the art of story-telling in the film world. It\u2019s a little unsettling, but it\u2019s not long before the thread of the narrative is resumed.Essentially we have a tale being told in flashback. It\u2019s a great way of grabbing attention and sows the seeds of tension because we know we\u2019re heading for some kind of fall.Hudson moves back in with his eccentric mother and family. He spends a lot of time with his step-father, a genius of cinema who has lost his way. As they hang around together, Hudson realises that he needs something to fill the emptiness of his life and the creation of a film seems to be the obvious thing for him to do. He has an amazing knowledge of cinema and his step-father allows him an insight that many script-writers might die for.The creation of the film and the obsession of the writer are gripping. There are many occasions when I wanted to leap in and offer advice - after all, I know already that things aren\u2019t set to end well.A huge amount of the book is absolutely brilliant.What lets it down a little is Hudson\u2019s determination to do things his own way. He wants to do something that is out of the ordinary and he can\u2019t bear the interference of the man at the top who wants control of the piece. His obsession turns into a kind of madness and in this madness lies his downfall. The problem for me here is that the book also works to its own calamity of an ending and for me Hudson had become so despicable that I didn\u2019t care a hoot for him anymore. He was no longer my slightly flawed hero, but had turned himself into the villain of the piece. While I\u2019m sure that was deliberate, there was something about it that felt a little disappointing. Maybe if I\u2019d realised earlier what a toe-rag the man was (and there were plenty of serious clues, believe me), I might have read in a different way.Willeford certainly tells an incredible story with great flair and skill. The voice and the whole situation are brilliantly done. Because of that, I\u2019m slightly disappointed in myself for not loving the entirety of the book to pieces. This one\u2019s definitely worth a read and I\u2019m sure will ignite a whole batch of questions for you as a reader."], ["The Woman Chaser (1960) by Charles Willeford is a curiously titled novel since most of the woman chasing by the protagonist Richard Hudson is away from him. Perhaps, it was a marketing ploy, but this novel is more about artistic integrity and the used car industry than it is about womanizing, although there is some of that. It is a kind of a crime noir for sure with its bleak worldview about \u201cstraight society.\u201d Hudson is a successful used car salesman who feels the need for more in life, but it is not a family that he longs for, rather he feels that the need to create in order to truly be alive. So he decides to make a low-budget film with his stepfather, a former studio director. However, Hudson is unwilling to compromise, either to pad the film to make it longer for theatrical release, nor is he willing to trim it for airing on TV (cable would have solved this problem today). His partners decide to air in on TV and Hudson spirals into anger and depression, wrecking havoc on anyone who crosses his path.

Hoke is a middle-aged Miami P.D. homicide detective who\u2019s been gutted financially by a divorce and has been reduced to living in a tiny room in a run-down residential hotel that is inconveniently located just outside the Miami city limits. Inconveniently, because Hoke\u2019s boss has just laid down the law and announced that the department will begin rigorously enforcing the requirement that all city police officers must actually live in Miami. Hoke has only a couple of weeks to find a new place to live, a herculean task given his financial straits and the scarcity of affordable housing in the city.To compound his difficulties, Hoke\u2019s ex-wife has decided to move from Florida to California to live with a major league baseball player who\u2019s just signed a huge new contract. The ball player is not enamored of Hoke\u2019s fourteen and sixteen year-old daughters and so, with no forewarning, the ex-wife packs up the girls and ships them off to live with Hoke who hasn\u2019t had any contact with his daughters in years.Things are almost as bleak on the job front. Hoke\u2019s ambitious boss is bucking for a promotion and as a part of his campaign, he details Hoke, Hoke\u2019s former partner Bill Henderson, and Hoke\u2019s new partner Ellita Sanchez to compromise a three-person cold case squad and assigns them fifty old cases. The Major figures that even if the team only solves a few of them it will make him look good and assure his promotion. But these cases are virtually all dogs with very little hope of solutions.Meanwhile, Hoke and Ellita have caught a death call that appears to be a simple heroin O.D. The young male victim is found the house of his shapely stepmother with whom he has been rooming. The case itself seems a slam dunk, but it\u2019s going to take time and effort to get the case processed and the paper work done. On the bright side, though, Hoke sees romantic possibilities with the stepmother who owns a flower shop and who readily agrees that she might enjoy lunching with Hoke someday soon.Complications ensue as they usually do, on virtually every front of Hoke\u2019s life. In and around working his cases and training his new partner, he\u2019s got to find a new home and the days are dwindling down to a precious few on that front. All in all, it\u2019s a very entertaining story with a lot of humor. Willeford was a master at this sort of thing and he develops both the plot and his characters with a sure hand. A very good sequel to the novel that introduced Hoke Moseley."], ["New Hope for the Dead is Charles Willeford's follow up to Miami Blues, the debut appearance of series detective Moseley. Except it's an entirely different beast of a novel. Willeford clearly didn't anticipate Moseley becoming a repeat performer in that first outing, making him secondary to the crazy Freddie Frenger Jr. and so this second novel gave him an opportunity to really flesh out the character, establish his world and really outline where this series of books is headed.This time out Moseley is far less of a buffoon for example, instead of actively wallowing in how far he has fallen as a man Hoke is proactive, he knows things are bed and he wants to be a better man for his partner, his daughters, himself. It's an interesting flip but written in such a way, with such skill and heart that it feels less like artifice on the part of the author and closer to a natural progression of the character.Instead of focussing on a particular crime or series of crimes for his detective to solve Willeford uses the novel to critique the politics and social development of Miami in the 80s and this combined with the fascinating character study that is the portrait of Sergeant Hoke Moseley marks the series as unique and worthy of a place in any crime aficionados collection."], ["Lacking the great antagonist of Willeford's first novel, Miami Blues (played in the film of the same name by a young Alec Baldwin in full anarchic, scene-chewing glee), New Hope for the Dead seems to suffer from a sense of direction and purpose as the first novel in the series. Indeed, it was bit of a plod until Hoke Moseley and crew undertook the burden of 50 cold case files thrown at them by their ambitious boss while his two teenage daughters show up unannounced on his doorstep. The novel gathers some teeth as Moseley simultaneously juggles finding a place of residence, an emotional, homeless pregnant partner, two young daughters fending off ineligible suitors in South Beach, a severe lack of funds and some crazy criminals in all shapes and forms. Willeford purposely uses Mosely's heavy handed, blunt approach for some bewildering, humorous situations involving sex education with his teenage daughters, and an explanation of a graphic crime scene, complete with photographs, with a fellow cop while his young daughters stand by nonplussed. This book is unfortunately suffering from a severe case of middle-book identity crisis and at times Willeford seems to be rambling incoherently in a bohemian haze. It's occasionally heartened by some interesting detective work and is probably the only detective novel I have read where a case is solved by anal sex (or lack thereof).This novel is head-shaking at times and is probably only for hard-core Willeford fans. Also, it should be mentioned, disturbingly, there is an underlying current of racism and sexism which I am unsure was Willeford speaking through his character's mouth or the character himself. It was a bit of a shock to read such blatant prejudice by the main character in print from something as current as 1985, but I guess maybe I am a bit na\u00efve in that respect given the troubles in such places as Ferguson and Baltimore today. Be warned, as I am sure it will turn off some readers."], ["I might not read any other authors apart from Charles Willeford for awhile. This guy. Man.I enjoyed this just as much as Miami Blues even though I only gave it 4 stars versus the 5 I gave to MB. The crime-solvey bit that frames the middle parts is a little meh compared to that of MB, but man oh man the middle parts of this book. Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit. I burst out laughing at least three times, and if Hoke Moseley's sex talk with his daughters could be turned into a 2 minute play, I would see the damn thing every single night.

Willeford was to crime fiction what Philip.K.Dick was to sci-fi. Hoke Moseley is unlike any other police detective in the crime fiction genre. He is almost like an average middle class guy in some ways - he has to deal with rent and alimony, he has not had sex in a long time and in this book, he has to take care of his teenage daughters while he deals with gluttonous cravings and obesity. Despite being a policeman, he faces housing problems caused by mass immigration and white flight in Florida. He is also tremendously good at his job and nothing ever escapes him (because of which he has to fore go an opportunity to sleep with a beautiful woman). Moseley's interactions with his daughters was the best part of the novel. Unlike MIAMI BLUES and SIDESWIPE this Hoke Moseley novel does not have the charismatic villain. Willeford is not at the top of his game - the sharp and epic dialog is a bit scarce and the case investigations seemed like they were put together too soon. But reading about Hoke Moseley has become like meeting up with good friends (along with Hank Chinaski, Holden Caufield, Enid and Mark Renton). So I am willing to forgive a few mistakes."], ["A Hoke Moseley novel is to literature as comfort food is to cuisine.

The scene in which he figures out how a young addict was killed is wonderful. The other characters in the book, including his new partner and his daughters, are well written."], ["One way to understand the history of detective fiction is to weigh out the changing balance between character-building and the central plot. The Victorian ancestors of \"detective fiction\" proper were much richer in character than in plot. Consider The Moonstone, whose pleasure derives not so much from a stolen diamond as the round robin narrative eccentricity. The novel shows us not crime in a bare form, as golden age crime novels do (though always dressed with an inconsequential motive as though to better accentuate the ingeniousness of the act itself), but rather a relationship between character and crime. The early and mid 20th century saw a great many stripped down crime novels. Conan Doyle, the four Queens of Crime, Erle Stanley Gardner, Rex Stout, most pulp writers, etc. - all of them reduced characters to a few distinct qualities. Sometimes this sketch captures the reader in a jovially Dickensian way (e.g., Doyle or Stout) and sometimes its obvious staginess had a curious distancing effect (e.g., Poirot or Perry Mason). In all cases, however, the emphasis was on static characters, whose personalities are understood to exist separately from the experiences they undergo in the course of the novel.There were a lot of important character heavy books from the mid-century that foreshadowed a shift in balance in favor of character. Mystery is clearly a secondary element in Chandler's work (hence the famously indeterminate murder of the chauffeur). There are two central elements. The first is dialogue and the second is character. This is not to say that the mystery plot is in the margins. It remains front and center as a pretext for a paranoid grand tour of the interconnected corruption at different levels of society. Mass market writers in the sixties (Day Keene, Bruno Fischer, etc.) tend to offer a stripped-down version of the paranoid tour. If anything the view of society is even more anatomical, as stereotyped characters of all classes and professions are shown to be working for corrupt interests.This societal anatomy is formalized and delimited in a couple places. The first is the Cold War novel, where the characters are still in disguise, in that they have a cover rather than openly working for corruption. However, rather than a society of anarchically grasping people as in classic roman noir, the source of the corruption has been elegantly pared down to bad ideology. Then there is the success of the Mafia novel, where crime is similarly centralized (and therefore segregated from standard everyday American society) but cover becomes less important. These are still social anatomies, but the social rot is heavily circumscribed, unlike Chandler, where one can walk into any house and find a murderer.In all paranoid tour novels detection loses its centrality. The revelation is not the reconstruction of the true story of the crime by the detective, but that society itself is complicit. The crime is a symptom, not the illness itself.The Hoke Moseley series is a take on the paranoid tour, but also a parody of that paranoid mode. Society is pretty much irredeemable, yes, but rather than an anatomy of the social structure, one finds that society is hopelessly fragmented. There are not conspiracies, not even destructive ideologies, just greed, bad luck, and stupidity. Moseley's haplessness is correlative. The mystery novel has always been about social structures. The detective has to look into the crowd and judge. In Miami, where crime is so anonymous and society is entirely incoherent, the task itself is absurd, and can therefore only be solved through dumb chance. What most people find \"weird\" about New Hope for the Dead is that it has no center. There is little direction, little crime, little detection. We spend a lot of time just hanging out with Moseley. The central plot is about his difficulty finding an affordable new rental within Miami city limits. Willeford explodes the standard paranoid novel tactic of using a single crime to reveal a web of evil, showing instead disconnected institutional, cultural, and financial factors that are stumbling blocks. Crimes aren't united by collusion, but by life in Miami. It is not a novel of social criticism, to be sure. Willeford's reaction is bemusement, not concern. Miami is a human zoo where social controls are so broken that our native anarchy reigns.To put this into historical perspective once more, the classic detective story is about the conquest over disorder by society, an effective use of social controls. The paranoid detective story is about the tragically (if excitingly) hopeless pervasiveness of corruption. From one perspective, this is a breakdown of social controls, but what is always revealed is that there is a parallel society of crime operating under the cover of regular society. Willeford, more existential, sees that the breakdown has really destroyed the concept of society. There are conditions, and there are people. Willeford sees this with a kind of comic libertarianism. This diminished sense of belonging is frustrating, tiresome, but above all funny. Your classic detective helps render society coherent. Moseley, more dizzy, registers the incoherence and absurdity of Miami, an incoherence that seems part and parcel with the city's particular human freedom."]], "review_count": "60", "description": "Miami homicide detective Hoke Moseley is called to a posh Miami neighborhood to investigate a lethal overdose.

It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud.

Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "The Just In Time! series offers brief, practical resources of immediate help for pastors at an affordable price.<br /><br />Part of a pastor's role in the community is to pray publicly. The pastor is often the official \"pray-er\" at all kinds of community events--the high school football game, the opening of the new grocery store, the county school board meeting, kindergarten graduation--to name a few. But the pastor must also pray knowing that there are believers (of many persuasions) and non-believers present. In addition to the prayers in this book, there are brief setting descriptions and Scripture references. These prayers can be used with little or no adaptation.<br /><br />Sample prayers: Graduation: \"O God, Author of all wisdom, Giver of all truth, Seeker of all servants, we thank You for the times of life that mark Your continuing goodness. We are grateful for these believers, young in their faith and early in their journey, who have been open to study and learning and who now gain graduation toward tomorrows which will take them in many direction, but never from Your presence.\"<br /><br />Suicide: \"O God, if we knew why, we would name it before You! Hear our plea for help; hear our plea for hope. We confess that we do not grasp the depths which drive one of Your children to end the life You began. We confess that faint stirrings of guilt, soft wondering about our own inattentions, and a simple unease all groan within us. Grant us a grace which will be sufficient for our own broken and breaking places.\"<br /><br />Citizenship: \"O God, The Giver of beginnings, we praise You for giving to Your servants fresh possibilities, extended hopes, and a new nation. You have given them life and now You give them calls to new loyalties, new responsibilities, and new opportunities.

I think it made it all the stronger for me that I read it right after I read Virgil Blossom's memoir \"It HAS happened here\" about the same time in Little Rock history.

So this man can see what he's caused, and she can face her mother's killer. But finding out about that did something inside her that just turned ugly for her a child.

It was a great way to experience spirituality and romance as a teenager, but as I got older, its lusty descriptions of the true meaning of love, marriage, and life just seem like pretty, but shallow, wordplay.Now, don't write to me and prove me wrong on this, because I like the idea very much. I believe that Khalil Gibran was quite the player.

Born in Lebanon in 1883, his poetry accompanied by artwork has been translated into over twenty languages. I decided to read his opus The Prophet, which is awe inspiring poetry written in novella form. A classic that often surfaces on goodreads classics groups, The Prophet is a worthy edition to one's classics collection. Gibran's philosopher Al-Mustafa has traveled by boat to visit the Orphalese people and speak words of wisdom to them. Almitra becomes especially enamored in Al-Mustafa's teachings and either hangs onto or collaborates with him in his words as he wows the Orphalese with both his wisdom and knowledge. Gibran's words translated into English are like reading any religion's scriptures and flow like the honey of the Middle East. Passages speak of \"a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly\" and \"knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream\" yet each page of this thin volume evokes powerful philosophy. It is of little wonder that Almitra and her people would become enamored with the words of Al-Mustafa. Almitra was also a seeress in her own right and desired that Al-Mustafa remain in Orphal and that they join forces in prophecy. I found this thinking to be progressive for its time or any time. Some of Almitra's forward thinking included: \"Blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken.\" She is keen in her perceptive skills and values having one like Al-Mustafa in her midst. Yet, his destiny is not to remain in one sea faring village but to travel the region preaching words of wisdom to all people. The version I read was a pocket book that also included a few of Gibran's sketches of Al-Mustafa. Between the poetry and drawings, he has created a masterpiece that flowed on the pages. While I am used to reading psalms and prophetic teachings, I did not find Gibran's words to be anything that out of the ordinary but in comparison to the majority of secular works, his words are powerful. Although not my absolute favorite, I am glad that I read this opus and would read more of Gibran's poetry. 3.75 stars rounded to 4."], ["The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran \u0627\u06cc\u0646

I was moved beyond words, particularly when I started reading it, started to let the words wash over me, when I realized how familiar they were, not the words, but the meanings behind them.

So, that one came from this work by Edward Lear?Nonsense Story: \"The History of the Seven Families of the Lake Pipple-Popple\" is my favorite because it is easier to read and has more funny pictures. \"The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Around the World\" is also nice and it felt related to what Edward Lear dreamed when he was still alive: go around the world. Even if this is a children's book, you can still see how the poems and stories are actually based on the author's thoughts, experiences and even dreams.John Ruskin, author of The King of the Golden River, also a very recent read, has this to say about this book: \"Surely the most beneficent and innocent of all books yet produced is the \"Book of Nonsense,\" with its corollary carols, inimitable and refreshing, and perfect in rhythm. I really don't know any author to whom I am half so grateful for my idle self as Edward Lear. I shall put him first of my hundred authors.\" Coming from an author who wrote a nice novel about wind toppling the vicious brothers and some kind of powerful hermit-king turning the river into gold, adds credibility to this book. This is a nice funny book especially if you have nothing to do and you just want to enjoy simple poems with rhymes that you normally see posted on the kindergarten room's walls. Edward Lear (1812-1888) was an English artist, illustrator, author and poet, and is renowned primarily for his literary nonsense, in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form that he popularised. So, there is really a genre or sub-genre for literary nonsense. Cool, I have at least one book friends who always talks nonsense but he is funny. We don't always want to be serious, right? Besides, it is easier and more enjoyable and more beneficial to health if we laugh more in between serious matters. What is also noteworthy here is the genius of Edward Lear as an illustrator. Brilliant. Even if the figures were more than a century old, they still look fresh as if they were conceptualized by Lear only yesterday."], ["I love the poem where he introduces himself! From memory:How pleasant to know Mr Lear!Who has written such masses of stuffSome think him ill-tempered and queerBut a few find him pleasant enough.He sits in a beautiful parlourWith hundreds of books on the wallHe drinks quite a lot of MarsalaBut never gets tipsy at all.He has many friends, laymen and clericalOld Foss is the name of his catHis body is perfectly sphericalHe weareth a runcible hat.He reads, but he cannot speak, SpanishHe cannot abide ginger beerEre the years of his pilgrimage vanishHow pleasant to know Mr Lear!"], ["Throughout my idea of Lear was a Children's Limerick writer! From what I had read about his life, that made sense. He wrote those five-lines rhyming poems for the children of his patron Edward Stanley, the 13th Earl of Derby. After reading this compilation, that view of mine changed considerably! This book has the following parts and along with the reactions are listed under :1. A Book of Nonsense - \u221a :) :D(Ha-ha-ha!!!)I had read this volume earlier separately and its a joyride. Funny! A nice book for children and adults alike. By following the rhymes, you can also learn about certain pronunciations you did wrong earlier by rhyming along.2. More Nonsense - \u221a :D :)(More ha-ha-ha!!!)Funny, weird and funny! His neologisms (words not accepted in mainstream literature, but have some popular use of various kinds) are amazing to read aloud, and today many are dictionary words!3. Nonsense songs - \u221a :) :D(Ha-ha-ha. :\\ What?!? Oh! Ha!)I was a fan of Jumblies and their sieve for quite some time. And they along with Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles are Lear's reappearing heroes. Lear's nonsense songs were once so famous that some phrases became a part of mainstream literature expressions. An example is the \"Owl and the Pussy Cat\" 's 'runcible spoon'!\"They dined on mince, and slices of quinceWhich they ate with a runcible spoon;And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,They danced by the light of the moon,The moon,The moon,They danced by the light of the moon.\"But not all the as nonsensical as the poems. Some are based on \"reductio ad absurdum\" (reduction to absurdity) where an argument disproves a statement by showing its compulsive absurd conclusion.4. Nonsense stories and alphabets - \u221a :) :D(The first story is okay : typical Lear. BUT the second : Really disturbing!The parents teach children not to so some things, which they do and all the children of seven families die in weird ways. Perhaps the motivation was to teach the children a lesson of how important it it to listen to parents. But this way seems strange. And then the parents stave themselves and make a pickle of themselves and are now kept in a museum!!!What was Lear thinking writing these?They are nonsensical sure, as promised but the sense of humor is very dark and not at all suited for children. It will be disturbing to them, as per myself. This broke my perception of Lear!5. Nonsense alphabets - \u221a :) :D(Perfect for teaching infants!)6. Nonsense cookery - \u221a :) :D(What does he mean? :P )7. The Heraldic Blazon of Foss the Cat - \u221a :) :D(Hail Foss! _/\\_ ) In this collection, the type of humor ranges from typical silly, children's to really dark humor. The range I had imagined Lear was set in has been made vast considerably after reading this collection. The variety presented in this particular genre is phenomenal. It is a really good read for limerick lovers and Lear fans. I give Complete Nonsense by Edward Lear 4 stars! :)Happy reading! :)For more such reviews visit : http://dbthetablesareturned.blogspot.in/"], ["Should have read it when I was younger."], ["This is a book written by Edward Lear. This book contains his best rhyming works that he ever wrote. He includes all of his original drawings that were intended for each part of his collection of rhymes. Each rhyme was very funny. This book includes song rhymes, rhyming lyrics, stories, and alphabet rhymes. There really isn't a conflict, plot, resolution, or setting. This is basically a book of rhymes. If i was to describe this book in one word I would say that it is nonsensical. My favorite rhyme from this book is \"The Old Man with a Nose\". It was very funny and the picture went exactly along with the rhyme. This book of rhymes meets the sound characteristic for poems. All of the rhymes in this book rhyme from line to line exactly. An example of this is like in the rhyme \"The Old Man with a Beard\" the words beard and feared rhyme exactly. Each of these poems bring clear images to the readers mind. As I read each poem in this book the image that appeared in my mind was very close to the ones present with each poem. An example of the is from the poem \" The Old Man with a Nose\" as you read this poem you think of a man with a nose like an elephant, and that is exactly like the picture that is presented. The poems from this book provide very good insight. Once you read this book you can't say you are not in good spirits. Each poem is funnier than the past one. There is a lot of creative word play used in this book through the poems. There are words that are used in our everyday language that are made to work with the poems. This would be appropriate in the class room when you need to lift the spirits of the students in your classroom. This book will definatly make every student in your classroom laugh.

Here's a sample from Lear: \"There was an Old Person of Bangor, Whose face was distorted with anger! He tore off his boots, And subsisted on roots, That irascible Person of Bangor.\"Compare this to poem #21 under the heading \"Death\" in the Wordsworth Book of Limericks: \"A daring young fellow in Bangor Sneaked a super-swift jet from its hangar.

On the surface, he's an upper class British officer returned from the front after WWI to resume his position as an inspector at Scotland Yard. Underneath the handsome facade, he is the ultimate casualty of a terrible war-- tortured by his memories, haunted by a decision made in the heat of battle and abandoned by his fianc\u00e9e, he throws himself full force into solving the cases he's assigned. Instead of a partner or a sidekick, Rutledge has only the ghostly specter of a dead colleague and brother-in-arms, Hamish McCleod, to help him sort out the details. Smart and original."], ["All of the books by Charles Todd are a pleasant read with nice accurate tie-ins to the post World War I period in England, including the transitional difficulties to civilian life of the main character, Inspector Rutledge, and others who survived the war. Rutledge's transition is more difficult because he has no visible wounds, but suffers from what is now recognized as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.In this particular installment, the author (Charles Todd is actually a mother-son writing team) once again makes post World War I a substantive part of the mystery. There are two separate threads in the story: both of the mystery of who is stalking the Inspector, and the main story which is the attack on the local Inspector, a long-missing teenager, and the mystery of Firth's Woods.If you enjoy 20th century accurate historical fiction as well as mysteries this series will be enjoyable to you."], ["This is the eighth adventure of Ian Rutledge, a \u201cshell-shocked\u201d World War I veteran, back at his pre-war job at Scotland Yard, investigating and solving murders. (The books take place in 1919.) Ian is also haunted \u2013 literally- by the ghost of a Scottish soldier who reported to him during his time in the trenches. Hamish \u2013 said ghost \u2013 is not just an ephemeral lurking presence but a constant character. After eight books, Hamish has become more than tiresome; he\u2019s aggravating, much a like a neighbor\u2019s barking dog. In addition this series has become both stale and repetitive.The authors \u2013 I use the plural, as Charles Todd is actually a mother/son duo \u2013 follow a very similar outline for each of the Rutledge books. Although Ian is based in London, he spends little time there. His superior, a one dimensional bureaucrat and blowhard, assigns Rutledge to cases out in the English countryside. This is perfectly fine with the loner Ian, who hops into his \u201cmotor-car\u201d and travels to some distant small village or hamlet to solve a murder. When Ian reaches his destination he is always greeted with suspicion by the small-town folk, he drinks copious amounts of tea and sleeps little; he encounters a very obvious red-herring, i.e. a member of the community who must be guilty except he or she is not because that would be too obvious. And there is always a woman \u2013 usually a young widow \u2013 who kindles a romantic spark within Ian. Rutledge always solves the case just before he can truly fall in love and just in time for his superior to assign him to another case in another remote location. And oh yeah, there\u2019s always Hamish the Obnoxious Ghost, yammering in his impenetrable Scottish burr in the not so distant background.A Long Shadow follows this template. It differs from its predecessors in that the solution of the case \u2013 actually cases \u2013 is incredibly weak, particularly the identity of the murderer. Also Rutledge has attracted a stalker in this book, the point of which I missed.I was drawn to this series because it has all the earmarks I usually enjoy. Unfortunately to say the Rutledge books are similar is an understatement. They\u2019re all the same book. If you\u2019ve read one, you\u2019ve read them all."], ["I love Inspector Rutledge! I feel so sorry for him and wish he could find peace and a woman to love. Only thing is, when he does find peace and Hamish is gone, then the series will most likely be over, and I don't know if I want that."], ["Perhaps someone other than me can explain how a story that has very little action, populated by post WW I Brits, and whose protagonist carries someone he was forced to execute in his head can transfix me from start to finish. Must be the writing, right?The irony is that the author(s), a mother and son team are Americans and live in different cities. Must be empathy and telepathy, right?Whatever it is, they authored an outstanding mystery in this volume, the 8th in the Inspector Rutledge Series. Rutledge is dispatched by his enemy, Superintendent Bowles, to investigate the wounding by an arrow of Constable Hensley, an ex-London Bobbie, now posted to Dudlington, a very small village North of London. As he works the case he uncovers a number of unsolved disappearances that only he sees as possibly connected to Hensley's attack in the Firth Forest, a forbidding thicket outside of town, usually avoided by the locals.Eventually we meet most of the people in the town, almost all of whom, resent Rutledge's very presence to say nothing of his inquiries. The characterizations are very well done. Not everyone dislikes Rutledge. He befriends the local Doctor and Rector and gets on well with Hensley's superiors.There is also a sub-plot involving the mysterious appearance of Maxim machine gun cartridges and Rutledge's feeling he is being shadowed. In the end, Rutledge, solves the mystery in a surprising conclusion and finds the guilty party in the disappearances. He also finally meets the person who's been leaving the cartridges as he is winding up the Hensley case and the disappearances. The finale is complicated but satisfying. I can hardly wait to get to volume 9."], ["My least favorite in the series thus far. Right off the bat, two negatives. A storyline which seemingly involved a spiritualist. Thank heavens, she did it more as a lark and the story wasn't bogged down in mysticism. The second disappointment. Any hopes of a developing relationship between Ian and Elizabeth Fraser are shot to pieces in the first scenes with Rutledge. Either give him a love interest or don't. Quit with the teasing! And if that's not enough, the very ending also shoots any lingering hopes with Elizabeth right out of the water. Boo!And from the excerpt on the book jacket, I thought Frances was going to play a bigger part in the story. Another disappointment. I just did not enjoy the mystery at all. Either of them. Rutledge seemed to be bumbling along, completely clueless. The one thing which might have saved this particular book was if he had found evidence to implicate Bowles in some wrongdoing, but even that proved a disappointment. I certainly hope the next book is better and a little more creative. The Bess Crawford series seems to be more nuanced, whereas Ian Rutledge has grown a little too formulaic. I'd like to see some growth or healing or something here. Have Ian do something which will surprise me instead of the same old thing."], ["This is the first of the Inspector Ian Rutledge books I have read and, although I liked it, I think I should have read the ones preceding it to get an overall understanding of the main character. Throughout the book, Inspector Ian Rutledge, tormented by his time in the trenches in WWI, holds conversations with the spirit of Hamish (who I assume was his batman) who died in that war....but circumstances surrounding his death are sketchy and appear to be somehow the fault of Rutledge. That may be have been explained in the earlier books.That aside, the story is well done as Rutledge finds an engraved cartridge casing identical to the ones he saw in the war......and when others appear, he wonders if he is being stalked. He is then sent to an isolated village to investigate the shooting of a constable with an arrow (!) and finds himself involved in more than he bargained for.....and the cartridges continue to show up. There are plots within plots and are all tied together rather tidily in the end. Enjoyable but sometimes puzzling."], ["The best of the seriesWithout a doubt this is my favorite Inspector Rutledge book. And the most creepy! Well crafted story covering murders that happened over almost 40 yrs, and leaving one last character mysterious to the end."], ["Ian Rutledge is an awesome character who brings all the emotion from WWI and its horrors with him into his post war job. He has returned to his position at Scotland Yard where he investigates murders. The impact of the war comes across throughout the novel in the voice of Hamish McCleod, a friend and soldier, lost in the war, helping him investigate.In this particular story there are two mysteries to solve. First, who is stalking Rutledge? Second, what happened to a missing teenager who disappeared? The locals believe that she is buried in Firth's Woods, a dense, depressingly thick and dark area that people avoid because of tales about ghost hauntings. In reality, the Inspector has been sent to investigate an attack on another policeman who is critically injured in the woods. Somehow though, he feels, the cold case about the missing girl may be part of it. Thus, Rutledge needs to discover not just who tried to kill the policeman but also what happened to the missing girl and who is stalking him. In essense, Rutledge finds himself in a most complex situation that unfolds layer by layer as his investigation proceeds."], ["After reading the previous book in this series, A Cold Treachery, I was interested to see where Inspector Ian Rutledge's cases would take him next and I decided to jump right in and read the next book in the series. After all, it was already on my Kindle waiting for me, just a click away.We first encounter the inspector here on New Year's Eve, 1919, only a short while after the end of his last case. He accompanies his sister, Frances, to the house of mutual friends for a dinner party. At the party, one of the guests is alleged to have some psychic powers and she is asked to hold a seance, an activity that is very popular in the London of the day. This makes Inspector Rutledge, who has an intimate knowledge of and relationship with the dead from the recent war, very uncomfortable, and he is relieved to receive a phone call from Scotland Yard which gives him an excuse to leave.As he is leaving, he finds a brass cartridge casing on the steps outside. He picks it up and sees that there is an engraving on it. He puts it in his pocket and goes on his way, but soon he's finding other such engraved casings. Someone seems to be following him around and leaving the casings for him to find. For a man already on the knife's edge of mental collapse because of PTSD, this seems a deliberate attempt to unsettle and threaten him. Mercifully, he is called away from London to a small Northamptonshire village where the local constable has been shot and seriously wounded by a bow and arrow, while in woods that the locals consider to be haunted. Trying to find out what has happened proves difficult for Rutledge because the local folk are extremely taciturn and close-mouthed.Rutledge learns that there are other mysteries which the villagers seem intent on hiding for some reason. For example, a teenage girl disappeared from the village some three years earlier and has never been found. Her grandmother, with whom she lived, says she must have gone to London to look for her missing mother. But did she? And was the constable looking for her grave in the woods when he was shot?It soon becomes apparent to Rutledge that there is a connection between the missing girl and the wounded constable, but just what that connection is is not at all clear. Meanwhile, distressingly, Rutledge continues to find engraved cartridge casings in odd places and then while he is out in his motorcar one day, a bullet smashes his windscreen, barely missing his head. Who is this unknown adversary who appears to be stalking him? To complicate the situation further, the psychic from the New Year's Eve party shows up in the village and expresses concern about Rutledge, but is her concern genuine or is she somehow connected to the stalker?In order to solve the mysteries, Rutledge must find a way to break the silence of this unfriendly and secretive village and he must find the motive behind the disappearance of the teenager and the wounding of the constable and discover the connection between the two.This is another eloquent story of suspense told in absorbing prose with an emotional depth that gives the reader a sense of Ian Rutledge as a very real and sympathetic, if flawed, character. He is a character that we can care about, one about which we can look forward to reading more."]], "review_count": "199", "description": "\"Seamless in its storytelling and enthralling in its plotting.\"<br />--<em>Ft.

He sums up this philosophy in a quote to be found in the wonderfully written introduction to this volume: \u2018Nonsense is the breath of my nostrils\u2019, he wrote. It is a philosophy as much as a genre. For him it was a response to \u2018this ludicrously whirligig life which one suffers from first & laughs at afterwards\u2019.

It is lavishly illustrated with watercolour paintings by the Australian artist, Robert Ingpen. This is a happy combination, as Ingpen's depictions, based on Australian flora, seem to be a perfect fit for Lear's imagined Bong-tree Land. Edward Lear was one of 20 children. He suffered from epilepsy, and had a very unhappy childhood as an unwanted member of the family. He was largely brought up by an elder sister who encouraged him to develop his artistic talent. Interestingly, Sarah, another sister of his, was also a talented artist and writer, though she is largely forgotten now. This edition of the book is dedicated to her memory. It includes seven of Edward Lear's most popular poems:The Owl and the PussycatThe JumbliesThe Dong with a Luminous NoseThe New VestmentsThe Duck and the KangarooCalico Pie and How Pleasant to Know Mr. LearIt is perfectly possible to read Lear's verse in a standard collection of poetry, as words on the page without the aid of pictures. Perhaps this is how most of us remember reading him in childhood. Or perhaps you may remember them being read aloud, as hearing them aloud benefits the language enormously. I would defy anyone not to \"hear\" them in their head as they read. But there is another consideration with this particular book.For those adults - and some children - who find Lear's eccentric descriptions all but impossible to visualise, these illustrations are not only very attractive but also a great help with interpretation. Lear's sing-song language is easy and repetitive, the sound of his verse and his imagery will delight young children, yet his ideas are sometimes so ludicrous as to be unimaginable. Can you see a \"runcible spoon\" in your mind's eye? Or \"The Dong with a Luminous Nose\"? I couldn't - even though in this case Lear gives a detailed description of him - until I looked at the illustrations.\"Far and few, far and fewAre the lands where the Jumblies live;Their heads are green and their hands are blue,And they went to sea in a Sieve.\"We first hear this refrain in \"The Jumblies\", and it is then echoed in \"The Dong with a Luminous Nose\", a poignant and mournful verse. Sad though it is, it is probably my personal favourite. Perhaps though, it is as well that it is followed by \"The New Vestments\"; such a silly piece of nonsense that it makes the reader laugh out loud. And small children will love the \"rude\" and funny picture in this book. \"How Pleasant to Know Mr. LearWho has written such volumes of stuff!Some think him ill-tempered and queer,But a few think him pleasant enough.\"So where on earth did he get his odd ideas? What made him juxtapose such ridiculous items to make a more-or-less coherent whole? The answer seem to be that, in common with many comedians throughout history, he was trying to escape his own unhappiness. He started out as a draughtsman for the Zoological Society of London, making drawings of rare birds and animals. Some of his beautiful bird paintings from this time are included in the books. He entertained his employer's children with his drawings and invented nonsense rhymes, to which they showed, \"uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.\" Imagine how welcome such approval must have been to a young man who had sadly experienced little of this in his life to date. He went on to travel throughout Europe, writing and illustrating guides to various places, and these came to the attention of Queen Victoria. She was so impressed that she promptly employed Edward Lear as her drawing master. In 1870 he published his most famous poem, The Owl and the Pussycat, with which he found his perfect niche. To the end of his days he commented on the world around him in a nonsensical style, referring most revealingly once to, \"This ludicrously whirlygig life which one suffers from first and laughs at afterwards.\"Even writing what amounts to his own obituary, with a letter sent to a friend shortly before his travels, he ends it, typically,\"Oh bother!\" The text of the letter is included in the book, as is a short biography of the author. Additionally there are contributions by the illustrator, Robert Ingpen. He has written a two-page botanical study entitled \"Bong-tree land\", styled very much in the tradition of the time, plus another two pages about Bong-tree Land itself, reading rather like a nonsensical travel guide, starting,\"Visitors to Bong-tree land must be prepared to travel by sea for a year and a day from almost any port in England.\"Robert Ingpen has captured the essence and style of Edward Lear very nicely, and this provides an unexpected extra tribute to the author. Edward Lear has influenced a host of writers and comedians ever since, including Gilbert and Sullivan, A. A. Milne, Spike Milligan, The Goons, Dr. Seuss and Monty Python's Flying Circus. If you have a penchant for the ridiculous, don't make the mistake of thinking him outdated, and pass Edward Lear by - give him a try.

I guess I'd expect no other kind of tree than a bong-tree in this perverse book.\u2018&there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,With a ring at the end of his nose,His nose,His nose,With a ring at the end of his nose.\u2019Tell me they\u2019re not getting this ring from this pig\u2019s nose. flips the page.Yep, they are. They\u2019re totally asking this pig for his nose ring.Couldn\u2019t you have stopped at a portside town and bought a ring??! Their richness has oozed off the page from the very start. \u201cDear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling Your ring?\u201d Said the Piggy, \u201cI will.-The pig\u2019s lines should have been on the next line.I thought the pig asked himself for his ring.This pig\u2019s ears are crazy. There's curls all around it. Ah! So you do have money that could have been spent on a ring!Wait, they boarded the ship loaded with \u201choney and money.\u201d Now where\u2019s their money at? Why couldn\u2019t you buy a ring??Married by a turkey. Well, she\u2019s a cat, he\u2019s an owl, a rat helped them board the ship, and they got their wedding ring from a pig\u2019s nose. Why not get married by a turkey, who\u2019s wearing pants with a hole for his tail?I hope they disinfected that ring.Seeing them sprawled out on the ground makes me uncomfortable. Like the concept of the book does. That wing peeking out of his sleeve looks like a lightweight, flimsy peacock feather painted gray. That is not the wing of an owl. &that thing couldn\u2019t hold a spoon, much less fly this guy anywhere. But I guess he doesn\u2019t fly. No, he walks everywhere like a man. The word \u201cruncible\u201d should not be in a kid\u2019s book. I don\u2019t even know what that is!I guess we should all be thankful this book just ended off with them dancing by the light of the moon, The moon, The moon,Instead of their wedding night\u2026Can I get an Amen?Some pages were pretty and done well. The pig looked weird. &let's point out the elephant in the room, or in this case the Pussy, this story is just weird. an owl and a cat? how does that work? kind of like in Shrek with donkey and the dragon...hm. my, my, people like pairing animals together, don't they?I love animals, but I don't like making animals into people &dressing them in clothes like people. It's just weird."], ["23 pagesI was supposed to pick out a Golden Book for a baby shower, the one with the oldest publication date wins a prize, so I stumbled across this book and I was so flustered by the title I put it down to think about. I was also turned off by the owl and \u201cpussy\u201d cat marriage I said to my sister how perverted that was and it put an image in my head that wasn\u2019t pleasant. I always find interspecies mating to be perverse, no matter that these two only got married, it still put an image of the two of them together in my head and might give kids the wrong idea that different animals can mate together, or just put kids to thinking about what the babies would be like and just create all kinds of problems. But the copyright date was 82, the oldest, so I ended up buying it days later. The beautiful pictures with all the different colors is what attracted me to the book because they were pretty to look at.Upon reading the book I\u2019m even more convinced I should\u2019ve stayed away from it. One page in particular had me feeling really weird about it. The one where the owl is singing \u201cO lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are! What a beautiful Pussy you are!\u201d Talk about awkward. Even saying it in my head was embarrassing, saying it out loud to my sister, because I just had to share it with her, even more so! I would never read this aloud to anyone else and I certainly can\u2019t give this to a baby. I wish I hadn\u2019t bought it; the pictures do not make up for these terrible word choices. I don\u2019t know what was going on in the 80\u2019s but today we have a different connotation with the word \u201cpussy\u201d and I for one have never and will never call a real cat a pussycat. Oh, this p word I will not use! Then there \u201cto the land where the bong-tree grows.\u201d There again, a bong is not something I want to read about because that\u2019s drug paraphernalia and I wonder if it was back then too. It might be a type of tree but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good idea to use it in a children\u2019s book. Bongs and pussies, just what you want kids repeating! I can\u2019t give this to a baby because I doubt parents would appreciate their kids repeating these words that in today\u2019s world reference drugs and the female body. Then were words that kids just don't know. I never understand when authors use these big words that they know in their adult lives and expect young children to know. Like \"They dined on mince and slices of quince, which they ate with a runcible spoon.\" I can't even follow that! I did like some of the lines, like: \u201cThey sailed away, for a year and a day\u201d and \u201cthey danced by the light of the moon.\u201d All in all, I think this book was for another time but today just brings up awkward subjects."], ["Jan Brett's Caribbean-inspired illustrations for the classic Edward Lear poem are teeming with life, and the effect is stunning. The colors, textures, and shapes are a visual treat. Each page also has a different pattern of \"straw\" border, adorned with a different tropical flower.The pictures overflow with detail, to the point where there's even a sub-story (pardon the pun) involving two yellow fish.I didn't give it the full 5 stars because the way the text is broken up across spreads makes it difficult to read the poem with any kind of flow, and because some of Brett's admittedly gorgeous illustrations could (and perhaps should) have had more of a connection to the text. For one notable example -- there's no pot of honey on the boat, and we never get a look at the money wrapped up in the five-pound note!But there's no denying the beauty of the illustrations, and the Caribbean theme works surprisingly well. This is a great book for anyone -- for newcomers to the splendid silliness of the poem as well as for old fans of the poem who are looking for an edition with fabulous illustrations."]], "review_count": "7", "description": "Edward Lear's nonsense poem about two unlikely sweethearts--an elegant owl and a beautiful cat--has found a perfect match in artist Jan Brett. She traveled to the Caribbean (the land where the Bong-tree grows, perhaps?) to research her illustrations as well as the settings, costume details, plants, and fish native to the area. Readers can follow an illustrated subplot of two yellow fish who also fall in love under the pea-green boat. A charming treatment of a classic children's poem. <i>(Ages 3 to 7)</i>", "author": "Edward Lear"}, "The War": {"average_rating": "3.85", "review": [["Published some forty years after it was written during the liberation of Paris, Marguerite Duras, with a state of mind that is clearly under the influence of paranoia, anguish, and deep worry, writes of her day to day experiences in 1944, during uncertain times in the French capital. Duras apparently found this written account as a diary in a couple of exercise books inside a cupboard, and says,\"I have no recollection of having written it. I know I did. I recognize my own handwriting, details of the story, I can see the place, and various comings and goings. But I can't see myself writing the diary. When would I have done so?, in what year?, at what times of the day?, in what house?I can't remember.\"Asked by a magazine many years later for a text she had penned during her younger days, she confronts herself with a tremendous chaos of thought and feeling to describe 'The War' as a one of the most important things in her life. Duras writes here (like some of her fictional work) using a spare, and almost arid prose, she keeps sentences brief, sometimes only two or three words long. She is continually self-involved, examining emotions and intellectual reactions to emotional states until it feels almost suffocating. It's painful, at least in the first third, which shes her husband (Robert. L) returning from Belsen a mere skeleton, more dead than alive. In fact death and dying is something Duras can't escape from, tormented, believing he will never come back, she thinks of her own death, constantly, in a state of acceptance. The original French title 'La douleur' (Suffering) would have been a far more appropriate title at this point. Nursing her love back from the brink is horrendous in detail, he can't eat properly as the shock to his body could kill him, but needs food and water as to survive, he passes a nauseating liquid waste, that has the foul, God awful stench of decomposition. But Slowly, very slowly, his condition would improve, as the lingering smell of death seems to leave his body. For Marguerite though, the love she once had for her husband, has been ravaged by the war.The rest of the memoir looks at Duras's involvement with the French Resistance network, the brutal Interrogation of a suspected collaborator, and her run in a with the Jew hunter 'Rabier', a sly Gestapo officer who takes a liking to her, but only for his plans of gaining information on colleagues. She plays into his hands, probably for survival, and a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse endures on the streets of Paris. The book is completed with two very short fictional works whilst Duras served in the French Communist Party. 'The Crushed Nettle' is followed by 'Aurelia Paris' (which she was tempted to transpose to the stage) about a young girl hiding out in a tower with an old woman, gun in hand, simply waiting for the German police to knock on the door.Honest, harrowing, and intense, this may not be her best work, but it is no doubt the most truthful and hard-hitting. As a fan of World War Two non-fiction I have read better, but as a Duras purest this was simply a must. For anyone that appreciates her writing it's worth a look, or for that matter an interest in life during WW2. An excellent account of a woman living through hell, but it still lacked some depth with being only 180 pages long."], ["La Douleur = The War, Marguerite Duras La Douleur (War: A Memoir) is a controversial, semi-autobiographical work by Marguerite Duras published in 1985 but drawn from diaries that she supposedly wrote during World War II. It is a collection of six texts recounting a mix of her experiences of the Nazi Occupation of France, with fictional details. She claims to have \"forgotten\" ever writing the diary in which she recorded her wartime experiences, but most critics believe that to be a deliberate attempt to confuse autobiography and fiction. Duras' work is often cited as part of the Nouveau Roman movement which tried to redefine traditional ideas about set categories of books, fiction, non-fiction, biography, autobiography,

Its apologists in the Bush-Cheney administration were eloquent about why it can sometimes be necessary. We were frequently told about ticking time-bombs and the threat of a mushroom cloud over an American city. Some horrifying stories surfaced from people who had been tortured at Guant\u00e1namo, Abu Ghraib, and elsewhere. But, and it just occurs to me now to think how odd this is, I don't recall reading one straightforward account told from the torturer's point of view. If you're curious, you can read one here. Marguerite Duras was a member of the Resistance in wartime France. In Albert des Capitales, one of the pieces in this book, she describes in her usual matter-of-fact way an incident that occurred a few days after the Liberation. She and the other members of her cell are hanging around when a waiter comes running in and says that there's a guy at his bistro who's an informer. Everyone in his home town knows he is. But they'll have to move fast and grab him before he disappears.So they rush into the caf\u00e9 and arrest him. He's an overweight, unhealthy-looking guy in his 50s. He looks kind of dirty and unwashed. They make him empty his pockets. There's a notebook with names and addresses, and every so often the notation ALBERT DES CAPITALES. They want to know what this means. The guy thinks, or pretends to think, and then he says, oh yes, he's a waiter at another caf\u00e9, Les Capitales. He has a drink there sometimes on the way home. Okay, says the leader of the Resistance cell, this must be his contact. We need to start rolling up the network. He immediately sends three people over to arrest Albert, but they come back empty-handed. He left days ago. They figure they'll interrogate the informer anyway. He must be able to tell them something else, and if they wait the trail will go cold. The leader asks Marguerite if she wants to lead the interrogation. Why not, she says.They take the informer into a back room and order him to strip. He takes his clothes off slowly, hanging them up on the back of a chair so they won't get creased. One of the guys tells him to hurry up, they haven't got all day. He apologises and carries on removing his clothes. His underpants and socks are dirty. When he's naked, Marguerite asks him how to find Albert des Capitales. He answers evasively and the guys start hitting him a bit. Then Margurite asks him what he did when he visited the Gestapo headquarters. Nothing special, he says, moaning a bit and rubbing the places where they've hit him. I left my ID card at the door and went up. It was just some black market crap, nothing important.So what color was your card? asks Marguerite, but he won't answer. They hit him, and then they hit him more, and he's bleeding in several places. She asks him again what color his card was, and he still won't answer, so they carry on hitting and kicking him. Several other people have come in to watch. A couple of women say uncertainly that maybe this is enough. The leader says that anyone who thinks it's disgusting is welcome to leave. No one leaves.The informer's screaming and covered in blood as they kick him around like a ball. But he still won't say what color his card was. Marguerite tells him he'd better answer or they'll kill him. It looks like she means it. She tries different possibilities. Was it white? He moans no. Red? Also no. Yellow? No again.In the end, he screams out that it was green. That's the color that means he's an S.D. secret agent. Marguerite tells the guys to stop torturing him and let him put his clothes on. She goes out and sees a woman who'd missed all the fun.He confessed, says Marguerite. So fucking what? shrugs the woman. Marguerite starts crying. We should just let him go, she says. People won't like that, says the cell leader.She didn't get around to publishing this story until 1985. _______________________________________The \"green card\" plays an important role in Simenon's La Neige Etait Sale. It becomes clear that anyone who had a green card was a tool of the Nazi occupiers, and could legitimately be regarded as the worst kind of collaborator and traitor."], ["Reviewed in conjunction with Roughneck by Jim ThompsonSometimes you read a book that makes you feel ashamed of your life, every time you thought you were unlucky or that you deserve more or that you should get more. Whatever you have suffered, however genuine it be, suddenly becomes as nothing, its place clearly fixed in the universe as the measliest dot the world ever has seen. Roughneck does that. It describes a portion of his life in the pared down, straightforward way Thompson tells all his stories. Nothing is oversized, filled with extra words so that you can feel like you are getting more than you paid for. You are, of course. But not in word count. As is so often the case, the small story about a few, packs so much more punch than big numbers. This one starts before the Great Depression and takes us through that period. Not that I should be calling it a story. I groaned when I realised I\u2019d picked up an autobiography, not a novel. Live life, don\u2019t read about others, p-llllease. But I was too mean not to read it, serves me right for not looking carefully when I bought it. And before two pages were up I was goggle-eyed, gaping-mouthed hooked.The man\u2019s a genius. He can even make biography bearable. I\u2019m not going to review this, for the simple reason that I\u2019m not worthy too. The human suffering he writes about, what Americans did to Americans, even white Americans to white Americans, would be demeaned by anything I said about it. I don\u2019t think I ever realised so clearly the extent to which poverty and wealth create the same barriers, the same hate as race or religion, maybe even worse. Watching the way wealthy Americans treated those they were exploiting in this period made my stomach churn. I think that\u2019s the most incredible aspect of it. It is so easy to understand poor people might hate rich. But this book brings home the other side of this and it is truly ghastly to watch.This is a wildy entertaining book, but it is about people who were rich, watching, exploiting and being despicable to their poor neighbours. It is about people unnecessarily half starving, living in the most desperate circumstances and heart in mouth hoping they pull through. It makes you ashamed to be human.So I thought.But then, I hadn\u2019t picked up La Douleur yet.\u2018Shit.\u2019 That is what I did say out loud, irritated when I picked this up, the very next book after Roughneck. Another hasty purchase, another %$^#$ autobiography. A slightly wanky one, if it comes to that, I felt as I started it \u2013 after the plain matteroffactness of Thompson, Duras seemed on the hysterically dramatic side.Then again, who wouldn\u2019t be? Thompson writes about the half starved. Duras writes of the 95% starved. I don\u2019t know how to put that. People who are literally skin and bones as they come back, those few who do, from the camps of Nazi Germany, people who are so close to death that food is going to kill them as surely as lack of it will, people whose skeletons can\u2019t bear the tiny weight on them. I have no way of describing the horrors recorded here and to quote bits and pieces would seem plain disrespectful.I did need some pages to adjust to the girly, introspective way Duras sets out her story here, but then, it was never supposed to be a story, not like that. It was what she wrote at the time for herself, trying to hang on to what was left of her sanity as she waited for her husband to come back during the period in which the prisoners were set free from the Nazi camps. She has some moments of marvelous acidity as she describes how some of the French take advantage of the new political situation. She is no friend of de Gaulle, who sounds like a right creep the way she tells it.It turned out that being ashamed of America in the Depression wasn\u2019t the half of it.Lately I seem to keep on \u2013 completely coincidentally \u2013 reading books that pair each other in some significant way and here again, it\u2019s happened. It\u2019s an odd request, but I\u2019m making it. These books go together. Get them and read them back to back. It\u2019ll be totally worth it, I promise!Afterthought:I went to see de Santiago Amigorena's Another silence recently and it deals, as does Duras, with the issue of revenge. What a fine contrast. The heroine, whose husband and child are murdered, sets about revenge as coldly as does Duras in the story where she talks about torturing a collaborator, but in the end, faced with the perpetrator, a piece of Argentinian trash, she not only can't kill him, but she even grants him a gesture of mercy. The difference? Maybe that in Another Silence she meets the wife and child of the killer of her family. Maybe Duras is able to torture people with the objectivity of principle because her victim doesn't look human.Then again, maybe it is part of her own terrible guilt. It transpires that Duras - all the time she was suffering in such a melodramatic way that she confesses 'D' chastises her and points out she should be ashamed of how she is behaving - is in love with 'D' and planning to tell her husband as soon as she can, if he comes back, that she wants a divorce. No wonder she has to behave as if she is suffering all that he is, even though she can only play at that.I don't think this detracts from the book, it simply adds a layer of human behaviour which may repel the reader, but is no less readable for that."], ["\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0646\u06cc

Perhaps being brave is my form of cowardice.\"I just realized that I have not reviewed this book yet.Part of the reason for my lapse is that there is never anything to say about war. About the Holocaust. About torture. About death.Or rather, there is too much to say that I never know where to begin.Besides Marguerite said it all already in this book.Which is in itself impressive. She says it all in here without falling into the typical trappings of saying it all about such a subject.Without sentimentality. In fact with the opposite of sentimentality.\"There's no point in killing him. And there's no longer any point in letting him live. ... And just because there's no point in killing him, we can go ahead and do it.\"She goes to the very edge of emotional experience and is somehow able to write about it almost as it was going on, and it doesn't turn out like an overly emotional teenager's drivel (I just realized after I wrote this that it may be read as a subtle criticism of Anne Frank, but it's not intended that way, I haven't read her since high school, so can't speak on that front).Part of the reason this is impressive is that to go to the very edge of emotional experience is an entirely different beast than to write out that experience on paper. To affect a reader in that way requires going to a different place inside of oneself after much silence, quite separate from the edge of experience that is experienced while in the midst of experiencing the edge of experience.Duras was able to do that seemingly in the moment. At the edge and not at the edge at the same time. How?Maybe the war divides us, divides our experience, so that we can talk about the missing cheese in the same sentence as we talk about the death of a traitor (as they do in one of the later chapters here).Death and cheese, Duras understood, normally existed on different planes of human experience. But in wartime there is only one plane of human experience. Human experience becomes one dimensional. There are no hierarchies of objects.

Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the liberation, this extraordinary diary by the author of The Lover is \"a haunting portrait of a time and place\" (New York Times).<br /><br />Written in 1944 and first published in 1985, Duras's riveting account of life in Paris during the Nazi occupation and the first months of liberation depicts the harrowing realities of World War II-era France \"with a rich conviction enhanced by [a] spare, almost arid, technique\" (Julian Barnes, The Washington Post Book World). Duras, by then married and part of a French resistance network headed by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand, tells of nursing her starving husband back to health after his return from Bergen-Belsen, interrogating a suspected collaborator, and playing a game of cat and mouse with a Gestapo officer who was attracted to her. The result is \"more than one woman's diary...[it is] a haunting portrait of a time and a place and also a state of mind\" (The New York Times).", "author": "Marguerite Duras"}, "The Ravishing of Lol Stein": {"average_rating": "3.69", "review": [["so there's this chick Lol Stein, a real blank broad, gets ditched by her cougar-lovin' fiance. bitch goes crazy, but the quiet kinda crazy, the kinda crazy you keep to yourself. girl gets married to some musician type. years later, she's a mother of three, living in her old town, and she gets wrapped up in her hottie best friend's life. the best friend is busy giving it up to this prick, a dapper don who works with her husband at the local hospital. Lol gets obsessed with the douchebag. some boring get-togethers happen. Lol spends some time watching the hotel room where the two are busy banging it out. mr douche spends some time wondering what is up with Lol. finally Lol and the ever-curious prick take a long-assed train trip to the place where Lol was first ditched years ago. they sit on the beach a while and talk some bullshit. finally, they bone. the end.so there is an empty vessel. her name is Lol Stein. some say her mind became bent when she was betrayed by her lover; others say her mind was always a blank. Lol is a being who has let form define meaning; she has built her life around ideas such as what should a house and home look like? and how should a wife act, how should a scorned lover feel? Lol begins to be obsessed with her friend's affair... she wants to watch where the two lovers go, she wants to be a silent witness to their acts, she wants to find meaning in the forms of their passion. she wants their passion to fill her. in turn, her friend's lover becomes obsessed with her... he wants to understand what lies beneath that glassy surface, he wants to see his passion reflected upon it. is the nature of their different obsessions simply to be obsessed with the idea of an obsession? is that the nature of passion, of obsession... form eventually becoming meaning?so there is a french writer, Marguerite Duras. her novels are not written in the classic literary form; her works are a part of the Nouveau roman - they are anti-tradition. her novels reject such standbys as narrative, characterization, plot. her novels take the details of the world, the form of her characters' actions, and centralizes them so that these details, these descriptions of form, become the meaning itself. in her focus on these physical details, on the physicality of actions, she could possibly be considered a sensual writer. and yet this distance, this separation of incident from emotion, this focus on dividing intellectual contemplation from emotional reaction, makes her works an often clinical, alienating experience. ironically enough, her novel The Ravishing of Lol Stein is ostensibly about passion and voyeurism and the nature of love, the meaning of obsession, the traps and tricks of perspective and point of view. it is a passionless rendering of the various forms of passion.so there is a reviewer, mark monday, a shallow kind of guy, one with an automatic bias against the intellectualization of sensuality. he finds it distasteful, hollow, unreal. even worse, he finds it to be Not Hot. perhaps he is merely symptomatic of gender essentialism at its most prosaic - a man who responds to visual, sensory outputs like all men supposedly do - the kind of guy who wants visceral activity, sensual description, the kind of dude who is intimately familiar with the pornographic appeal of the extreme close-up detail. he wants it to be real. and so he rejects Duras' frosty attempt to deconstruct the nature of passion and obsession. it leaves him cold.so there is this guy, Mark M_____, he's rather an intellectual sort. he is a thinker. one of his favorite films is Hiroshima Mon Amour, written by Marguerite Duras. he admires the film's ability to position two living, breathing characters as - eventually - something both less and more than human... as archetypes for all lovers, for all individuals seeking meaning in escape, in passion, in the forms that meaning takes, within the at-times obliterating, all-encompassing physicality of each other's arms. he admires Duras' distance. he enjoys her lack of reliance on traditional narrative, plot, and characterization. in particular, he appreciates how, in books like The Ravishing of Lol Stein, the reader can literally pick any random page and, reading that page, understand the meaning of the entire work. each detail is symptomatic of the whole. he loves that.so there was this bookish kid, Mark, who worked in the a/v department (of course) while going to school at ucsd. one evening he was in charge of a special screening of the film Hiroshima Mon Amour, for a class that he was in. unfortunately, Mark was high as a kite and got the reels mixed up... so the viewing audience saw the first part of the film first, the third part of the film second, the second part of the film last. there was not a single complaint from the audience. in class the next day, the students discussed the film - and there was no mention of a narrative breakdown, of a mix-up in reels. the purpose of the film remained clear for the students. each detail within the film distilled the meaning intended by the filmmakers. the narrative order was inconsequential. content did not drive form. characterization was unnecessary. plot was meaningless. meaning was present in each part of the film. each part was a whole. so there was this book, The Ravishing of Lol Stein. it dealt with passion and obsession, and the forms they take, and the meaning of those forms. it dealt with those subjects intellectually, objectively, without heat or emotion. it showed no interest in rendering its characters so that they could be understood empathetically. it left me cold. Duras began to seem rather heartless, rather cruel. but after some time, i began to recall Hiroshima Mon Amour, and what i loved about that film. i began to consider the novel again. i contemplated Duras' challenging themes. i started to admire the novel's distance, its alienation from its own topic. and so i grew to understand its frigid appeal, its sensual lack of earthy sensuality. well, what can i say: sometimes i dig a cold, smart bitch."], ["nope. i do not like marguerite duras. janet flanner, in the new yorker claims that her writing has a \"shine like crystal.\" and that's probably true, if one is observing that it is as pointy and depthless as crystal, as chill and remote, as something that refracts emptily. ooooh duras BURN!!if this is a literary bodice ripper, i gotta say i prefer the crappy contemporary ones. this one isn't even intense with the taut tingling of repression, which also has its place and is something i can appreciate - it doesn't all have to be desperate passions and rending of garments, but this zombie vacuity does nothing for me - nothing nothing nothing. there is nothing at stake here, just people blinking emptily at each other, speaking words with no momentum behind them, frequently non sequiturs so it seems as though they are involved in separate conversations. lack of quotation marks so that when one character will reluctantly, languidly plop out a sentence, you sometimes don't even know which one is speaking, unless there is a back-and-forth, and then you can use context or whatever. but the one isolated word or phrase in a scene when two people are just sitting around existing, who knows who is speaking? who cares? and i am not just pouting because no one but me wanted to read zola for the literary smut portion of our rippings, i swear. i did not like The Lover when i read it, but i had hope nonetheless. this one sounded like it could be interesting. but the french have this habit of creating highly stylized works of art that leave me cold. why do they do that? very infuriating, frenchies...i know all the other rippers will have informed and intelligent things to say about this, and my frazzled and sweaty frustration will be coolly counteracted by more reasonable ladies (and a dude or two) with elegant and refined responses examining the psychology of characters such as these, and what duras is trying to accomplish be portraying them in this way, but i am a monster and i bust down the door and say \"boring boring boring boring!!!\"also, \"boring!!\"now i will go hide. \u2665"], ["Working my way through the novels of Marguerite Duras, I kept thinking, sooner or later one will eventually lead to disappointment, it could have been this, it wasn't. For again she has hit me in the most painful of places, the heart.The Ravishing of Lol Stein, in simple terms is a love story, but those who are familiar with her work will know she writes in a stark, minimal style, with short sentencing, but done in a most profoundly haunting way. There are three main viewpoints, looking in from the outside, yes it's a tale of love, but also a voyeuristic mystery, and a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Who is the person behind the mystery voice that\u2019s narrating The Ravishing of Lol Stein?, one of the first things I asked myself, as the story focuses almost entirely on the passions of the central characters and on the narrator\u2019s attempts to understand the history of the enigmatic Lol. Stripped of climax and denouement, the story elevates memory and sexual tension over physical action.Lol Stein, is a reserved young woman, engaged to wed but at a ball, her love abandons Lol for a mysterious older woman, Lol is left in the hands of friend Tatiana to help comfort her. Later in a state of depression Lol meets a man, John Bedford, who is immediately intrigued by her, hence, they fall in love, start a family and move away.After ten years they return, but yearning for past sorrows grips Lol, who takes to meandering long walks to ponder on her heartbroken youth and reminisce about that tragic night when all was lost.After time she would take to following a women she recognized, which would lead her to another man whist spying in a hotel window, but as Lol takes to voyeurism, but unknown to her, the narrator is also following. With a deft and slender touch each page feels like you are in the presence of a wondering ghost, but not from a physical form, and with some painfully beautiful sentences, reminiscent of 'The Lover or 'Hiroshima Mon Amour', this is Duras during her peak. I am now more optimistic for the rest of her lesser known writings, as yet, she has never let me down."], ["424.\tLe Ravissement de Lol V. Stein = The Ravishing of Lol V. Stein = The rapture of Lol V. Stein, Marguerite DurasLe ravissement de Lol V. Stein is a novel written by Marguerite Duras and published in France by Gallimard in 1964. The text was translated by Richard Seaver and published as The Ravishing of Lol Stein in the US by Grove Press in 1966. The text was also translated by Eileen Ellenbogen in the UK as The rapture of Lol V. Stein for Hamish Hamilton in 1967.At the beginning of the novel, Lol Stein (her middle initial is omitted in the English translation) is a woman in her thirties. She was born and raised in South Tahla in a bourgeois family and is engaged to Michael Richardson at 19. However, at a ball in the seaside resort of Town Beach, Michael Richardson leaves Lol for Anne-Marie Stretter, an older woman. After a difficult recovery from this shock, Lol marries John Bedford, a musician she meets on one of her daily walks. Lol leaves South Tahla with her husband. Ten years later, with three children, Lol is an established woman with no time for fantasy. She returns with her family to South Tahla and moves into the house she grew up in. Lol goes on her daily walks as she did ten years before. She thinks she recognises Tatiana Karl one day, the friend who consoled her after her breakup with Michael Richardson. The man who accompanies Tatiana makes a deep impression on Lol. Lol reestablishes her contact with Tatiana and gets to know both her husband and her lover, Jacques Hold. Lol is able to get information from Jacques about events at the ball at T Beach 10 years before. Lol reveals to Jacques her interest in him but forbids him to stay with her instead of Tatiana. Lol spies on Tatiana and her lover but Jacques notices her. One day Lol tells Jacques that she has been to T Beach alone and plans to return with him. While doing this, Lol shows Jacques the room where she and Michael Richardson had split up. Lol and Jacques spend the night together. The next day, Jacques has one last meeting with Tatiana Karl. \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634:

truly think or feel? how can we know? -- moves this smoothly out of the actual and into the metaphysical. Beautifully, destroyingly. Duras' prose is a tension system of concepts in deadly suspension, but this one seems to occur at a pivot-point. Five years later, of Destroy, She Said, Duras would say something like \"I'm so sick of plots, all the telling what happened, I can't stand it anymore\" and proceed to continuously strip away and refine her systems into gleaming singularities. Many of them, at least. Not that she didn't apply a rigorous minimalism to plenty of earlier works as well, but there were also actions and plot movements in stories like 10:30 on a Summer's Night, in here, where scenes repeat with the full force of any of her constructions, while interacting in a larger, more elaborate system. The early chapters create an inciting conflagration and then analyze it into obscurity and shadow, an obscurity amplified by distance of interpretation. Then time and perspective shift into a greater immediacy (with its own ambiguities) and a series of mounting aftershocks that never bring a release from the tightening tension-coils that grip every word.Here, just listen:What would have happened? Lol does not probe very deeply into the unknown into which this moment opens. She has no memory, not even an imaginary one, she has not the faintest notion of this unknown. But what she does believe is that she must enter it, that that was what she has to do, that it would always have meant, for her mind as well as her body, both their greatest pain and their greatest joy, so commingled as to be undefinable, a single entity but unnamable for lack of a word. I like to believe--since I love her--that if Lol is silent in daily life, it is because, for a split second, she believed that this word might exist. Since it does not, she remains silent. It would have been an absence-word, a hole-word, whose center would have been hollowed out into a hole, the kind of hole in which all other words would have been buried. It would have been impossible to utter, it would have been made to reverberate. Enormous, endless, an empty gong, it would have held back anyone who wanted to leave, it would have convinced them of the impossible, it would have made them deaf to any other word save that one, in one fell swoop it would have defined the moment and the future themselves. By its absence this word ruins all the others, it contaminates them, it is also the dead dog on the beach at high noon, this hole of flesh. How were other words found? Hand-me-downs from God knows how many love affairs like Lol Stein's, affairs nipped in the bud, trampled upon, and from massacres, oh! you've no idea how many their are, how many blood-stained failures are strewn along the horizon, piled up there, and, among them, this word, which does not exist, is nonetheless there: it awaits you just around the corner of language, it defies you--never having been used--to raise it, to make it arise from its kingdom, which is pierced on every side and through which flows the sea, the sand, the eternity of the ball in the cinema of Lol Stein."], ["Reading this book is like sitting beside a sleepy tranquil lake on one lazy Sunday afternoon. You appreciate the serene surroundings, the chirping birds, the blowing gentle breeze, the scent of the trees mixed with the water. You then see a small boat docked by the lake side and decide to have do some rowing. Unknown to you, there is a lake \u201cloch\u201d monster silently stirring below the lake and at anytime will pop out the water and will eat you alive.My first book by Marguerite Duras (1914-1996), a French writer and film director. Definitely not to be my last. Her writing is captivating not because of the usual lyrical prose but the short staccato phrases give you that feeling of immediacy and danger. That feeling will make you continuously leaf the pages till the end of the book. You want to know the end and make sure that you are out of the water when the loch monster pops out.This is a story of Lol V. Stein who at 19 is engaged to marry 22-y/o Michael Richardson, only heir of a rich couple. One night in a ball, Michael meets an older widower, Anne-Marie Stretter. Michael ditched Lol. Hurt and with her heart broken, Lol goes to another town and meets musician Jean Bedford. They get married and bear children. After 10 years, Lol and her family return to the town. Lol meets her former friend Tatiana Karl who now has a lover Jacques Hold but childless. Jacques is the narrator of the story.The story reminded me of a woman in our island-town who was said to be ditched by her fianc\u00e9 few days before they were supposed to get married. Since the day she was ditched, she did not get outside the house. She did get down to the lower floor only to bring up water from their water pump. The island-town, even up to now, has no water system. Our family had a well but it is not suitable for drinking. So, me and my brothers were the ones who fetched water from their pump that is located across the back of our house. I was still very young, or maybe not born yet, when the ditching happened. I only heard the story from my mother (as usual, she knows all the lives of people in the island). As a young boy, whenever I saw the old lady by the stairs or the pump, I used to marvel at her feet: so white, so clean, delicate-looking and thought that maybe that was how my dirty boy feet would look like if I did not go outside the house for the rest of my life. I never had the courage to talk to her, my being a shy provincial boy. However, that old woman sort of became a legend among us boys: a woman who was betrayed by her lover and chose not to show her face to the world for the rest of her life.We went through all that: we all had our unrequited love or simply ditched by someone who used to love us. How did we react? This novel, The Ravishing of Lol Stein has another title depending on the edition: The Rapture of Lol Stein. Yes, she has been hurt that much that she leads an dull but seemingly painless life. The pain of being ditched is inside her but she has, or chooses not to have, no outlet to express the pain. The trauma of losing her lover is something that stays with her forever. Funny thing is that, at first, I thought that \"rapture\" is the same as \"rupture\" so I thought that the voyeurism that Lol Stein does in the story is her rupture because of the bottled pain in her heart or her \"pocketbook\" (if I may borrow the term of Mary Angelou in I Know Why the Caged Birds Sing)But that old woman with white clean feet? When half of the town got burned in 1984, she had no choice but to come out because the house with the pump where she lived and where we used to get clean drinking water? It got burned. Unfortunately, I was not there because I was in college in the city so I did not see how she managed to walk on the street with many people seeing her scared face for the first time."], ["Duras\u2019 writing is like taking a slow drug\u2014something woozy and disorienting, a little foggy yet intensifying, slowing down time here, speeding it up there. Her style is fluid and incantatory; a hypnotic movement of memory and breath, a watercolor swirl of feelings on the surface of a lake that at first glance appears calm and neutral, but underneath something bubbles up, the premonition of a storm, and while reading I am waiting and waiting for that storm to break, for all the silt being churned up in the depths to come spewing out, for something real and undeniable to emerge. And does it? Does one true feeling ever burst through the overriding numbness, does Duras make good on all her romantic-obsessive meandering to show us what or who has been driving the boat, do we ever get a chance to see the characters unveil themselves completely, do we know anything or anyone by the end?Hm.Duras is masterful at creating tension, setting the stage for drama with a playwright\u2019s deft hand at direction, except she is describing the inner stage, the invisible feelings and motivations playing out in each character, which our narrator intuits or invents. In many ways this narrator seemed to be incidental, a figment of everyone\u2019s imagination, including the reader\u2019s, there only to physically inhabit the landscape, to serve as a grounding \u201cI/eye,\u201d but amorphous and permeable as a phantom, occupying other characters and turning a third-person view on himself with a kind of eerie remove. I admire the confidence with which Duras sweeps her reader along, never stopping to check in and see how windblown the reader is, just coaxing and continuing, single-pointed through the fog.The narrator wants Lol to \u201cconsume and crush me with the rest\u2026to be bent to her will\u201d (97), but WHY I kept asking myself, Why Why WHY? Here is where my reactions started getting personal. I recalled in my own writing how tempting it was to write myself into a tragic, numbed-out yet obsessively compelling woman character, enigmatic and evasive, beautiful in her absolute impenetrability. The term that kept coming up for me related to this portrait was \u201cself-indulgent.\u201d Duras\u2019 characters talk about love, but I don\u2019t see any of them actually feeling it. I didn\u2019t get any real sense of the link between Tatiana and Lol\u2014I got that Lol played out the projected madness and alienation the other characters (Jack and Tatiana) felt within, but I didn\u2019t ever fully buy into the melodramatic intensity under which these characters lived. Perhaps I would have done better with more of a social context, something bigger to draw from than just this triadic world of disconnect and yearning and repression\u2026And yet I also get that this was the intent, to show the self-absorption of these lives, independent of any greater story arc or historical context, just these roiling, voyeuristic, emotional beings captured and liberated by Lol\u2019s tragic stoicism. I kept feeling myself drawn along the thread of some mystery, the answer to which (the cause of Lol\u2019s madness, the truth behind the breakdown at the ball, etc) would be revealed at the end. But it wasn\u2019t, really. And maybe this too was the point. But by the last line I realized I didn\u2019t really care about any of them. They all seemed to me like actors, entertaining themselves with shows of dramatic intensity fit for the stage. And viewed from the audience, it\u2019s intriguing\u2014but, as it struck me, egotistical. Obviously struck a chord for me to look at more closely in my own work\u2026"], ["I shall not have to read it at the same time as Proust. Her style appears in all its artificiality. A kind of clinical and cold manierism. The distance which the writing puts with regard to the character disembody them. They are reduced to the state of arch\u00e9tipaux skeletons. And the history is of an exceptional foolishness. Harlequin in the Nouveau Roman. To flee."], ["I can feel a Marguerite Duras fixation coming on.While fairly impressed with her late novel \nL'amant de la Chine du nord\n, I wasn't completely drawn into Duras's milieu until David and I watched Hiroshima mon amour, the 1959 Alain Resnais film for which she wrote the screenplay. To put it bluntly, Hiroshima mon amour blew. me. away. The opening sequence reduced me to sobs, overlaying Emmanuelle Riva's and Eiji Okada's stark, dreamlike narration (a stylized argument, which at times seems almost to veer into poetic verse, about whether or not Riva's character has or has not \"seen\" the devastation of Hiroshima) with footage of said devastation and of the hospital and museum Riva's character mentions. And the film as a whole raised fascinating questions about authenticity, storytelling, trauma, and the ability of humans to connect and empathize. Since Duras' 1964 novella Le ravissement de Lol V. Stein shares many of these same preoccupations, I thought I would attempt to write about them together, even though I know that I will be overwhelmed with material!Both Hiroshima and Ravissement, then, are deeply concerned with the extent to which it is (im)possible to step inside another person's experience. In the opening scene of the film, Riva's character (known simply as \"elle\" or \"her\") makes a repeated claim to have witnessed the events of nuclear devastation in Hiroshima, not at first hand but through visits to bomb victims in the hospital, trips to the museum, and viewings of the newsreels. As she amplifies on her experiences, speaking in mesmerizing circuits of repeated words, Eiji Okada's character \"lui\"/\"him\" occasionally interrupts her to deny her authority: \"Tu n'as rien vu \u00e0 Hiroshima.\" (\"You saw nothing at Hiroshima.\") So did she? It's a complicated question. On one hand, some of her claims are quite radical:J'ai eu chaud, Place de la Paix. Dix mille degr\u00e9s sur la Place de la Paix. Je le sais. La temperature du soleil sur la Place de la Paix - comment l'ignorer?\nI was hot in Peace Square. Ten thousand degrees in Peace Square. I know it. The temperature of the sun in Peace Square - how could you not know it?\nObviously, this Frenchwoman can only \"know\" that the temperature in Peace Square reached ten thousand degrees in the way one knows a fact from a history textbook: with her brain rather than her body. Likewise there is a world of difference between visiting an interpretive museum exhibit, even an extremely well-constructed one, and \"knowing\" an event through first-hand knowledge either personal or cultural. On the other hand, her empathy just as obviously exceeds the theoretical: watching those newsreels and museum exhibits really has imbued her with some part of the horror of the situation. In fact, as a viewer watching the scenes of devastation ourselves, we are in the exact same situation. Resnais and Duras make us question Elle's claims to understanding, even as they put us in an extreme position of identification with her. After all, if I am sobbing as I watch this film (which I was), how can I fully dismiss the power of simulacrums to convey experience? As she herself acknowledges later on, we as outside observers are limited in our ability to both feel and act: \"On peut toujours se moquer. Mais que peut faire d'autre un touriste, que justement pleurer?\" / \"You can always scoff. But what else can a tourist do, but weep?\" Later on in the film, Riva's character is possessive about her own traumatic war-time experience; her Japanese lover can listen and feel pain, but he can't truly understand. Le ravissement de Lol V. Stein, too, questions the ability of any person to tell the story of another's trauma\u2014or even to claim absolute certainty about what that trauma was in the first place. Lola Valerie Stein (self-styled Lol V.) remains a cypher throughout the novella, which is narrated by her eventual lover, Jacques Hold. Jacques meets Lol through another lover of his, Tatiana Karl, an old school friend of Lol's who was present on the night, ten years before, which directly preceded Lol's mental breakdown. Exactly what precipitated this breakdown remains a subject of contention throughout the novella: while it's clear that Lol and her fianc\u00e9 both met an older woman that night, and that the fianc\u00e9 left with said woman as dawn was breaking, Lol's emotions at each step of the evening are puzzling, as is her present relationship to the past. For example, Tatiana recalls that for most of the dance Lol didn't seem to mind her fianc\u00e9 being enamored of another woman, sitting calmly throughout the evening until the couple left the ballroom without her. Was she ever in love with her fianc\u00e9? Was she in love with the woman who replaced her in his affections? Was she in love with some mental image of the couple together, and herself as an observer of their love? Was she teetering on the brink of mental disaster the whole time, and this night was merely the straw that broke the camel's back of her mind?Tatiana is invested in one version of past events, and Lol\u2014uncommunicative, shocky, and prone to telling bizarre, easily-detectable lies\u2014is of little use as a witness. Jacques himself is all too aware of his inability to fathom Lol's inner world; not only was he not present on the famous night of the ball, but Tatiana, who was there, disagrees about whether it's even the crucial event in Lol's past. She feels that Lol has always been missing some crucial component, that her \"self\" has always been somehow absent, and that the seeds of her breakdown were present since long before the night at T. Beach.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Je lui ai demand\u00e9 si la crise de Lol, plus tard, ne lui avait pas apport\u00e9 la preuve qu'elle se trompait. Elle m'a r\u00e9pet\u00e9 que non, qu'elle, elle croyait que cette crise et Lol ne faisaient qu'un depuis toujours.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Je ne crois plus \u00e0 rien de ce que dit Tatiana, je ne suis convaincu de rien.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked her if Lol's breakdown, later on, didn't prove to her that she had been wrong. She repeated that no, that she, she believed that this attack and Lol had always been one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I no longer believe in anything Tatiana says, I'm not convinced of anything.\nThus not only do we have competing accounts of what happened inside Lol while she watched her fianc\u00e9 fall for another woman, we have a debate about whether it even matters. Tatiana and Jacques are also unsure of the degree to which Lol has recovered from her breakdown: the slick surfaces of her immaculately-maintained home and marriage seem to indicate \"recovery,\" yet Tatiana at least is invested in the idea of Lol's continuing malady. And what is that malady in the first place? It becomes clear that Lol is, for some reason and in some way, obsessed with her past, but what is she remembering and experiencing when she thinks of it?This brings up another commonality between Ravissement and Hiroshima, which is a preoccupation with memory and forgetting, and the pain involved in inevitably forgetting something one had sworn to remember. In the film, Riva's character gestures at this idea with the statementDe m\u00eame que dans l'amour, cette illusion existe, cette illusion de pouvoir jamais oublier, de m\u00eame j'ai eu l'illusion devant Hiroshima, que jamais je n'oublierai. De m\u00eame que dans l'amour.\nJust as in love, this illusion exists, this illusion of never being able to forget, I had the illusion when confronted with Hiroshima, that I would never forget it. Just as in love.\nBut the inability to forget\u2014or more accurately, the ability to never forget, to remember forever, is just that: an illusion. Even as these characters are haunted by an inescapable relationship to their past traumas (to the point where several people identify each other as synonymous with those traumas), what dwells inside them is not precisely \"memory\" but an ever-changing set of reference points combining past, present, potential and imaginary. When Lol moves back to the town of S. Tahla after ten years away, for example, her memories of the town seem to start out sharp, not having been added to much in the intervening years, but soon they become eroded through frequent applications of new experience. [E]lle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre moins, puis diff\u00e9rement, elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 retourner jour apr\u00e8s jour, pas \u00e0 pas vers son ignorance de S.

De la distance invariable du souvenir elle de dispose plus: elle est l\u00e0. Sa pr\u00e9sence fait la ville pure, m\u00e9connaissable. Elle commence \u00e0 marcher dans le palais fastueux de l'oubli de S. Tahla.\nShe began to recognize less, then differently, she began to return day after day, step by step towards her ignorance of S. Tahla.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This spot in the world where they say she lived her past grief, this alleged grief, is little by little erased from her memory by her corporeality. Why these places rather than others? Wherever Lol finds herself, it is as though she is there for the first time. She no longer positions herself at the unvarying remove of memory: she is there. Her presence renders the city pure, unknowable. She begins to walk in the sumptuous palace of forgetting S. Tahla.\nThus being back in her home town erodes Lol's past knowledge of it, just as she seems unable to see again the shapes of her past self and her former fianc\u00e9 when she revisits T. Beach at the end of the novel. Her attempts to reenact the past with a new cast of characters, and force it to provide her with something that was missing the first time around, are dream-like and fascinating, asking similar questions and evoking a similar mood to the relationship between \"Elle\" and \"Lui\" in Hiroshima mon amour. I am eager to read more Duras from this period; where should I start? Moderato Cantabile? L'apr\u00e8s-midi de M. Andesmas? Recommendations very much welcome. In the meantime, both Le ravissement de Lol V. Stein and Hiroshima mon amour come very highly recommended."], ["This book has haunted me since I first read it three years ago. I remembered so well the feeling I had while reading this the first time, lethargic and removed from reality, as if a veil had fallen between myself and the rest of the world, the edges of everything having gone soft and blurry, and that same sensation came flooding back as I read a second time. Additionally, this second reading made me slightly restless, not from boredom but from a subtle anxiety emanating from the pages, growing more substantial as the story moves inexorably to its conclusion. The multiple layers disguised by the apparent simplicity of the writing, Duras' lyrical style, and the dreamlike quality that infuses the very pages are part of what makes this so memorable for me. Something about it touches oh so very lightly some dark, inner place while you read, just brushes it enough to remind you what's hidden in the recesses of the mind, passions, and body.While some have complained that very little happens within The Ravishing of Lol Stein, I vehemently disagree. While there are plenty of \"things\" that happen - the first meeting, the dinner party, the nights at the hotel, and Lol and Jack's trip at the end - those things all feel as if they aren't even really happening, there's such a dream quality to them. The events have been pared down to almost an outline of a scene, with all the empty spaces filled with the muted, warped inner workings of the characters as presented by the unreliable narration. It's quite easy to look back over the story and have those things slip the readers mind. The true action is in the characters themselves, their stilted interactions and personal motives, the fluid way they react to one another, slipping and sliding past as each changes and responds. That's Duras' focus, what she's presenting to the reader as important. Plenty happens there, more than can be picked up in a single reading, but it's so understated it might be easy to miss.I love this book so much, and I can't even explain why, not in any satisfactory way. It's simply my response to it, so base and visceral, the twisting in my gut and the way my breathing would break as I read.

The letters of the alphabet are linked together through the illustrations on the open pages. Professional Recommendation/Review #1: Karin Snelson (Booklist, Aug. 1, 2005 (Vol. 101, No. 22)) Caldecott Honor artist MacDonald has adapted and illustrated Edward Lear's beloved 1871 nonsensical alphabet.This engaging read-aloud is certainly fun; Lear's adapted jolly singsong alphabet goes Technicolor with Eric Carle-style cut paper collage illustrations, mostly of friendly-looking animals. Unfortunately, however, some of the oomph has been extracted from the wonderfully quirky, time-tested poem. The Great King Xerxes entry, so mighty and intriguing in the original, is replaced by a more milquetoast rhyme about an ox (and no, ox is does not start with x.) Cat replaces Lear's cake with a string of adjectives (catty, batty, matty, catty) instead of the clever, action-oriented \"caky / baky / maky / caky / taky / caky, Little-cake!\" Pump replaces pig, unicorn replaces urn, and zebra replaces zinc, as if children won't be intrigued by objects they may have never seen. Poetry purists, reach instead for Vladimir Radunsky's An Edward Lear Alphabet. Nonpurist book lovers and preschool storytime readers, embrace this colorful introduction to Lear's classic poem.Professional Recommendation/Review #2:Tina Dybvik (Children's Literature) These read-aloud nonsense rhymes are a nice introduction to birds and animals with a few inanimate objects also thrown in (including the title of the rhyme). This is a classic alphabet book with no story line. It is all about fun with pictures and words. Hand-painted illustrations appear on every page in primary colors that appeal to young children. Preschoolers will recognize common images like cats and dogs and learn about less familiar creatures like eels and quail. The list-filled poems are easy to memorize and encourage reading alone, and a string of rhyming words on every page-- nesty, besty, zesty, nesty --promotes sounding out of the first letter. It is a nice book for teachers to place in their reading centers, or for grandparents to have on hand when the kids come to visit. There is not much to dislike in this classic text, and MacDonald s illustrations are sure to please.Response to Two Professional Reviews:Both of these reviews touch upon the fact that the book makes great use of animals to help illustrate letters. Children seem to have an innate interest in animals of all shapes and sizes, and using them to help teach letters could be a powerful tool. Both reviews also touch upon the illustrations in the book and how they contribute a positive, playful atmosphere to the book. The reviews differ however, on how they feel the string of rhyming words on every page impacts the reader. Snelson writes that Macdonald took away from the original rhymes, while Dybvik writes that the words add to the book. Evaluation of Literary Elements:This book was written with its audience in mind. The author knows that this is a book to help young students try to grasp the abstract concept of words being represented on a page, and the style is kept simple to accommodate this task. The rhyming sequences on each page are an interesting addition. Using these, you could teach your children about rhyming and they could also work on sounding words out as the ending of each word is the same. Because the ending of each word in the sequence is the same, it frees up the child\u2019s mind to focus on just the first letter and what sound it makes. As with any alphabet book, the plot is minimal as to make sure the children are focusing on the letters and aren\u2019t distracted by anything else. Consideration of Instructional Application:This story would be ideal for young children, I would say mostly kindergarten or preschool aged. One lesson the teacher could possibly carry out would be giving the children cut outs of the letters and having each child raise their letter when the book got to them. Additionally, each child could draw what their letter corresponds to after reading the book which could help the child with letter identification."], ["Title: A was once an Apple PieAuthor: Edward LearIllustrator: Suse MacdonaldGenre: Alphabet book, Concept bookTheme(s): animals, alphabet, and poetryOpening line/sentence: A was once an apple pie, pidy, widy, tidy, pity, nice insidy, apple pie.Brief Book Summary: This book goes through the letters of the alphabet.

(3) PS Adapted by Suse MacDonald. This adaptation of Lear's alphabet ditty retains most of the original verses but adds more animals and changes some unfamiliar words (e.g., Lear's urn is now a unicorn). Purists may complain, but others will enjoy this updated version of Lear's silly-sounding nonsense rhyme. MacDonald's eye-catching cut-paper illustrations are set on dramatic white space. Professional Recommendation/Review #2: (Publishers weekly)A was once an apple pie, / pidy/ widy/ tidy/ nice insidy/ Apple pie.\u201d SO begins Lear\u2019s alphabet, a beguiling collection of verses that stretch poetry, language and meaning but wisely opt for silliness instead of outright nonsense. The result is a rhythmic, lilting progression full of simple, childlike image and the illustrations are a happy match, containing hints of whimsy that complement without overpowering the playfulness of the rhymes. They have a clean crisp, yet varied design and a quietly folksy feel. Ages 2-up. Response to Two Professional Reviews: Both reviews talk about the silliness of Lear\u2019s rhyme schemes. I agree, this book is a great way to introduce the Alphabet to children. It takes the an original concept and adds images, animals, and words that will make a student want to flip to the next page. Evaluation of Literary Elements: This book is clearly designed for young readers. The letters on each page are bolded to help show the book is an alphabet book. The illustrations are realistic, big and bright. All three of those attributions are what makes this a great fit for younger readers. The rhyme schemes are silly, but do not take away from learning the letters. Consideration of Instructional Application: This book could be used in two different ways. The first way is to introduce the alphabet to young children. The other way this book could be used in schools is to teach students about rhymes schemes. Each letter has it\u2019s own rhyme scheme in addition to being the first letter of the animal on the page."], ["Handpainted cut paper artwork by Caldecott winner Suse Macdonald illustrates this stunning adaptation of Edward Lear's classic ABC rhyme.A was once an apple pie,PiedyWideyTidyPiedyNice insidey, APPLE PIE!Suse MacDonald adapts Edward Lear's fun-to-say, alphabet rhyme in a picture book that combines the classic with the up-to-date.

Both an author and an illustrator, he earned his living as an artist from the age of 15, mainly by doing landscapes. What he is remembered for is his nonsense books, especially his popularization of the limerick. Along with Lewis Carroll, he is considered to be the founder of nonsense poetry.In addition to his limericks, he created longer nonsense poems. The best---and best known---is The Jumblies, in which the title characters go to sea in a sieve; it is a brilliant, profound, silly, and sad expression of the need to leave the security of the known world and experience the wonder and danger of the unknown. His other most notable work is The Owl and the Pussy Cat, a less complex poem whose title characters also go to sea. Lear produced humorous alphabets and botany books as well.His wordplay, involving puns, neologisms, portmanteau words, and anticlimax, retains its vitality today and has influenced such contemporary writers of children's nonsense verse as Shel Silverstein, Ogden Nash, and Laura Richards.Subject:Children's poetry, AmericanEnglish poetry"]], "review_count": "51", "description": "Hand painted cut paper artwork by Caldecott winner Suse MacDonald illustrates this adaptation of Edward Lear's classic ABC rhyme.", "author": "Edward Lear"}, "Cockfighter": {"average_rating": "4.11", "review": [["*3.5 Stars*The interesting thing about this book is that it is essentially the classic underdog sports story that is popular in a lot of movies, television, and books, but instead of focusing on a football player or boxer, it's about a man who trains chickens to fight to the death. It's told from the point of view of Frank Mansfield, a respected cockfighter who, at the books opening, loses all of his money, his car, his mobile home, and his ace cock Sandspur after being defeated by his rival. Now, with only a few bucks in his pocket and the clothes on his back, we witness him doggedly work his way to the top, in his pursuit of the Cockfighter of the Year Award.Frank isn't the best of guys and is, for all intents and purposes, an asshole.

It's actually pretty inspiring, but it's also pretty sad as he shuns and alienates many people who love him in his pursuit of his dream. We even find him years into a vow of silence he's taken until he wins the award. This level of passion is what drives the novel. It's hard to see a guy so dedicated and not root for him to win. Also, the level of detail in depicting the world of Southern cockfighting is staggering.

There's not really much else to the story, which surprised me after reading both \nPick-up\n and \nWild Wives\n from Willeford, both of which felt anything but traditional.

I was impressed by Charles Willeford's ability twenty-two years after his death to explore the competitive milieu of peen-pic texting. There is a whole subculture surrounding this primeval sport in which grown men digitize their dangle not merely to woo the female of the species but to compete against each other in those bloody, bread-and-circuses arenas known as celebrity-dong blogs. Is Favre's prize cock---with its saintly Mexican name Intercepcion---able to survive in the ring against the chanticleer of Kanye West (named Gold Digger, natch)? What are the odds that the fallen-from-grace QB can redeem himself by defeating the prodigious genital proboscis of Santonio Holmes or Greg Oden, just two of the trou-dropping athletes in recent months to go full wang-dang-doodle?But perhaps most impressive are the strange rituals by which men gild their otherwise tumescent lilies to gain a competitive edge. Who knew that Favre takes a razor-blade to his Sandspur to carve grooves into it to give the appearance it\u2019s more battle-scarred than it really is, thus raising the odds against him? Who knew of how underhandedly bettors themselves will break into the training routines of poor Grady Sizemore\u2014whose name couldn\u2019t be more Dickensian than Dickens\u2019 own in this context\u2014to size up his chances for taking his arch (and decidedly curved) enemy, Little David? It\u2019s this wealth of detail that makes Willeford\u2019s second-best book after The Burnt Orange Heresy so authoritative.Of course, being pulp, there has to be some stock characters and impotent plotting. The femme fatale in this case is the fetching and onomatopoetically ominous Michelle Metro, who must keep Brett from leaving the business because she sells cockfighting magazines for Amazon.com. She\u2019s hott for sure, but the world of the testicular wattle isn\u2019t for women. The story structure is also delightfully shambolic, a byproduct of the days when you cranked out a novel in thirty days to pay your electricity bill (and to buy some pube straightener). In this case, the hero is one minute a master of his chosen domain name, only to become out of nowhere a talented mother-guitar-plucker in an episodic excursion that seems included only because that\u2019s where the author\u2019s narrative rod led him. There\u2019s also a weird and wholly misplaced subplot about a shady pharmaceutical flim-flam man\u2014probably a veiled Viagra allegory, is my guess. But in the end you forgive these structural flaws because they give the hero dimension and keep him from seeming past his prime after twenty-some seasons in the cocking leagues. In the end, that\u2019s what we love: a beautiful loser who knows he\u2019s no hero. Someone who probably understands a 31-3 castration by his former teammates is a sign from the gods that he\u2019s wilted beyond repair.

There isn't much of a plot as there is an episodic account of a top tier cockfighter's journey in and around Florida in the early 70's in his pursuit to qualify for a huge cockfighting tournament where he hopes to win the Cockfighter of the Year award. You get to ride along as our hero deals with losing everything in the opening chapters, to chasing down old debts, running into old girlfriends, running into new girlfriends, and acquiring a new partner all in the space of a few months. You also learn a lot about cockfighting along the way. It's the kind of novel I really like because it's so different.

How often can you tell people that you are reading a first person narrative of a voluntarily mute cockfighter? It's incredibly well written, and never what I anticipated. Frank Mansfield is an arsehole, one hundred percent, almost Reacher-esque in his sad white man wish fulfilment nature, always right, always better than anyone else he comes in contact with, and complete with Sam Allardyce levels of hubris that I felt sure this would be an unreliable narrator who gets his comeuppence come the final chapter. And yet he is such a good window in to this entirely alien world and lifestyle, and me with my own collection of hens too. I've seen the Warren Oates movie thanks to some fine fellow on this website sending me a copy but I can't remember much of this book being in it. Both are highly enjoyable entertainment in their own right however."], ["Charles Willeford's villains are tough, self-assured and manly men who are convinced about their own uniqueness. They also have a sneering contempt for ordinary life and people who in their opinion are ordinary. Here is Frederick.J Fenger, Jr reacting to his newly acquired girlfriend's ambition to buy a Burger King franchise in MIAMI BLUES - \"I can't see any point to hanging around a Burger King all day, no matter how much money you make. .... I'll tell you why. Your life would depend on the random desires of people who wanted a hamburger. So you can just forget about Burger King\". Or Troy Louden in SIDESWIPE - \"Smoking comforts ordinary men, but I'm not an ordinary man. There aren't many like me left. And it's a good thing for the world that there isn't. There'll always be a few of us in America in every generation. Because only a great country like America can produce men like me. I'm not a thinker, I'm a doer.\"And here is Frank Mansfield in COCKFIGHTER - \"It is a funny thing. A man can make a promise to his God, break it five minutes later and never think about it. With an idle shrug of his shoulders, a man can break solemn promises to his mother, wife or sweetheart, and, except for a slight momentary twinge of conscience, he still won't be bothered very much. But if a man ever breaks a promise to himself he disintegrates. His entire personality and character crumble into tiny pieces, and he is never the same man again.I remember very well a sergeant I knew in the army. Before a group of five men he swore off smoking forever. An hour later he sheepishly lit a cigarette and broke his vow to the five of us and to himself. He was never quite the same man again, not to me, and not to himself.\" Frank Mansfield is the main character in COCKFIGHTER. But he is almost like a villain, tough as an axe, contemptuous of women, intensely judgmental of his fellow men - basically a man who would not take a backward step to anyone or anything. The novel is his internal soliloquy after he takes a vow of silence in a year where he aims at winning the COCKFIGHTER OF THE YEAR award. There are vivid and violent descriptions of cockfighting matches and the effort that goes into training cocks. It is almost like a bible or even a documentary for/about cock fighters. As usual, Willeford goes into minor details of monetary transactions and how much the main character spends. Money is an obsession for nearly all the characters in Willeford novels and the ones in COCKFIGHTER are no different. As Willeford wrote in HONEY GAL - \"Money is the root of all goodness. To talk disparagingly about money is the privilege of those who have money. There are also those people who state matter-of-factly that \"money isn't everything\". This statement is also true, but only so long as one has money.\" I almost gave this novel a 5, it is one of the best books I've read all year. But at times, the vow of silence taken by Mansfield is a bit hard to digest. Why would people put up with his silence? How did they simply accept that he had lost his voice? It almost makes the character a bit clownish. Maybe that was the author's intention."], ["This sounds very Michael Vick-ish but, this book seems like a \"how-to\" ghost written by someone I knew.

But while the shop talk about cockfighting is amazingly detailed and impressive, I could give a rat's ass about cockfighting. I never would have read a book with that much shop talk about anything, though admittedly I loved Gun Work by David J. Schow, so I guess I'm a hypocrite. I also find it kind of hard to take the violence involving animals. Last but far from least, this is not a noir or a crime novel; it's a down-and-outer type novel, and a great portrait of a certain culture in the South. But I was kinda looking for a crime novel, and when I got to the end and nobody'd gotten their head blown off, I was a bit disappointed.To be fair, I love Willeford's The Burnt Orange Heresy and that has a murder that seems to be there for no reason other than to make it a crime novel (presumably so he could sell it) and it feels fairly random, with a disappointing ending. So I'm glad he didn't do that here. On its own terms, Cockfighter is a stronger novel than Heresy. There's just kind of a lot of cockfighting in it."], ["Books like Cockfighter remind me of how I came to love literature in the first place. It offers a wonderful sense of being transported to an entirely different place, seeing the world through the eyes of others and then ensuring that I\u2019m so captivated by a series of events that all I want to do in life at a given moment (well, most given moments) is return to the next page.The quote at the beginning of the book is from Ezra Pound \u2013 \u201cWhat matters is not the idea a man holds, but the depth at which he holds it.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of depth in evidence here as protagonist Frank takes the reader into the life of a serious cockfighter.Frank is such a passionate man that he\u2019s vowed, unbeknownst to anyone else, to remain silent until he gains the coveted mark of respect that is the silver medal that marks someone out as the cock handler of the year (sniggers really don\u2019t fit on this occasion!). He explains himself a little here:\u2018No one, other than myself, knew about my vow, and I could have broken it at any time without losing face. But I would know, and I had to shave every day.\u201dThat last phrase is the kind of poetic turn that give the story an extra edge \u2013 Willeford allows his character to tell his tale without relying on the mundane.When we meet Frank, he\u2019s on the cusp of losing everything \u2013 his money, his last fighting bird, his car and his trailer home \u2013 on one fight with an old adversary. It\u2019s a hugely dramatic opening and, at risk of spoiling that drama (look away now) it ends up with Frank leaving the pit with only $10, a coop, a few clothes and a guitar.Given a lift by an old friend who has been forced to retire, he\u2019s offered the chance to buy the perfect bird, Icarus, for the hugely inflated sum of $500. Frank has a choice \u2013 to promise to buy the bird or to give up the game and return home to marry his patient, conservative fianc\u00e9e. Frank\u2019s passion means there\u2019s only one option and he sets off to find the money he needs.What follows is the engrossing sequence of events that will lead up to Frank having the chance to make his personal dream come true.Cockfighter reads like a novel from the depression era, but is set in the 1960s. In some ways, it points to the hangover of values that are old-fashioned in ways that might be seen as good and bad. Frank has his own mixture of values, and his own liberal(ish) views are often contradicted by his animal self or by society. Race and gender are particular areas of interest here.He holds strong opinions on the nature of work and the illusions created by a capitalist society. When looking for a job, he comments:\u2018The majority of the situations that were open in the agate columns were for salesmen. And a man who can\u2019t talk can\u2019t sell anything.\u2019Or on bigger dreams:\u2018I liked the man for what he was and respected him for what he was trying to be. But unlike me, Doc lived with a dream that was practically unattainable. All I wanted to be was the best cockfighter who had ever lived. Doc, who had already reached his late fifties, wanted to be a big time capitalist and financier.\u2019The series of adventures in the book are brilliantly told. There\u2019s a wonderful use of dramatic tension which left me hungry to find out what would happen next. When the final full stop was reached, my appetite was entirely satisfied. Here\u2019s a book the likes of which I wish I could write myself. Given the talent on show and my own limitations that\u2019s very unlikely, but just like Frank I don\u2019t see the harm in setting such a high goal. Maybe I should take a vow of silence; if nothing else I suspect my wife and colleagues would be happier that way.Tremendous."], ["If I hadn't gleefully abandoned all scholarly pursuits some years ago, I'd be pretty tempted to become the preeminent Willeford scholar. My all time favorite literary pattern is the hero's journey (up top, Joseph C) and Cockfighter is more-or-less Willeford's spin on The Odyssey. And I don't think he was necessarily being shy about it. I mean, come on, there's a chicken named Icarus. (Also, there's a chicken called Little David that I'm preeeeeeeeetty sure was the inspiration for Little Jerry.) (Edited to add: Yes, Chris, I know Icarus is not in the Odyssey but, you know, mythology and stuff.)The plot structure to this book is more traditional than those in his other books that I've read so far. There's a man with a goal who sets out on a quest, and unlike Hoke--who gets sidetracked often--Frank Mansfield sticks with his boon of becoming Cockfighter of the Year. This is what drives him, and he doesn't get distracted; every move he makes is done with the goal of winning that title. Like in every good hero's journey there is plenty along the way meant to mislead and tempt him away from his mission, but he isn't swayed for long. Maybe because I've read some of Willeford's other books where characters are more reactionary and the plot jumps according to their whims, but the ending of this almost caught me off guard because it's sort of exactly what you see coming. But it's still pretty awesome.It took me a little longer to get into this book--I think mostly I had to warm up to Frank (hard to replace Hoke in my heart)--but once I got about 100 pages in, I couldn't put it down."], ["I started reading \"Maldoror,\" originally, by the Comte de Lautreaumont, and threw it aside because fifty pages in, I'm pretty sure it's schlock crap.

But it had a good blurb on the back from some great French writer whose name I don't remember, saying \"this book excites me.\"Well, that book really didn't excite me. But this one sure did. I can't describe this book very well, except to say it had the same effect on me reading \"The Gambler\" by Dostoevsky did - that is to say, up late at night, racing to the end, desperate to see what happens next. Frank Mansfield will not say another word until he is the greatest cockfighter in the South, and is recognized as such, and he will sacrifice everything to make it happen.

First published in 1962 by Charles Willeford, later made into a Roger Corman film.", "author": "Charles Willeford"}, "Henry Miller on Writing": {"average_rating": "4.23", "review": [["Henry Miller is one intrepid soul. For me this reading entailed discerning the echoes of the interior of a soul of a brother, a kindred spirit. He articulates creative impulses forged from the smithy of his own rough experience through years of rejection in America and poverty in Paris. Like so many other genius writers Miller was willing to give up every material comfort and to suffer in dire poverty for the sake of his art. He left America to live and suffer in Paris in search of his own artistic voice. You have to admire an artist who is willing to put everything on the line, including his own survival, in order to give all to his art. Having read most of his long masterpieces, it's clear from this reading that he recognizes only one kind of activity -- creation. \"I had observed that those who were most in life, who were molding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing.\" He is ardently engaged in an existential quest through which his writing is the vehicle of the journey. \"In the mind-world ideas are the indestructible elements which form the jeweled constellations of the interior life.\" Miller is fully prepared to make every sacrifice for his art and finds that the risks and rewards justify it. \"Everyone who lifts himself above the activities of the daily round does so not only in the hope of enlarging his field of experience, or even to enrich it, but of quickening it. Accept this view, and the distinction between failure and success is nil. And this is what every great artist comes to learn en route -- that the process in which he is involved has to do with another dimension of life, that by identifying with this process he augments life... He has to make himself a part of the mystery, live in it as well as with it.\" He says that he had two beginnings in America and Europe. In his first year in Paris \"I literally died, was literally annihilated -- and resurrected as a new man.\" When Miller ultimately struggled at the outset after imitating other writers whom he admired, he comes to find that what he needed most desperately was his own voice to express his grief and abandonment and that is how he came to write. \"Finally I came to a dead end which few men have known... to fail as a writer meant to fail as a man. And I failed... It was at this point in the midst of the dead Sargasso Sea, so to speak, that I really began to write... I began from scratch, throwing everything overboard. Immediately I heard my own voice I was enchanted: the fact that it was a separate distinct, unique voice sustained me... My life itself became a work of art. I had found a voice, I was whole again.\" As a writer he finds that \"I am obliged to adapt myself to a struggle in a realm wherein I see nothing to sustain me but my own powers... Like every man I am my own worst enemy, but unlike most men I know too that I am my own savior.\" Heady stuff. He adds that \"the more I wrote the more I became a human being. Miller seems to see the writer as a Dionysian figure. \"Side by side with the human race there runs another race of beings, the inhuman ones, the race of the artists who, goaded by unknown impulses, take the lifeless mass of humanity and by the fever and ferment with which they imbue it turn this soggy dough into bread and the bread into wine and the wine into song.\" Nietzsche would approve. He views himself as the \"madman who dances with lightning in his hands.\" After writing for seven years in America without once having a manuscript accepted and begging, borrowing and stealing to get by, finally he left the country. I have written this before and shall repeat it here: America treats her hacks like literary lions and her literary lions worse than dogs. Eventually Miller's devotion to his art pays off handsomely and his art becomes victor not only over his abject poverty but also even over death. \"You have the dream for night time and the horse laugh for day time.\" Once he finds his own voice in his journey to find the meaning of his own existence, the writing becomes automatic. \"I take down the dictation, as it were. If there are flaws and contradictions, they iron themselves out eventually. If I am wrong today, I am right tomorrow. Writing is not a game played according to the rules. Writing is a compulsive and delectable thing. Writing is its own reward.\" He sees his own writing as constituting a man telling the inexhaustible story of his own life. \"With the endless burrowing a certitude develops which is greater than faith or belief. I become more and more indifferent to my fate as writer, and more and more certain of my destiny as man.\" Of course, he was persecuted and prosecuted for obscenity like James Joyce. On this subject Miller writes: \"This is a mad world; man is most of the time mad; and I believe that in a way what we call morality is merely a form of madness, which happens to be a working adaptation to existing circumstances.\" And then he hits squarely upon his position as an artist working within the body of a human being: \"That sex is a vital part of life goes without question... The gamut of human passion is almost without limits, reaching heights and depths unthinkable. Precisely because it embraces such extremes, passion is the very touchstone of our humanity, and perhaps our divinity also.\" If you desire a brief but deep dive into the life of one of America's real genius novelists, then I can't recommend this book more highly. If you write, then this book is must reading as it will take you years to discover first-hand by your art what Miller shares of his own lifetime of experience and his career as a novelist."], ["This is a book to read, to re-read, to re-read again, if you are interested in writing.

He is like a bloodhound once he catches the scent of a female that he has not had carnal knowledge with. It wasn't that Henry made the best of first impressions, but give him time, give him an evening with a nun, and she'll be at the altar the next morning, still trembling from a night of degradation, renouncing or reaffirming her vows. Henry fought with his wife, the first wife, the one with the shovel face, like two piranhas caught in a barrel. If you have read any of Henry's books you know that he shares his life, everything, even the stuff that makes him look like a lout.\"When I got home my wife was awake and sore as hell because I had stayed out so long. We had a hot discussion and finally I lost my temper and I clouted her and she fell on the floor and began to weep and sob. The girl upstairs came running down to see what was the matter. She was in her kimono and her hair was hanging down her back. In the excitement she got close to me and things happened without either of us intending anything to happen. (I didn't believe that part for a second.) We put the wife to bed with a wet towel around her forehead and the while the girl upstairs was bending over her I stood behind her and lifting her kimono. I got it into her and she stood there a long time talking a lot of foolish soothing nonsense. Finally I climbed into bed with the wife and to my utter amazement she began to cuddle up to me and without saying a word we locked horns and we stayed that way until dawn. I should have been worn out but instead I was wide awake, and I lay there beside her planning to take the day off and look up the whore with the beautiful fur whom I was talking to earlier in the day. After that I began to think about another woman, the wife of one of my friends. Henry is a man that is never satiated. One conquest launches him on a quest for the next one. With a clap on my shoulder and a squeeze Henry always has a new story that has me shaking my head. By comparison, I feel like my life is as boring as a Methodist sermon. Henry is living for all of us. Like every other fool I know...I've lent Henry money. Lent, that is rich, I'm still deluding myself. He doesn't repay a loan. He makes you forget you lent it to him in the first place. I remember one night when a mutual friend of ours explained the circumstances with Henry. \"If you need a little money I'll raise it for you. It's like throwing it down a sewer, I know, but I'll do it for you just the same. The truth is, Henry, I like you a hell of a lot. I've taken more from you than I would from anybody in the world.\" Henry just grinned as our friend's hat passed around, and even people that had known him less than an hour tossed in a bit of green. It wasn't until we were leaving, weaving our own snake trail out the door, that my friend discovered that along with the money, Henry had also absconded with his hat.I was with Henry the night he met the nymphomaniac Paula. \"She has the loose jaunty swing and perch of the doubled-barreled sex, all her movements radiating from the groin, always in equilibrium, always ready to flow, to wind and twist, and clutch, the eyes going tic-toc, the toes twitching and twinkling, the flesh rippling like a lake furrowed by a breeze. This is the incarnation of the hallucination of sex, the sea nymph squirming in the maniac's arms.\", Needless to say I left by myself, but not before Henry touched me for a Jackson. I have never figured out if Henry is a coward or the bravest of the brave. He rejects the life that I spend so much of each day trying to build for myself. He didn't tell me this, but I found it in one of his books. \"I realize quietly what a terribly civilized person I am-the need I have for people, conversation, books, theatre, music, cafes, drinks, and so forth. It's terrible to be civilized, because when you come to the end of the world you have nothing to support the terror of loneliness. To be civilized is to have complicated needs, And a man, when he is full blown, shouldn't need a thing.\" The thing of it is Henry couldn't be Henry except for the existence of people like myself who are always willing to buy him a drink and marvel at his stories. He is living off the efforts of \"civilized\" men and women. He doesn't have to own anything, because someone will always give him what he needs. \"He had neither pride, nor vanity, nor envy. About the big issues he was clear, but confronted by the petty details of life he was bewildered.\"\nThe Nasty GeniusThe thing of it is, despite his best efforts, Henry Miller became a useful member of society. He published books describing a life so unencumbered that even those of us perfectly satisfied with our soft lives, eking out a possession laden life of soulless corporate kowtowing, have doubts that we have chosen our lives wisely. Henry met this woman named June who hauled him off to Paris. \nJuneI don't get to hear his stories first hand anymore. I have to buy his books to find out what he has been up to. I miss Henry. He had me gaze upon the greener pastures on the other side of the fence, but he couldn't convince me to jump over and stay over. Every so often, despite his better financial circumstances, I still get a note from him with a plea for a few dollars for old time's sake. I, the dutiful enabling friend, always send him what I can spare.

The first one was published in 1934, and the second in 1938. Four years made this huge progression \u2013 Miller really evolved as a writer, he became more concentrated and maybe a bit humbler. He is still unconventional, but although he's a mad man (I even felt sorry for him, which I think he would hate the most), I've found so much mellowness, wisdom and truth in his words that I found myself having goose skin. He still has neurotic shifts and he writes about so many people, but in the beginning he described as a hypothesis, what would happen if he wrote thousands of stories.

Yes, sometimes too much gibberish psycho-philosophical rambling, but at least he was honest. And inspiring in this inner struggles and rawness. I mean, he\u2019s trying to be this ultimate brute, and he is, oh definitely don\u2019t underestimate him, but when he shows his soft spots, empathy and sensibility, man, then you\u2019re in trouble, because then he really shines out.

They are having sexual intercourse, God bless them, and I am alone in the Land of Fuck.\nCall this brusque erotica with a literary bent, a pre-Crash lascivious bash, merit-worthy filth for those of that ilk, or prickly porn for cunning linguists. Your choice.  I could take it or leave it. For one thing, it's too damned wordy. Another, I hate the \"c\" word for female genitalia and Miller peppers this book with it.Horizon expanded by maybe half a foot.Do NOT read the below hidden quote if you are sensitive to vulgar language.(view spoiler)[\"This is all a figurative way of speaking about what is unmentionable.

But fuck, the real thing, cunt, the real thing, seems to contain some unidentified element which is far more dangerous than nitroglycerine.\u201d \n(hide spoiler)]"], ["...and Cancer is separated from Capricorn only by an imaginary line.Henry Miller\u2019s second book is a strange and sometimes bewildering but often exhilarating exploration of his early years, before heading to Paris. He pays homage to Dadaism and Surrealism, but not as influences so much as discoveries after-the-fact; discoveries of like-minds who he never knew existed until he was already like-minded.The narrative is dense, compacted, sometimes a single paragraph will extend over several pages, and stylistically shifts gear, sometimes mid-sentence, between a kind of almost traditional yarn-spinning story-telling mode and rambling inner monologues on the idea of the self and society and almost anything, where metaphors and similes crash one upon the other in waves and spurts ... ejaculation after ejaculation; and there is an orgasmic variety of exultation to these moments which does become overwhelming. I mean, an orgasm that goes on too long can become painful... I admit to preferring the periods of this book that were in the more traditional mode, and sometimes had to will myself to stop beginning to scan through the more heavily internalised moments, but there\u2019s also a sense that these moments are meant to wash over you, that the thrusts of Miller\u2019s narrative hips can also rock you to sleep as much as fuck you.Nobody understood what I was writing about or why I wrote that way. I was so lucid that they said I was daffy.The \u2018Miller\u2019 of the \u2018I\u2019 of this story is facing a kind of existential dilemma, a process of self-discovering, but not in a very typical manner. Late in the novel, Miller uses a metaphor to describe his process as going from skating to swimming to being a stone. The \u2018self\u2019, as learned by-product of \u2018otherness\u2019\u2014something we are taught to be\u2014is regarded with great suspicion and like of living, or vitality. This is the skating along the surface, something he used to do as a child to get by. Coming to some sort of realization of this allows one to swim, to be in it and of it. But, finally, in a Zen-like nirvanic construction, the self becomes free from its exteriors and knowledge of itself. The stone, a motif Camus\u2019 early work also plays with. ...He (Roy Hamilton/Macgregor) was appealing ... to the germ of the self, to the being that would eventually outgrow the naked personality, the synthetic individuality, and leave me truly alone and solitary.Some interesting and heavily counter-intuitive (and Dadaist) developments occur through this. To be selfish in the ordinary sense is to be overly concerned with others, since it is to others that you bring yourself to be selfed, for example. An ethics begin to form around the individual as singular biological event that is in itself an ethic, at least, that\u2019s what it demands by not demanding anything. To be \u2018...fixed in a reality which permits the thought that nothing is fixed...\u2019Living is more important than life.It\u2019s a challenging proclamation in our times maybe even more so than his own. This kind of dehumanising/humanising project that Miller proclaims is more important than saving lives or eating. It is the opposite of Polonius in \u2018Hamlet\u2019, which is the kind of standard product we are brought up with, where we are given an exhaustive list of dos and don\u2019ts that change with the tides of the Twittersphere, and end it all with a rounding \u2018to thine own self be true\u2019. This is the spell that is put upon you, that must be broken. It\u2019s all these details that bewilder this Miller, and all the rest of us in our more lucid moments, I suppose, and part of the expression of this bewilderment is in the substance, and part in the style. Far from being nihilistic, and at least influenced to some degree by Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, there is a great celebration of what it is to be completely real and in the moment of human life. To say Yes. To not desire other than through your immediate need and craving. Miller makes it clear in his denouement that his essential concern is not to do with eternity or God or justice, but that it\u2019s human vitality, and the capacity of man to express that vitality....what a man does is of no great importance, it\u2019s what he is that counts.There is only an imaginary line between the Tropics, that is, how we name them, how we make them be. It is tempting to think otherwise, because we can imagine how the world would still circle the sun in the same way if we ceased to be here drawing our lines all over the place to track such things, but the tracks are our tracks. And Miller is not reductive of this, in the end. When he is despairing of his urban landscape at one point, he suddenly realises that the landscape is just as human as he is. The lamp post he was staring dismally at is......not a thing of iron\u2014it is a creation of the human mind... It is a human lamp post.Optimism and delight in the most ordinary aspects of man stripped down to his core is the end point, and a kind of acceptance of the idea of humanity in all its frailties. You can even says Yes and No at the same time ... just do \u2018more than is expected of you.\u2019"], ["Although this novel less famous than tropic of Cancer - for example 8,174 ratings, 309 reviews against 26,082 ratings, 1,465 reviews in goodreads - But it's the better one.When i read Tropic of Cancer i were prepared to all the beauty in it, I read it many years ago translated into Arabic, read many articles about it, But with Tropic of Capricorn - as i thought that Miller is a one work artist - it was like an aesthetic shock.

A Japanese architect and a French actress form the basis of this celebrated short novel, set in Hiroshima, which, essentially is a metaphor for one's inability to forget the wounds of history, during the aftermath of the Second world war. The single couple make up the story where lovers turned friends spend considerable time pondering on previous romances and life experiences. They intertwine their memories on the past, whilst trying to come to terms with the devastation caused by the atomic bomb, and what lies ahead. Sombre in tone and minimal in it's approach, the delicate, sparse narrative is a classic example of how to write about love, striping away all the melodramatic nonsense that clogs up so many other love stories, laying itself down bare, with sorrow and tenderness.Less of a novel, more a work of art. 5/5"], ["\"Delivering body and soul, that's it.

The rhythm of the language is so startling, the rhythm of the repetitions in the conversations, the give and take, the way \"elle\" and \"lui\" echo and augment one another throughout.

Doing so only increased my admiration for Duras's work here, while at the same time helping me realize how much the visual and audio elements of the film augment and alter the words spoken. Having read with interest Amateur Reader's recent post on watching and reading plays, it was an intriguing exercise to go back and read a screenplay of a film I've already watched and savored.In particular, Elle's hypnotic near-monologue from the opening of the film makes a different impression when stripped of the haunting score by Georges Delerue and Giovanni Fusco, and of the shocking and heartbreaking newsreel footage of war devastation (and its counterpoint, near-abstract images of lovers' bodies). Emmanuelle Riva's cadenced delivery of these lines emphasizes the way in which Duras's prose veers, under pressure, into poetic verse and back out again. The score, in turn, underlines that growing pressure underlying Elle's narration, as she tries to convince her Japanese lover that she has seen Hiroshima, that she has witnessed and at some level understands the devastation of the war. Take the following passage, from close to the beginning of the film (all marks and emphasis mine):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quatre fois au mus\u00e9e \u00e0 Hiroshima.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J'ai regard\u00e9 les gens. J'ai regard\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame pensivement, le fer. Le fer br\u00fbl\u00e9. Le fer bris\u00e9, le fer devenu vuln\u00e9rable comme la chair. J'ai vu des capsules en bouquet: qui y aurait pens\u00e9? Des peaux humaines flottantes, survivantes, encore dans la fra\u00eecheur de leurs souffrances. Des pierres. Des pierres br\u00fbl\u00e9es. Des pierres \u00e9clat\u00e9es. Des chevelures anonymes que les femmes de Hiroshima retrouvaient tout enti\u00e8res tomb\u00e9es le matin, au r\u00e9veil.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0J'ai eu chaud place de la Paix. Dix mille degr\u00e9s sur la place de la Paix. Je le sais. La temp\u00e9rature du soleil sur la place de la Paix. Comment l'ignorer?The meaning in English is more or less:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I watched the people. I myself watched, pensively, the metal. Metal burnt. Metal broken, metal become vulnerable like flesh. I saw the bouquet of bottle caps: who would have thought? The preserved human skins, floating, surviving, their suffering still fresh. The stones. Burnt stone. Shattered stone. The anonymous hair that the women of Hiroshima found, fallen out, on waking in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was hot in Peace Square. Ten thousand degrees in Peace Square. I know it. The temperature of the sun in Peace Square - how could you not know it?\nHowever, many of the rhymes and echoes (in particular the \"e\u026a\" sound common among the bolded syllables above) don't translate into English. Try to read it in French even if you don't understand the words, and notice how the rhyming or echoing words are grouped together, often in the shorter sentences. The rhyming/echoing \"e\u026a\" sounds are generally on the accented syllable, and often directly precede a comma or period, which strengthens the stress on those beats. They are repetitive yet syncopated, building on each other to create a rhythmic tension which is alleviated by the counterpoint of the longer sentences, which descend back into a more prose-like rhythm (although the underlined syllables create another, minor rhythmic line). The overall effect is insistent, incantatory. Elle is building a story, a representation that is meant to convince her lover of what she \"knows,\" what we all \"know\": the devastation and cruelty of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. But representations of something felt in the body tend to be problematic in Duras. The insistent yet fragile structure created by Elle's voice is cut short by Lui's stark refusal: \"Tu n'as rien vu \u00e0 Hiroshima, rien.\" (You saw nothing at Hiroshima, nothing.\") Although Duras communicates much of this rhythmic play via punctuation, the text alone simply does not have the power of the full filmic package.\n  1 The score underlines everything I've been talking about with regard to the building rhythmic anxiety: frenetic piano, flute, and string parts underline brilliantly the tension during her speeches about the museum, while his refusals are marked by silence, or the single, elegant line of (I'm guessing?) a clarinet. Just to illustrate the exact points Duras is making, my analysis comes nowhere close to the experience of actually watching all elements come together, which you can do here. The cuts back from the bomb footage to the lovers' bodies provide another method of contrasting the physical immediacy of Elle's current situation with the theoretical nature of her \"knowledge\" about the bomb. And the questions of reality versus representation are brought to yet another level by the fact that this is itself a piece of art, being viewed by an audience, yet it incorporates the same real newsreel footage that Elle keeps referencing. As the viewer, I feel I am coming face to face with the \"reality\" of the war, just as Elle feels she was brought face to face with it by going four times to the museum. My reaction was the same as hers: I wept. The impact of these images does not feel negligible, does not feel like something that can be so cleanly dismissed. And yet of course, my feeling is just as illusory as Elle's: our weeping does not indicate any privileged knowledge of Hiroshima under attack. That kind of knowledge is kept locked in the bodies of those who were there, and any attempt to communicate it in language (as Elle does with her own trauma later on) will lead only to forgetfulness, not to shared understanding.Notes on DisgustI've decided to jot down a few notes for each of my posts about how the book in question might make use of disgust, even if said book is not directly related to my Disgust Project. This is primarily so I can get a better idea what the most common uses of disgust might be.Hiroshima mon amour is remarkable for how little disgust it elicits, considering its subject matter. The opening 15-minute montage, in particular, shows very graphic images of disfigurement following the atomic blast, yet (at least personally) I wouldn't say disgust is my primary emotion on viewing these images. I think this is because the disgust impulse has either been superseded by grief and pity, or has reached a tipping point of extremity into horror. (Since I'm American, there may also be a certain amount of cultural guilt around the knowledge that \"we\" were the ones responsible for the atrocities pictured. Despite the fact that the bomb project was not exactly a democratic decision and happened in any case long before I was born, and despite my strong dislike of nationalism, witnessing photographic evidence of the devastation wrought by one's own country is for some reason more upsetting than witnessing similar devastation wrought by others. As such, most of the disgust I feel when viewing these images is directed inward, if not toward \"me\" at least toward \"us,\" rather than outward toward \"them.\")Speaking from the small amount of reading I've done thus far, and from my common sense, disgust is a largely dehumanizing emotion, used to police boundaries between the \"safe\" and the \"contaminating\" (us and them, clean and dirty, etc.). The degree to which Hiroshima mon amour succeeds in breaking down those us vs. them boundaries can be measured by its communication of horror and grief (however limited or suspect they may be) rather than disgust, to the viewer, despite the inclusion of images which could easily disgust. Bottom line: Transformation of disgust into grief via sympathy.*******\n  1Which is not to say that I disagree with Amateur Reader's overall point: I enjoy reading plays and agree that we can stage them effectively in our imaginations.

Every woman in these two stories exist entirely as sex objects for Joey and Carl, and almost all of them are ready and willing to spread their legs, for money or lust, and occasionally with utter indifference.Normally, this would lead me to rip the story to shreds for its sexism, but I was completely swayed by Miller\u2019s brilliant writing. There isn\u2019t much of a plot here and there are no admirable (or perhaps even likeable) characters, but I devoured every word. It makes me feel like the parents of Colette, the 15-year old runaway waif who gets taken in by Carl and Joey and becomes their \u201cCinderella, concubine and cook\u201d. When Colette\u2019s parents eventually find her they naturally want a word with Carl about his illicit relationship with their daughter. But upon finding out that he and Joey are writers who study the likes of Proust and Goethe, they are instantly placated and decide not to press any charges. As Carl interprets it, \u201cThe French have a great respect for writers, you know that. A writer is never an ordinary criminal\u201d.In the same way, the artistry of Miller\u2019s writing makes me forgive, and in fact, thoroughly enjoy the depravity of his content. Should I feel a bit guilty, or perhaps deceived about this?

Henry Miller is my 'one author who affected me the most' (and I am not using the word influenced on purpose). I've read and reread his novels countless times, always finding new meanings, hidden messages, obscure sentences that burst forth with life. Miller has the power to pick me up when I'm down, the power to make me laugh when I'm sad, the power to see beauty in our messed-up world. Why? Because his works are full of life; life unrestricted, untamed, like pure blood just drawn and spilled all over the pages while still warm. That's Miller for me. Quiet Days in Clichy chronicles a period of about one year. As usual, Miller is broke, sharing an apartment with his friend, who in this book goes by the name of Carl (Alfred Perles, an excellent author himself). In Miller's own words: \"When I think of this period, when we lived together in Clichy, it seems like a stretch in Paradise. There was only one real problem, and that was food. All other ills were imaginary. I used to tell him so now and then, when he complained about being a slave. He used to say that I was an incurable optimist, but it wasn't optimism, it was the deep realization that, even though the world was busy digging its grave, there was still time to enjoy life, to be merry, carefree, to work or not to work.\" This statement, is straightforward Miller if you never read him. Miller, throughout his books and most of his actual life, has had problems with money, or rather the lack of money. As for being an incurable optimist? - no, Miller was not an optimist, he was a man who has lived life to the fullest, tasting all and baring nothing. If you are familiar with his books, you know it wasn't always easy. \"It was a period when cunt was in the air.\" Did I forget to mention that Miller was awfully honest when it came to matters of sex? Most of his works have an underlying sexual motif, a presence of sorts. Some more than others, and Quiet Days in Clichy is of the former category. While many call Miller obscene and even go as far as calling his books pornographic, I've never felt this way. Miller's sex scenes and encounters are spread throughout his work in a matter-of-fact way. He assigns them no importance beyond their occurrences and their consequences. His sexual encounters (while prolific) just happen, so to speak. Here now, tomorrow... It would be foolish to deny that sex played an important role in Miller's life and in his writing, but his writing of sex is not meant to arouse or to provoke, it just is. Sort of like Bukowski's drinking - it just is. This short novella has a surprising amount of crazy encounters in it. Knowing that during this period Miller was writing my favorite book of all time, Black Spring, helps put things into perspective. There is sex peppered throughout the pages, but the sex itself is of no importance. The encounters, however, are. The people Henry and Carl encounter are all rather interesting, their interactions almost psychotic. Especially the episode which results in their departure to Luxembourg. Here, we are offered a different side of Miller. Instead of the carefree, jovial Miller tasting all life has to offer, here, he sounds more like Miller in New York. He's discontent, \"...observing the quiet, dull life of a people which has no reason to exist, and which in fact does not exist, except as cows or sheep exist.\" and \"All they were concerned about was to know on which side their bread was buttered. They couldn't make bread, but they could butter it.\" And despite finding beauty in the Pfaffenthal, \"A thousand years' peace seemed to reign over this somnolent vale. It was like a corridor which God had traced with his little finger, a reminder to men that when their insatiable thirst for blood had been appeased, when they had become weary of strife, here they would find peace and rest.\"He compares Luxembourg to the gray city he dislikes so very much, \"Luxembourg is like Brooklyn, only more charming and more poisonous.\" \"Better to die like a louse in Paris than live here on the fat of the land...\"Upon arrival back in Paris, Miller states: \"Better a good venereal disease than a moribund peace and quiet. Now I know what makes the world civilised: it's vice, disease, thievery, mendacity, lechery. Shit, the French are a great people, even if they are syphilitic. Don't ever ask me to go to a neutral country again. Don't let me look at any more cows, human or otherwise. I was that peppery I could have raped a nun.\"What comes next is an insanely exaggerated scene where sex takes over and all boundaries cease to exist. Cheating a whore by giving her an uncovered check is not anything to be proud off, but Henry and Carl put on quite a show to disguise the fact that the check is bad. This episode, while seemingly unimportant brings to what I consider the best in Miller's writing - the words that resurface in Black Spring. \"Head rolls off table-head rolls off...little man on wheels...wheels...legs...millions of legs...\"The surreal, creative Miller takes over here. This is the Miller I love. The sex scenes end, and he retires with this: \" I got off my ass, yawned, stretched, staggered to the bed.Off like a streak. Down, down, to the cosmocentric cesspool. Leviathans swimming around in strangely sunlit depths. Life going on as usual everywhere. Breakfast at ten sharp. An armless, legless man bending bar with his teeth. Dynamic falling through the stratosphere. Garters descending in long graceful spirals. A woman with a gashed torso struggling desperately to screw her severed head on. Wants money for it. For what? She doesn't know for what. Just money. Atop umbrella fern lies a fresh corpse full of bullet holes. An iron cross is suspended from its neck. Somebody is asking for a sandwich. The water is too agitated for sandwiches. Look under S in the dictionary!\"This reminds me I'll have to revisit Black Spring soon. Overall, Miller's narrative in this novella is what one would expect from Miller. Being an early book, it appears as if he is holding back a bit, but not enough to be politically correct."], ["\u0395\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c5\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03ad\u03bd\u03c1\u03b9 \u039c\u03af\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1 \u03bc' \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 '30 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c4\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 '50 (1956).\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf \u03bc\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03af\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1-\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc. \u0391\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \"\u0397\u03c3\u03c5\u03c7\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u039a\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\" \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af (15-20), \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03af\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b5\u03be, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c7\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae \u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03b9\u03ac \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9."], ["Henry Miller her g\u00fcn kar\u015f\u0131m\u0131za \u00e7\u0131kan yazarlardan de\u011fil.

Or a more prototypical crustpunk/freegan patronizing pretentious self-absorbed dippy douchebag? Or a better example of an annoying shit who thinks just because he's in another country he's interesting?The difference between Miller and generic porn is the fact that Miller isn't profoundly stupid. He's smart enough to know that just having sex and self-consciousness in a novel makes it interesting and literary to New Yorker subscribers, just as he's not smart enough to know just because he's \"honest\" and writes \"honestly\" about sex doesn't mean he's a genius. A satire about pretentious assholes done by pretentious assholes is still pretentious and full of assholes.When he's not annoying me for being a smug snot-nosed shit, though, Miller is fun to read, and he does have some oh-so-French lines. He's essentially a writer of romance novels (fantasies) for writers, virginal librarians and others who yearn for the Good Old Days of Debauchery. But nothing takes me out of a sex scene more than the word \"boobies.\"A lot of people seem to be under the impression that this and other Miller is written by an old man reminiscing about his young and carefree days. But by my estimation, if Miller was born in 1891, and these stories take place in the early 30's, he'd be a 40-year old banging 14-year old chicks, among other casually creepy and misogynistic things. So take it or leave it if that floats your boat, but stop picturing him in your head as a harmless naif or innocent freshman."]], "review_count": "129", "description": "This tender and nostalgic work dates from the same period as Tropic of Cancer (1934). It is a celebration of love, art, and the Bohemian life at a time when the world was simpler and slower, and Miller an obscure, penniless young writer in Paris.

As the book opens, Hoke, although still only in his forties, wakes up to a full-blown mid-life crisis. He's completely unable to function irrespective of his responsibilities to his two teenage daughters who live with him, to his department, and to his partner, Ellita Sanchez, who is eight months pregnant (not by Hoke) and who also lives in Hoke's home.Unable to cope, Hoke takes a leave of absence from his job and retreats to Singer Island, where his wealthy father lives. He takes a job running a small apartment building for his father and swears that he will never leave the island again.In the meantime, Stanley Sinkiewicz, an elderly retiree who has moved to Florida from Detroit has a brush with the law and, although he is completely innocent, he is briefly forced to share a jail cell with a man claiming to be Robert Smith. \"Smith\" is really a psychopathic career criminal named Troy Louden. He has a gift for reading people and immediately pegs Stanley for the sad, lonely man he is at heart. Louden befriends Stanley, schooling him in the way to best deal with the authorities, and before long, Stanley is convinced that Troy is his new best friend. Louden is desperately hoping to have the charges against him dropped before a fingerprint check is returned and the police discover his real identity. To this end, he asks Stanley to do him a \"small favor\" once he is released, and, totally won over by his new buddy, the old man agrees. The ploy works and Louden, now free, enlists Stanley to help him pull off a big job he is planning.Meanwhile, Hoke Mosley is discovering that it's a lot harder to simplify his life than he had hoped. His father is determined to help him get a new job with the local police force, although Hoke has absolutely no interest in the job. His younger daughter joins him on the island further complicating matters, and the tenants in the apartment house generally prove to be a major pain in the butt.The Mosley story and the Stanley/Louden story proceed along parallel tracks and for a while the reader is left to wonder how Willeford is ever going to link them up. But it really doesn't matter because both stories are very entertaining.Willeford has populated this book with a number of unique and very interesting characters and between the lines, he has a great deal to say about the nature of family and about the workings of the capitalist system in the United States. All in all, it's a very entertaining book that should appeal to large numbers of readers."], ["Hoke Moseley truly is a one of a kind protagonist and Sideswipe is his most uniquely Willefordian case yet. A detective novel where the crime occurs in the last chapter, that alternates between the plotting of a heist and the workings of a policeman are not exactly rare you might say but in the hands of Charles Willeford this generic plot takes on a whole new life.Instead of intricate details of who goes where and when, a recce of the bank in question and potential getaway routes led by a criminal mastermind we are treated to the chess like machinations of a criminal psychopath as seen through the eyes of a clueless Florida retiree.And anybody who's picked up a Hoke Moseley novel will happily tell you that Hoke is no hero cop, no genius detective, no gumshoe with keen insight in to the criminal mind, Hoke is a middle aged man without any teeth currently going through a midlife crisis as he faces up to living with his two teenaged daughters and his former detective partner currently eight months pregnant, all the while being inundated with mind numbing desk work.The majority of the novel then is NOT your typical pulp crime shenanigans; it is a treatise on how two men are lost in an America changing beyond their recognition or their abilities to cope, there's an affecting look at how family can mean many different things to different people and can be made up of many different people not just those you are born to, and yet Hoke is still a decent cop who does some solid work when not wearing yellow jumpsuits and moonlighting as an apartment manager to avoid responsibilities.The invention of Stanley the retired automotive worker is a particular high point for me, the poor clueless guy who just wants to find a place for himself in society with what's left of his life has a true innocence to the way he sees the world and the way he is introduced to the reader is the work of a genius. Willeford twists and turns the reader around in that opening chapter until it ends with a full on \"holy fuck, did that really just happen?!\" moment. Willeford was a prolific and much respected author but this has to be right up there with his finest moments, and probably the finest moments ever captured in crime fiction."], ["The Hoke Moseley novels are about a detective, but they are not novels in the detective genre. Charles Willeford never dangles any clues or misdirection in front of the readers, and the actual crime that needs to be solved doesn't happen until the tail end of the book. Instead, he holds the readers interest with remarkably vivid portraits of his characters, various locales in Miami area and of course the themes he brings up (How easily decent (but gullable) people can sometimes be turned to crime, the american dream, sub-urban life, modern art, mid-life crisis, public education, etc.). Charles keeps a swift pace and never lingers on any one particular issue, always rewarding the readers with more interesting tid-bits to chew on, but admittedly, readers accustomed to more formulaic crime novels will be left in the cold (not only does the crime only happen at the end of the book, but for the majority of the novel Hoke is on leave from the force and very intent on never coming back). This novel challenges the conventions of the set formulas and challenges the reader (if only so slightly), but hey, I would expect nothing less from a literary-genre novel."], ["The description on the back of the jacket begins with the line, \u201cThere comes a time in every detective's life when he's had enough.\u201d After reading that, and not knowing anything about the character, Hoke Mosely, you might assume this story was about a law and order man pushed to the edge of sanity by the degenerate dredges of society, akin to a right-wing revenge fantasy like Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry or Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey in Death Wish. You\u2019d be wrong, kind of, but you\u2019d also be pleasantly surprised.What pushes Hoke Mosley to the edge isn\u2019t so much the scum of the earth committing senseless acts of depravity\u2014although there\u2019s plenty of this; Willeford is delightfully unafraid of being politically incorrect in his depictions of police life\u2014but more mundane, everyday problems: a teenage daughter who wants to drop out of high school, another daughter who develops an eating disorder, busywork at the office, financial strife, and a pregnant roommate/coworker who eats her eggs in the most excruciating way possible. All this leads Hoke to a nervous breakdown that takes him out of Miami and back to the sleepy rural Florida vacation community he grew up in, charged with only the mundane tasks of maintaining his father\u2019s hotel in an effort to \u201csimplify his life.\u201dMeanwhile, adopting the same parallel narrative structure from Miami Blues, Willeford introduces us to Stanley, a retired auto-worker who disowns his family after they fail to rush to his aid when he\u2019s falsely accused of molesting a child, and Troy, a self-described psychopath who enlists Stanley\u2019s aid to get out of prison and later recruits Stanley for his gang/family (Troy also admits to being an admirer of Charles Manson), along with a struggling Barbadian painter, and an emotionally damaged and physically deformed stripper.The middle of the story dragged a little, and at first the premise of Hoke having a nervous breakdown seemed a little forced, but by the time you reach the climax, almost everything seems to come together brilliantly. Willeford has a gift for using minute but bizarre details to either set up jaw-dropping plot twists or hilarious diatribes that seem to stem from his own cynical grievances. Without giving too much away, the robbery gone awry\u2014again an element repeated from Miami Blues\u2014is one of the best, and most brutal chapters of crime fiction I\u2019ve ever read. It might be his personal history as a decorated combat veteran, but the man knows how to write a gruesome gunshot wound.What I didn\u2019t like: If there\u2019s one criticism I have, it\u2019s that he writes pretty weak female and minority characters. A reoccurring theme between this book and Miami Blues is whores who are good at housework, weak-willed and irrational, they sit around being told what to do by a man who abuses and exploits them, although this could be Willeford commenting on the degrading effects on the psyche of life in the sex industry. Or he could just be a misogynist.What I did like: The parallels. He jokes about this with a throwaway line in the last chapter, but I really enjoyed the way Willeford juxtaposes events in Stanley\u2019s/Troy\u2019s timeline with events in Hoke\u2019s. He emulates but differentiates the climax and the ending of this book from the ending and climax of Miami Blues. Ellita, Hoke\u2019s partner, attempts to apprehend Troy by the book, firing a warning shot when she attempts to apprehend him, and she\u2019s punished for this, but when Hoke encounters Junior at the end of Miami Blues, he takes the law into his own hands, executing him coldly and deliberately. At the beginning of the book as Hoke\u2019s family falls apart, Troy\u2019s family assembles, and at the end of the book as Hoke\u2019s family rejoins in resolution, Troy\u2019s family disperses in bloody carnage. We\u2019re left not entirely sure if Troy really wanted to live happily ever after at The Hotel Oluffsson (I\u2019ve been there!) with his family/gang, or if he merely snapped when a seemingly routine robbery went haywire due to mundane details overlooked, thus serving as a callback to the inciting incident of Hoke\u2019s nervous breakdown."], ["Such sadness. I have only one more Hoke Moseley book to go. The late and great Charles Willeford passed away after 4 of this series, leaving behind a magnificent legacy. His genius lies in the minutiae of his character's development. In the Hoke Moseley series, he employs the brilliant technique of alternating each chapter between the daily lives of Hoke and his immediate family and colleagues and the villains as they plan their crime. As such, the crimes don't actually occur until late in each novel finishing with explosive endings.So far, this is the best of the series, even better than the first, Miami Blues. It is so great to read of Miami in the 1980s without the pastel-cladded shallowness depicted in Miami Vice :)His characters are the down outs, the losers, the never weres and are written is such a beautiful matter of fact way, I can see why guys like Elmore Leonard and James Lee Burke cited him as such a major influence. His work spanned 40+ plus years and, for mine, his novel Pick-Up is the ultimate masterpiece of \"nihilist-noir\"."], ["I almost felt like I was reading a crime fiction novel written by Raymond Carver. Melancholic crime fiction?. I don't know if SIDESWIPE can be classified as a crime fiction novel. After Willeford achieved success with MIAMI BLUES, he really cranked it up a few notches, wrote the novels that he wanted to write. Hoke Moseley is the exact opposite of a tough cop. He seems to be resigned to his fate, stops talking to his police partner and daughter and moves back in with his father who gives him a job managing a vacation resort sort of place. But Moseley springs into action when a suave, smooth talking barbarian carries out violent robberies of department stores. The character of the barbarian is described from the point of view of an aging middle class drone who finances his most ambitious operation (mostly to find some kind of excitement in what has been a dull life). So we are not really sure if his narrative is completely reliable. The best Charles Willeford novel I have read so far."], ["I'm not sure what's going on, but I think I've started to develop a little crush on Hoke Moseley. I know, right? I mean, he pees his pants within the first ten pages of this book. But I feel such a strong affection toward him for some reason.The structure of this book is more similar to Miami Blues in that every other chapter is about Hoke, and the odd ones deal with another storyline about a criminal sociopath (Troy) who isn't Junior, but might as well be. I completely loved the way it all came together at the end. It's shitballs crazy awesome. And I love how even though throughout the plots of these books Hoke's life is fairly shitty, at the end he gets a nice little pick me up and you're ready to move on thinking the old guy is going to be okay.My favorite thing about Willeford is the little details. The fact that Hoke tries to cheat at Monopoly. His recipe for beef stew. I love it all."], ["Ballsy. Possibly one of the stranger detective novels I've read. The detective is essentially on break (midlife crisis) and we spend most of the book waiting for the damn crime to be committed!!! Half of the book follows Moseley trying to simplify his life (with amusing results) and heart-warmingly dealing with his youngest teenaged daughter. The other half follows Stanley, a sad-hack retiree who poisons dogs, and Troy, a criminal psychopath who brings together a \"family\" to pull off a heist. What kept me laughing were the off-beat portraits and deadpan observations/statements - Professor Itai and his lamenting of the lack of intact Ethiopian horsefly specimens, Hoke advising his father that fruit was a better gift than flowers for his bulimic daughter, Stanley Junior having to sit in a cardboard shithouse during staff meetings because he wasn't performing."], ["The character of Stanley Sinciewicz, and what happens to him, is the best part."], ["Imagine this: adding Grape-Nuts to a sieve so you can run hot water to soften them up so you can eat them without putting in your false teeth; then gumming them at the dining room table while reading the sports section. Hoke, a homicide investigator lives with his partner Ellita who has the unbearable habit of letting the egg yolks run through her teeth. Ellita, who is pregnant, helps with the rent and the care of Hoke two teenage daughters.Shades of Ed McBain, the writing, I mean. Hoke gets fed up with trying to solve an interminable number of cold cases that seem to be forever piling up on his desk. He retreats into a catatonic state, finally decides to chuck it all, and leaves for his father's place on Riviera Beach. He has decided he wants the simple life. Right. We all know there is no such thing, and soon his bulimic daughter (recognized as such only by a neighbor) comes to visit (she gets shipped off to his ex,) he's having to deal with the myriad problems as manager of his father's apartment building (he gets free rent in one of the apartments) and Ellita calls for help in dealing with her mother's thoughts on amniocentisis.A side plot (never fear, the two will intersect) involves a retired Ford employee falsely accused of molesting his neighbor's daughter, a problem that's soon rectified but not before Stanley meets Troy in jail who has a scheme to make lots of money, also involving a painter and a former stripper whose face was mutilated by her boss. Enough of the plot. You can find that elsewhere. Hoke soon realizes that the simple life is effervescent. First rate story and writing by a master. Mislabeled as a thriller, though, unless impending disaster provides you with the sense of thrill. An engrossing, very enjoyable story. If you like McBain, Moseley, Leonard, et al, you'll very much like Williford."]], "review_count": "3", "description": "Florida homicide detective Hoke Moseley's life suddenly went to bell one morning.

It\u2019s one I\u2019m a little embarrassed to admit. The problem is not with the writing or the characters that Stevenson has created; it\u2019s not even with the plot. The problem resides with Kermit the Frog. (Stay with me here!) I grew up watching the muppets. I became slightly obsessed with them. I kind of wanted to join them. So, whenever I read about Captain Smollett and Long John Silver all I can see is Kermit fighting Tim Curry! Therefore, I just can\u2019t take this book seriously. Well, at least not completely. The Muppet Treasure Island is such a great film; it\u2019s hilarious. This book was much more serious. The pirates in here aren\u2019t singing toys; they\u2019re hardened criminals that created the pirate stereotype. They\u2019re the sort of men you don\u2019t want on your ship because they\u2019d likely cut your throat in your sleep. They might wake you up first if they\u2019re feeling kind. So, they wouldn\u2019t try and gain your trust by singing you a jolly song about piracy, like Tim and his muppet mates would. But, muppet based comparison aside, this is a good novel. I did quite enjoy it. It all begins when the young Jim Hawkins comes across a map for buried treasure, except he hasn\u2019t got any money to fund the voyage. He  Gonzo and Rizzo goes alone and seeks the help of  Fozzie Bear  Squire Trelawney. As a member of the Victorian gentry, he takes the map for himself with the intention of filling his own coffers with the loot. He\u2019s not a very nice  bear  guy, and he\u2019s not overly intelligent either. In his frugality he accidently hires a group of twisted  muppets  pirates that, unsurprisingly, mutiny against him. This all sounds terrible, I know. But, it\u2019s not all bad because the ship\u2019s captain is none other than  Kermit the Frog  Captain Smollett who is absolutely in love with  Miss Piggy  no one. Indeed, Smollett is in direct contrast to the money driven  Fozzie  Trelawney because he is everything he is not; he is brave and honourable; he is completely true to his word. He is competing, unknowingly, for the attention of Jim. The young boy is looking for a farther figure, and in Silver and Smollett he sees two potential role models, and two potential life choices. It all works out in the end though because this is a  muppet movie adventure book after all. In all seriousness, it is an exciting book. But, for me, that\u2019s all it is. There are no hidden motives or dark secrets. Everything is straight forward, clean cut and simple. It is a nice easy read. Stevenson\u2019s masterpiece is most definitely  The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde. That\u2019s where the real mystery is at. But, it doesn\u2019t have muppets\u2026.."], ["YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!!!This is the iconic novel about pirates that it stands as the best example in this topic and easily one of the most adapted to other media novels in any genre.I can remember having watched several adaptations, live action films, animated movies, even an animated film using animals as the characters, there is the Muppets' one, a Japanese anime TV series, an European mini-series taking the story to outer space starring Anthony Quinn, the animated remake of that version by Disney and the current Starz channel prequel TV series \"Black Sails\". Just to mention the ones that I have watched but there are a lot of more adaptations.While the topic of pirates is a popular one, I think that there aren't much novels about it. At least not examples really worthy of reading them. Obviously there are some here and there, but taking in account how much options one has in other topics in literature, pirates has been a concept seldom touched with success.However, this novel was able to keep on the mind of everybody the storytelling appeal of the topic of pirates inspiring successes on other media such as Japanese anime \"Captain Harlock\" and live actions films of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".For all that and its own merit, Treasure Island keeps retaining the crown as the best novel about pirates. Characters like Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Ben Gunn, Captain Smollett and of course, Long John Silver have become iconic in the universe of literature. Even they have been so admired that other authors couldn't resist to makes homages/mentions of them on their own novels, such examples like on Peter Pan.Its appealing is obvious depending the readers, many young ones can't resist to be amazed by Jim Hawkins who is 14 years old but he is able to keep up in the middle of adult characters and even being a key character in the success of the adventure.To readers and writers of all ages, certainly the character of Long John Silver stands out as one of the best developed characters in the history of literature becoming a model to many following similar ones. He is able to do ruthless things but he has a code, he has limits, and not matter that he is not a nice person, there are things that he never will do and for that, he is a complicated and truly interesting character to read about.Not matter how was on real life, Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, was able to show a romantic picture of pirates' world with now iconic elements like islands with treasures, maps with \"x\"'s, fearful papers with a black spot, peglegs, eye patches, parrots on shoulders, but above all, he had no doubt to show how dangerous and murderous can be real pirates."], ["Three items worthy of note in R. L. Stevenson's classic treasure, \"Treasure Island\":1) There are a ton of tropes! We understand that this is pretty much what Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ripped off, making tons of money off of this adventurous classic, including but not limited to: rampant alcoholism; a code of honor; castaways (at sea or in land); shipwrecks (new and ancient); treason (group & individual) & double crosses; mutiny, hostages, captures and shocking escapes; strangers appearing from the mist & pirate flags; raresome slapstick comedy (\"...[he] fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor.\" [16]) & good comedic timing (the parrot tells everyone The Secret, ruining plans); a compass made up entirely of human bones; & ghosts.2)Jim Hawkins is your typical YA protagonist prototype. He's the go-between of the two fighting groups, the one who bargains with the villain Long John Silver (mmm.... breaded fish and shrimp...) and propels the narrative forward. He's the center; a dreamer; while he loses his humility he attains a coming-of-age wisdom that peaks at the point where he brandishes a pistol for the first time.3)The plot resembles a Hollywood blockbuster. There is very little inaction, but when it occurs (such as the villain's cliched soliloquy or the factions grunting against their enemies) it does decelerate the pace of the story. Here is a very substantial urge to make everything explosive and loud. Thank you, Mr. Stevenson!"], ["Treasure Island is arguably one of the most influential tales in the world of fiction. Every pirate stereotype that we take for granted these days we can see the foundation somewhere in this magic tale. Approaching this story; I am quite lucky that I knew nothing about the plot except that there was a map where X marked the spot showcasing Captain Flint's legendary treasure. I went into the task of reading this like a happy youth, wide-eyed looking forward to experiencing a legendary story for the first time without being hindered with prior knowledge of the narrative, the characters, the pace and the plot twists.So the story goes something like this. An alcoholic ex-pirate Captain spends his days in a local bar drinking himself to death whilst singing jolly pirate songs. \"Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum\" etc... He, unfortunately, passes away and leaves a chest which contains a secret map amongst other treasures. The map is highly sought after by all the wrong people. Our 1st person perspective young superstar Jim Hawkin's finds the map and speaks to his friends Dr. Livesey and a squire, Mr. Trelawney and they decide to venture to this mystical treasure island to hunt for said treasure. Leaving from Bristol, they gather a ships worth of pirates and hands. Experienced in their own ways but none more so than pleasant, pub-owning ship's cook Long John Silver. So off they go on this adventure. They get the treasure and go home and live happily ever after. But, that obviously didn't happen because that would not make a legendary story. The main protagonist, Jim is a great character. This is typically seen as a children's book (although some of the sea and pirate terminology is quite specific and complex) and having the first person perspective shown from the view of a young kid adds to the remarkableness of the story. The fact Jim is a young man who performs extraordinary deeds, often going against the odds on the Hispaniola (the trusty vessel that takes them to treasure island) or the island itself amongst hardened sea-faring men means we really have his back and support his deeds throughout the tale. We feel close to him because of how well Stevenson writes this character. Every time the plot progresses, it is because of an amazing deed that Jim has done, often on his own back without the consultation of the most senior members of the group. We route for him every second of the way because he is us. Things don't work out smoothly when they get to the Island. A divide occurs. Mutiny some might say. A split is presented so Jim, Dr, Squire and a few trusted men are on one side. Old pirates who were part of Captain Flint's crew rally under who we thought was a nice dude. Long John Silver.He is the most complex character in this short book. Peg legged, parrot on his shoulder \"pieces of eight\" are some of his characterisations that you will probably see some 12-year-old child imitating this Halloween. You never quite know where you stand with Silver. He starts off seeming good. Jim overhears his plot of mutiny whilst hiding in a barrel. At that point, he is portrayed as purely evil but towards the end, he seems more human and complex. Sticking up for Jim Hawkins when the rest of his sea mates want to kill the poor lad. Other notable characters are Ben Gunn, the Robinson Crusoe-esque marooned island dweller and Dr. Livesey. It is ingeniously written that in such a short book we can care about so many of the players and their complexity is unrivaled. There are lots of cool scenes. Shootouts on the Island between the two factions. Jim vs. Israel Hands. Meeting Ben Gunn and when Jim goes back to the safe haven of the wooden castle expecting to regroup with his friends but alas... it is not to be. I will end this review with a few pirate clich\u00e9s that frequent Treasure Island. \"Shiver my timbers\" \"Shipshape\" \"Jolly Roger\" & \"Pieces of Eight\" come to mind. I really enjoyed this. So different to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde that I have previously read by Stevenson.

And the first Pirates of the Carribbean movie came out and was surprisingly awesome? And then the second Pirates of the Carribbean movie came out and was decidedly less awesome, but you didn't really realize it until the third one came out and you discovered you couldn't remember and didn't care about number two's cliffhanger ending (it was like The Matrix in that way actually)? And then you finally saw the third one on DVD when you were home from the hospital after almost dying of mono,who knew that could happen, but apparently it really messes with your liver, and the movie was so bad you couldn't even stay awake through the literally 45-minute long action sequence that caps it all off, and besides, it makes no sense at all, with everyone betraying everyone else so many times you need a flow chart to follow the plot?I suppose we have RLS and Treasure Island to blame for all that. Because this is the book that established what we think of when we think of pirates, from skull & crossbones banners to peg legs to squawking shoulder-mounted parrots to maps with big red Xs and yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. It's kind of weird to think about: those concepts are so ingrained in our culture (see: International Talk Like a Pirate Day), and yet they all stem from this rather innocuous adventure story for children.But it is a really great adventure, which is probably why it became so iconic. This book is 130 years old but exhibits none of the mustiness of late Victorian-era fiction (turgid description being the chief offender, which you know if you've tried to slog through Jules Verne, and how in the world do you make submarines and sea monsters boring? Ask Jules). The adventure clips along quite nicely, moving from murder and mayhem on dry land to mutiny and more murder on the sea, and then to a creepy island filled with treasure and other dangers. Long John Silver is a crafty and compelling villain, switching sides more often than Benjamin Linus (hey, speaking of islands). Even though I knew basically where the story was going, it was a fast and engaging read, with a lot of creative sequences of suspense. The only sections that bogged down a bit were the brief but somewhat technical descriptions of the ship, the sails, how the waves turned it this way and that, etc. I don't know starboard from port, and I don't care to, RLS. So get back to the parts with the talking parrot."], ["As Indiana Jones once, rather astutely pointed out, when it comes to treasure \"X never, ever marks the spot\". Well, it does if you're a pirate, which basically means that as a pirate you have a statistically much higher chance of finding treasure than any archaeologist ever would. I find this a bit unfortunate and if someone had presented me with this hard and fast evidence I would have ticked the pirate box and not the archaeologist box on my careers worksheet at school. Instead, I have to make do with reading Treasure Island and fantasising about my ideal bespoke treasure island (emeralds growing on trees- I know this is an arboreal unlikelihood but it's my fantasy so back off; lagoons filled with sapphires, gold dubloons in huge heapy piles at the foot of azure blue waterfalls and knuckle sized diamonds to be chipped off the walls of underground caverns). Stevenson's Treasure Island is much less of a Disney-esque fantasy and Jim Hawkins, narrator and salty sea dog in the making, is forced to pit his wits against the wiliest of all pirates, Long John Silver in a race to retrieve the booty. After finding an oil-skin map in a dead mans chest (nice Robert, very nice) Jim sets off to find some trustworthy (or gullible) adults. Jim must be in possession of some serious powers of persuasion because within minutes the good squire and his associates are rustling up a ship (no mean feat when a schooner could set you back \u00a36000 and your chance of surviving the voyage was slim), tightening their buckanneering belts and getting ready to hit the high seas. It turns out the ships cook is more than he seems though and not to be underestimated (I wonder if JF Lawton, the writer of Under Siege was a Treasure Island fan, after all he served up Casey Rybeck, the most underestimated ships cook of all time).Caribbean capers ensue as Long John Silver serves up a melting pot of mendacity in an attempt to get his hand on Captain Flint's treasure. Jim Hawkins proves he's tougher than a soused herring that's been at the bottom of a barrel for a year and successfully repels the Island siege before hoisting the main sail, jibing -ho and heading for Britain. The other pirates are left marooned as a punishment and their skeletons will be unearthed 250 years from the time of telling during the construction of a Sandals adult holiday resort. Personally I think I'd rather be marooned than go to Sandals."], ["ARRrrr, me reader! Embark now on a voyage of high seas adventure with scurvy pirates, honest jack-tar sailors, marooned souls, and a vast treasure buried on some faraway island. Aye, that's Treasure Island!

I read this book as a young adult when I received it as a Christmas present from an aunt and uncle. At first, although I knew it was a classic, I wasn't too anxious to jump into it. I wasn't a big fan of pirates and boats. I wasn't a normal kid, what can I tell you. But... it was a gift and I thought I should give it a chance. And once I did, I loved it. I had read Peter Pan recently and felt a kismet connection of sorts between them. From the adventures to the bonds, to the test of good versus evil, the book had so many wonderful moments. And since then, I've sampled many different iterations, from movies to other books with pirate stories, all the way to Once Upon a Times interpretation. It's truly a remarkable story that helps young adults figure out how to approach a world full of fears, hopes and questions. And to think it's a pirate and a cook who help you to figure some of it out. But it's more. There's bonding. And team work. And treasure hunting. And challenges. And mystery. All culminating in reaching one's goals in ways you didn't necessarily expect.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "4", "description": "Public Places - Urban Spaces is a holistic guide to the many complex and interacting dimensions of urban design.

It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "2", "description": "For close to 100 years, Seattle'\ufffd's Pike Place Public Market has been a favorite destination for food-loving locals and tourists alike.

I am honestly surprised by how much of a great job this kind of poetry book does while trying to present poetry to children.

However, the most amazing thing about the \"Poetry for Young People\" books is that they also provide short definitions of words that children may not know right on the page where the word is located. I think these books are being made in order to assure children learn about poetry but also grow some interest. Learning about poetry is very important because it is a way of expressing ones feelings. Understanding poetry or figurative language is important in order for children to have a better understanding of what is being said by people in their surroundings. I also liked how on top of each poem their is kind of like an introduction or explanation of the poem that follows, this in a way is to assure students understand what they are reading.

No, Edward Lear didn't ask only one woman his entire life to marry him (and one who was 46 years younger than he and who said no, twice) because he was \"so shy.\" He was, as my mother-in-law says, \"gay as the day is long.\" Telling kids that some people in the world are gay isn't going to warp them, and it's not developmentally inappropriate.

They are weird and filled with fun rhymes and crazy, made-up words (usually my thing), but there is so much that just doesn't make any sense at all. Perhaps it's the language barrier--these do contain a lot of English (as in the UK) words and colloquialisms. The good parts are the short intro/explanation before (most) of the poems. This really helped give me some context and kind of make sense of the proceeding poem. Oddly enough, my children were not keen on these and often cut me off when I read the short paragraph asking me to just read the poem. hmmfThe illustrations are interesting--very colorful, detailed and go well (for the most part) with the poems.I am not sure how I would use this in a classroom. This might not be something I can incorporate into a lesson--there is just so much other great poetry out there!"], ["Edward Lear is a very creative writer in his children's poetry. This book was, full of the craziest made up words that you can think of. It is great for keeping children's attention though because they will be amused by the words they hear and read in this book.

Children would enjoy being able to look at the creative pictures while being read the ridiculous rhymes. The poems in this book are great for introducing children to poetry and can help the younger children learn how to rhyme and shows them which words rhyme with what.

It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me. I'm off to 'A Season in Hell.'"], ["ONE OF THE BOOKS OF MY LIFE .

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "6", "description": "Sian Phillips and Peter O'Toole were one of the theaters most fabulous couples--a marriage perhaps rivaled only by that of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in terms of glamour, power, and public fascination. In her exceptional memoir, Phillips reveals in thoughtful detail their tumultuous life together. She describes the mad and impulsive times with the infamous hellraiser alongside the tempestuous, insecure, and often lonely periods in their marriage. When OToole's career took off with \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" Sian found life increasingly difficult in her parallel roles as wife, mother, and actress, and watched as her own career became progressively sidelined. Against all expectations, though, their union endured for twenty years. When it ended, incredibly, even to herself, Sian plunged straight into another marriage, to a much younger man. Ultimately she emerges alone--triumphant and unrepentant--and the story she recounts here ranks alongside the very best in show business.<br />", "author": "Sian Phillips"}, "The Pobble Who Has No Toes (Edward Lear's Little Books of Nonsense)": {"average_rating": "4.66", "review": [["The Owl and the Pussycat and other nonsense is a book of Edward Lear's eccentric and unique comic verse, published in 2012 to celebrate the bicentenary of the author's birth. It is lavishly illustrated with watercolour paintings by the Australian artist, Robert Ingpen. This is a happy combination, as Ingpen's depictions, based on Australian flora, seem to be a perfect fit for Lear's imagined Bong-tree Land. Edward Lear was one of 20 children. He suffered from epilepsy, and had a very unhappy childhood as an unwanted member of the family. He was largely brought up by an elder sister who encouraged him to develop his artistic talent. Interestingly, Sarah, another sister of his, was also a talented artist and writer, though she is largely forgotten now. This edition of the book is dedicated to her memory. It includes seven of Edward Lear's most popular poems:The Owl and the PussycatThe JumbliesThe Dong with a Luminous NoseThe New VestmentsThe Duck and the KangarooCalico Pie and How Pleasant to Know Mr. LearIt is perfectly possible to read Lear's verse in a standard collection of poetry, as words on the page without the aid of pictures. Perhaps this is how most of us remember reading him in childhood. Or perhaps you may remember them being read aloud, as hearing them aloud benefits the language enormously. I would defy anyone not to \"hear\" them in their head as they read. But there is another consideration with this particular book.For those adults - and some children - who find Lear's eccentric descriptions all but impossible to visualise, these illustrations are not only very attractive but also a great help with interpretation. Lear's sing-song language is easy and repetitive, the sound of his verse and his imagery will delight young children, yet his ideas are sometimes so ludicrous as to be unimaginable. Can you see a \"runcible spoon\" in your mind's eye? Or \"The Dong with a Luminous Nose\"? I couldn't - even though in this case Lear gives a detailed description of him - until I looked at the illustrations.\"Far and few, far and fewAre the lands where the Jumblies live;Their heads are green and their hands are blue,And they went to sea in a Sieve.\"We first hear this refrain in \"The Jumblies\", and it is then echoed in \"The Dong with a Luminous Nose\", a poignant and mournful verse. Sad though it is, it is probably my personal favourite. Perhaps though, it is as well that it is followed by \"The New Vestments\"; such a silly piece of nonsense that it makes the reader laugh out loud. And small children will love the \"rude\" and funny picture in this book. \"How Pleasant to Know Mr. LearWho has written such volumes of stuff!Some think him ill-tempered and queer,But a few think him pleasant enough.\"So where on earth did he get his odd ideas? What made him juxtapose such ridiculous items to make a more-or-less coherent whole? The answer seem to be that, in common with many comedians throughout history, he was trying to escape his own unhappiness. He started out as a draughtsman for the Zoological Society of London, making drawings of rare birds and animals. Some of his beautiful bird paintings from this time are included in the books. He entertained his employer's children with his drawings and invented nonsense rhymes, to which they showed, \"uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.\" Imagine how welcome such approval must have been to a young man who had sadly experienced little of this in his life to date. He went on to travel throughout Europe, writing and illustrating guides to various places, and these came to the attention of Queen Victoria. She was so impressed that she promptly employed Edward Lear as her drawing master. In 1870 he published his most famous poem, The Owl and the Pussycat, with which he found his perfect niche. To the end of his days he commented on the world around him in a nonsensical style, referring most revealingly once to, \"This ludicrously whirlygig life which one suffers from first and laughs at afterwards.\"Even writing what amounts to his own obituary, with a letter sent to a friend shortly before his travels, he ends it, typically,\"Oh bother!\" The text of the letter is included in the book, as is a short biography of the author. Additionally there are contributions by the illustrator, Robert Ingpen. He has written a two-page botanical study entitled \"Bong-tree land\", styled very much in the tradition of the time, plus another two pages about Bong-tree Land itself, reading rather like a nonsensical travel guide, starting,\"Visitors to Bong-tree land must be prepared to travel by sea for a year and a day from almost any port in England.\"Robert Ingpen has captured the essence and style of Edward Lear very nicely, and this provides an unexpected extra tribute to the author. Edward Lear has influenced a host of writers and comedians ever since, including Gilbert and Sullivan, A. A. Milne, Spike Milligan, The Goons, Dr. Seuss and Monty Python's Flying Circus. If you have a penchant for the ridiculous, don't make the mistake of thinking him outdated, and pass Edward Lear by - give him a try. Perhaps he wrote his own epitaph with the words,\"Nonsense is the breath of my nostrils.\""], ["We recently read Miss Smith Under the Ocean, which references a lot of classic tales. Our oldest was intrigued by the mention of the poem of \"The Owl and the Pussycat\", so I borrowed a couple of different picture-book versions of this classic poem so she could hear the whole thing. This version has colorful mixed-media illustrations that are very expressive and abstract. It's very different from Jan Brett's illustrated version of the poem, and we enjoyed comparing the two books. Later on, we read Hilary Knight's interesting take on the story, too.Overall, this classic poem has been illustrated by several different people and we enjoyed reading three of the different versions."], ["I read the version with the illustrations by Wendy Straw and yes, it is a children's book.

As I am a fan of Spike Milligan I found that Edward Lear is right up my alley. The Owl And The Pussycat is a romantic nonsense poem that I found funny and the little one found engaging.

I was also turned off by the owl and \u201cpussy\u201d cat marriage I said to my sister how perverted that was and it put an image in my head that wasn\u2019t pleasant. I always find interspecies mating to be perverse, no matter that these two only got married, it still put an image of the two of them together in my head and might give kids the wrong idea that different animals can mate together, or just put kids to thinking about what the babies would be like and just create all kinds of problems. But the copyright date was 82, the oldest, so I ended up buying it days later. The beautiful pictures with all the different colors is what attracted me to the book because they were pretty to look at.Upon reading the book I\u2019m even more convinced I should\u2019ve stayed away from it. One page in particular had me feeling really weird about it. The one where the owl is singing \u201cO lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are! What a beautiful Pussy you are!\u201d Talk about awkward. Even saying it in my head was embarrassing, saying it out loud to my sister, because I just had to share it with her, even more so!

For one notable example -- there's no pot of honey on the boat, and we never get a look at the money wrapped up in the five-pound note!But there's no denying the beauty of the illustrations, and the Caribbean theme works surprisingly well.

I had read the reviews that likened Wolfe to a voyeur and questioned his motivation in spending years \"observing\" typical college students fifty years his junior. It seemed creepy. But when I saw it in the bargain bin, I couldn't resist, and as it turned out, I couldn't put the thing down. Wolfe is a great writer and storyteller, and although there are some weird things about the book, like his linguistic obsessions over current uses of profanity, he presents a compelling story and a fascinating character in Charlotte. Charlotte, a brilliant student from the impoverished, rural North Carolina, earns a scholarship to the prestigious Dupont University, and dreams of intellectual stimulation unlike she has ever known. Instead, she finds a world of wealth, privilege, and debauchery. Although she wants to play the games of sexual intrigue of her classmates, she has none of the requisite accompanying hardness and cynicism, so her efforts are personally devastating. Wolfe deftly tackles big themes--purity, vanity, greed, social class. He may have gotten some of the details wrong, and if you are currently a college student I'm sure you will find much with which to quarrel, but the bigger story is superb."], ["Wolfe could not seem to decide whether he wanted Charlotte Simmons to be a satire or a legitimate zeitgeist piece. Thus, the characters come off as caricatures to ill effect. Wolfe should take a page from Sinclair Lewis, who somehow managed to write biting satire with still-believable protagonists at the helm. Wolfe could have also gone all out and just made this an absurd piece of literature, but he clearly intended to use this book as a revelation on modern college life.In Wolfe's defense:Though I think there are legitimate criticisms of Charlotte Simmons, the most frequent one, the \"look at how this prude old guy is so freaked out by young people today\" criticism is problematic on several levels. First: it is possible for an author to create an authentic protagonist with whom s/he has little in common. Take Mark Twain's feat of writing from the perspective of a boy in Huck Finn or Sinclair Lewis's believable boob Babbitt in the eponymous book. Wolfe may come from a different generation than his characters, but this does not preclude him from channeling universal emotions through his characters, emotions like self-doubt, alienation, etc.A favorable reviewer on Amazon rightly pointed out that those who criticize Wolfe for not getting this current generation are missing the point. Wolfe is asking the reader to step outside the decadent conventions of this group in order to question why it they are so blindly accepted. To dismiss him because he seems so shocked! by the generation he portrays is to buy into the legitimacy of this (my) generation's norms. Like so many American novels before it, I Am Charlotte Simmons indicts complacent conformity. Perhaps it's easier to recognize these themes in novels where the author is skewering the prudish, straight-laced yesmen rather than the indulgent, counter-traditional ones, but both societies signify rigidity and intolerance towards deviating norms. The pendulum has just shifted in the sense that polite conversation is now quite hospitable to the impolite, but now the diplomat is the odd man out. Being different is hard, whether you're a wandering musician in 1950s America or an intellecutally curious girl from a quiet mountain town in millenial America.My biggest issue: I am most disappointed with how unedited I Am Charlotte Simmons seems at times. Wolfe could have pared this book down a lot. He simply writes too much, sometimes mercilessly belaboring his point. Still, I think the generic criticisms of this book are ignorant of a novel's purpose."], ["Fuck me. I thought everyone was overreacting and being all tight-assed about this book for some reason, and I know one or two people who like this book, so I thought I'd give it a shot, but holy fuck... This book really is an 80 year old white Southern guy's 700+ page rant about kids these days. Tom Wolfe supposedly did years of research for this book to capture the social reality of college, but I guess he was too busy banging undergrads to really pay attention to what was going on around him because this is completely fucking imbecilic on every conceivable level. It bears almost no relationship to social reality. Which is a HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM when you make it your stated goal to be our time's Charles Dickens. Look, I get it, he's asking us to step outside the norms to question the norms, but HE GETS THE NORMS WRONG BECAUSE HE'S A FUCKING DULLARD AND APPARENTLY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING.

Tom Wolfe, responsible for much excellent journalism, has become a worse novelist than Steph Meyer. Good job. This might be the single worst novel I've ever read."], ["Halfway through Tom Wolfe's enormous new novel about contemporary college life, I finally devised a question to keep my interest piqued: \"Is it humanly possible,\" I wondered, \"to write another 100 pages - another 200 pages, another 300 pages - without describing a single surprising event?\"It is.With \"I Am Charlotte Simmons,\" Wolfe has ventured onto the university campus and sent back reams of hyperventilating testimony: College students are slovenly and crude. They drink way too much. They listen to obscene music. They engage in casual and exploitative sex. They put their feet on the furniture - even leather sofas and fine woodwork.But wait, there's more: College students would rather socialize than study. It's all right here, spelled out in tones of amazement, like George H.W. Bush telling us about those new scanners at the grocery store.If you haven't seen \"Animal House\" or anything on the WB, you'll be surprised to learn that collegiate society is divided between \"jocks\" and \"nerds.\" The jocks are very athletic, but not very smart, whereas the nerds are very smart, but not very athletic.Am I going too fast?To write this novel, Wolfe claims that he \"had only to reassemble the material he had accumulated visiting campuses across the country,\" a technique that may explain the book's superficiality. This isn't the anthropology of the Ordinary - a potentially revelatory approach; it's just a dramatization of clich\u00e9s.Even the style lacks Wolfe's usual verve. He's particularly interested in the way modern Americans talk, but in his Rip Van Winkle voice, we get endless explanations and reenactments of what he calls the \"undergraduate vocabulary,\" a discovery he highlights in a brief dedication to his children. Most of the dialogue is written in a profane patois that Wolfe spells out as though he's recording the grunts and clicks of a lost dialect from Inner Mongolia. But he has nothing to add to Norman Mailer's far more daring analysis of American profanity some 40 years ago in \"Armies of the Night.\"Even more tedious than the affected slips of Southern and African-American dialects are his needless parenthetical translations: I can't (cain't) stand them('em). And when characters yell at each other, their words are written in caps so that we know THEY'RE SPEAKING VERY LOUDLY.The story follows the rise and fall of Charlotte Simmons, a brilliant country bumpkin from Sparta, N.C., (pop. 900), who wins a scholarship to Dupont University, one of the most prestigious institutions in the country. Charlotte's parents are simple folk, devout Christians, who have instilled in their daughter a deep sense of morality. They don't drink, swear, put on airs, or take no stock in your highfalutin citified ways. Along with a devoted teacher at school, they have instilled in Charlotte a sense of her exceptionalism that inspires the novel's title, which is also a sort of inspirational mantra for the heroine.Charlotte heads off to Dupont University expecting to enter the august halls of academe, but she quickly finds that it's a brothel, seething with vain, vicious girls and crude, drunken boys. Her snobby roommate won't have anything to do with her. The coed bathrooms are an abomination. Athletes on the basketball team don't take their classes seriously. And hunky frat boys pretend to be interested in your mind, but they're interested in only one thing. (I won't spoil it for you.)Poor Charlotte is consumed with loneliness and confusion. Everyone mocks her clothes, her naivet\u00e9, her virginity, her tee-totaling. Professors recognize her brilliance, but brilliance doesn't matter in this marketplace of drunken flesh. So, how can she resist when the hottest boy on campus asks her to the Spring Formal? (Wolfe Note: The term \"hottest\" is not a reference to the temperature of his body, but to the developed musculature of his body, which, along with a number of male bodies in this book, is described with slobbering attention.)Meanwhile, one of the nerds who works for the school paper (where else?) is pursuing a scandal that could rock American politics, but don't worry about that potentially interesting thread; it never leads off campus - or toward anything.The only issue that develops some traction in this novel is race. Wolfe explored that more profoundly in \"The Bonfire of Vanities\" and \"A Man in Full,\" but his portrayal here of the racial tensions on the college basketball court is engaging. He shows a sport played largely by black men for the entertainment of white fans in an academic setting that contorts its principles to keep the whole industry going.The cynical coach reaps millions; the pasty professor growls about academic standards; the expedient college president maintains an uneasy truce. All these characters play to type, but at the center of this subplot is a white basketball star who feels threatened by the talent and aggression of black players all around him. Why, he wonders, do they have access to a whole range of words and stances that are forbidden to him? What's more, he's starting to feel attracted to a life of the mind that he can just barely imagine. But this minor development is buried in a variety of borrowed plot lines, including a climactic bit of satire about political correctness that might have been sharp 20 years ago.The problem isn't really the inclusion of so many clich\u00e9 characters; sadly, there are plenty of real students who fall into these categories. What's galling about this novel is its persistent lack of nuance, its reduction of the whole spectrum of people on a college campus to these garish primary colors.Wolfe wrote a much discussed essay for Harper's in 1989, \"A Literary Manifesto for the New Social Novel.\" Instead of the cerebral games that now pass for fiction, he argued, American novelists should \"head out into this wild, bizarre, unpredictable, Hog-stomping Baroque country of ours and reclaim it as literary property.\" This is good advice. When he took it, he hog-stomped out two baroque novels, first about New York and then about Atlanta. But cooped up on campus with \"Charlotte Simmons\" he's too predictable and too late to reclaim anything of interest.http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1109/p1..."], ["Any girl who has ever gone through the journey of the small liberal arts big name college will know parts of Charlotte in ways that take them back to times and insecurities that are far better left forgotten. Charlotte, the brain trust of her small town, enters the world of the privledged \"it's mine because I'm entitled to it\" college student. It should be a coming of age tale, and it is but in the twisted way. Charlotte loses herself and every belief she held to fit in from the first day of her freshman year to the last day of her senior. Her uncooth parents embarass her, and so she pushes them away. She is so insecure that she constantly obsesses about what she wears, what she eats, who she is seen with, how she speaks, and with whom she sleeps. After a few months, it's clear that she has lost her identity entirely. My favorite part about this book is what makes it real - disturbing but true - she doesn't come back around. And I think that's a reality. When we lose ourselves, we don't get that self back, we just create a new one. Maybe that new one mimics many parts of the old self, but the new insecurities prevent it from every returning to the original. If you want a pick me up, this is not the book. However, if you have been in this world and want to appreciate how you made it through and appreciate life on the other side, you won't be disappointed."], ["I picked this up at the big garage sale that my work puts on. It caught my eye and I remember being interested in it after reading a review of it when it came out. It's a pretty thick book, over 750 pages, and I didn't plan on reading it for a while. I read the first few chapters when I got home and got very caught up in it. It is one of those books where once you've start reading it, everything else in your life takes a back seat and you can't do anything else but read the book until you're done. Apparently all of Tom Wolfe's books are like that, though I've only read this one. I'll let the New York Times say it better than I can: \"Like everything Wolfe writes, 'I Am Charlotte Simmons' grabs your interest at the outset and saps the desire to do anything else until you finish.\"The book is basically a critique of the current state of higher education and the university lifestyle. The three main characters are students at a Dupont, a fictional prestigious liberal arts school on the east coast and their lives intersect through various plot threads. The title character, Charlotte, is the fish out of water from a small working-class town in West Virginia. She comes to Dupont full of innocence and ideals and the book is propelled by the story of her inevitable fall from grace and eventual redemption. There is one long extended chapter the book about Charlotte going to the big fraternity formal with her new boyfriend and his friends. Wolfe describes what is happening in real time with great detail (both material and emotional), and the result is an incredible and extremely moving piece of writing. If movies that present prom night as an magical evening where everyone's problems are somehow resolved are a zero on the realism scale, Wolfe's description of Charlotte's experience is an easy 10 .One of the things that Wolfe does really well is observe the motivations behind people's words and actions, analyzing people in much the same way that a biologist would study the behavior of animals. To Tom Wolfe, every human interaction is a struggle for dominance, and he makes his case convincingly enough particularly when applied to the seemingly simple but incredibly complex social codes of the fraternities and sororities. Wolfe does stumble occasionally, getting a bit out of his element, particularly when attempting to recreate the dialogue and slang of the black players on the college basketball team. He creates a rapper called Doctor Dis and writes lyrics for his songs in a few cringe-inducing passages. Still, you've got to give an old white guy credit for an attempt. A large part of Wolfe's critique is about class, and the sense of entitlement that well-heeled and well-educated feel. Wolfe lays it on a little too thick in describing Charlotte's humble background, however, and details like Charlotte's family having to use a picnic table inside because they couldn't afford a dining table seemed forced. One final criticism that I'll make is that I though that the end was too neat and sudden. I expected more of a payoff, though I was satisfied enough (if only just to see Charlotte okay again after everything that Wolfe puts her through).This book got a lot of mixed reviews, and some critics really panned it, seeing it as a one of Wolfe's lesser books. I'm not familiar with his other works and with nothing else to compare it to, I was blown away and completely engrossed. I'd strongly recommend it, though only if you can afford to disappear for a week."]], "review_count": "2", "description": "Dupont University--the Olympian halls of learning housing the cream of America's youth, the roseate Gothic spires and manicured lawns suffused with tradition... Or so it appears to beautiful, brilliant Charlotte Simmons, a sheltered freshman from North Carolina. But Charlotte soon learns, to her mounting dismay, that for the uppercrust coeds of Dupont, sex, Cool, and kegs trump academic achievement every time.<br /><br />As Charlotte encounters Dupont's privileged elite--her roommate, Beverly, a Groton-educated Brahmin in lusty pursuit of lacrosse players; Jojo Johanssen, the only white starting player on Dupont's godlike basketball team, whose position is threatened by a hotshot black freshman from the projects; the Young Turk of Saint Ray fraternity, Hoyt Thorpe, whose heady sense of entitlement and social domination is clinched by his accidental brawl with a bodyguard for the governor of California; and Adam Geller, one of the Millennial Mutants who run the university's \"independent\" newspaper and who consider themselves the last bastion of intellectual endeavor on the sex-crazed, jock-obsessed campus--she gains a new, revelatory sense of her own power, that of her difference and of her very innocence, but little does she realize that she will act as a catalyst in all of their lives.", "author": "Tom Wolfe"}, "The Time of the Assassins:  a Study of Rimbaud": {"average_rating": "3.96", "review": [["I read this book about twenty years ago and was reminded of it this morning by another reviewer on Goodreads.On browsing through this now, I had forgotten how interesting this French poet was and I do believe that Henry Miller has done an admirable job here. It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me. I'm off to 'A Season in Hell.'"], ["ONE OF THE BOOKS OF MY LIFE .

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "55", "description": "The social function of the creative personality is a recurrent theme with Henry Miller, and this book is perhaps his most poignant and concentrated analysis of the artist's dilemma.", "author": "Henry Miller"}, "The Long Shadow": {"average_rating": "4.00", "review": [["3.5/5 StarsA highly original debut and a good start to a quartet.A Shadow in Summer is Daniel Abraham\u2019s debut and the first book in the Long Price Quartet series.

However, the average rating on Goodreads speaks for itself already, this is not a book that most readers will enjoy. There aren\u2019t any mythical beings (except for one, I guess), this book contained zero actions, literally zero actions throughout the whole book because the plot revolves heavily around politics, the pacing of the book also moved at an extremely slow pace and I, who loved slow paced books, found it was too slow at times. That said, Abraham\u2019s characters are multi-layered, the engaging yet beautiful prose and the world-building was also excellent. These three factors were very important in making me invested in the book and yes, I am really invested to continue. Not to mention, the concept of andat was incredibly interesting and I can\u2019t wait to see what the series has to offer on this.\n\n\u201cPossibility is a wide field, dear. \u201dCan't\" is a word for small imaginations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite a short book and in my opinion, Abraham has created something super unique in the market with this book and I will continue to the sequel. From the first book alone, I can conclude that A Shadow in Summer is a totally foundational book, making this series a slow burn series; I envision this is also one of those series that only gets better with each installment and I'm going to find out about it immediately.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"], ["When you've read fantasy for as long as I have you get tired of the fact that 90% of fantasy tales revolved around a dumb farm boy who is the missing heir to the kingdom or to long gone magical powers, he has a good heart but can't seem to get the girl, he has to leave home and help the world/nation/kingdom against some Dark Lord, who tends to be archetype and has some old mentor who gives him the sword/magical talisman to win and kick the beejesus out of the Dark Lord. Oh, and then he gets the girl usually or finds someone better than the girl because the girl wasn't a very nice person. Heh. Back then there weren't too many variations on this tale unless you wanted to read Michael Moorcock or maybe H.P. Lovecraft, though, he's more horror than fantasy. Nowadays, fantasy is beginning to shift to grittier/realistic tales; George R.R. Martin being at the forefront. So, now, it isn't about such tales so much and if it is the dumb farm boy might not be such a nice guy or he may lose against the enemy. Maybe, unlike traditional fantasy, someone can wear black and not be a bad person. So, saying all that for those who have walked with the fantasy genre as long as I have, we finally get to encounter a novel that takes another spin. A SHADOW IN SUMMER has a distinctive Asian flair to it with almost no focus on the usual medieval European setting. Moreover, there isn't some Dark Lord to defeat. The tale focuses on politics between various factions within the city of all cities. This city has gained the powers of a powerful spirit that has the ability to give the city a major up in the cotton trade by taking the seed out of cotton plants, thus, giving them a huge advantage upon other cities that need to hand pick the seeds out of each cotton bushel. Naturally, other cities, most notably one similar to a European one, wants to free that spirit or control that spirit so that they can then monopolize the cotton trade. So the whole story is about various groups either trying to do this or about other people investigating this plot, not quite realizing the full details until later. One of the world details I liked about this world and that is based on historical facts is that the people communicate very much in body language rather than words so people will be talking and then take on a pose of apology, love, joy, anger or conciliation. It's definitely a nice touch. So read this book if you like intrigue, court politics and strong characters, who are not the usual archetypes and are actually doing something besides running the from the minions of the Dark Lord.

The society, the empire, is also quite fleshed out and has a character all of its own. I have no complaints with any of that. Indeed, I think it's quite remarkable.I don't even have a problem with the premise, both literally through the magic that this old poet has, or stylistically, or plot-based, that this old man and the empire are one and the same. Both are old, as are quite a few of the main characters, and you can see that they're wracked with guilt and a bit of senility. Rightly so, I might say. Using magic to forcibly abort children with or without the woman's consent is unconscionable, as is a society that has no qualms with enslaving, whether with economics, force, or the Poet's magic of conception.It's rotten, and the death of one is the death of all, and I can't really find it in my heart to feel sad for either.As a novel, it is a beautiful painting, glacially slow and majestic like like the adjective. I think it *IS* beautiful, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good novel.If you don't mind good character studies and an exploration of culpability, duty, justice, and love rather than a modern fantasy yarn full of death and daring and heroism, then I think you might really enjoy this novel.Even now that I've finished it with a sigh and a fairly large undercurrent of regret that it didn't live up to some undefinable promise, I want to like it more than I do. I have great respect for Mr. Abraham already, so it's not like I'm giving up the cause. I'm a fanboy of the Expanse, after all.I know I'll give the other four of this series a shot, but I might not do it right away."], ["Via Book Reviews by Niki Hawkes at www.nikihawkes.comI will be the first one to admit that the overview sounds a little boring and convoluted. The first time I picked it up in a bookstore, I almost disregarded it right away and put it back on the shelf. The reading gods must have been looking out for me that day because for one reason or another I cracked it open to read the first page\u2026 And didn\u2019t stop for thirty minutes. It was fascinating and engaging \u2013 starting out by introducing a complex communication system that involves intricate hand gestures that conveys everything from emotion to social status. And you know what? It only got better! Abraham then went on to developed a mind \u2013 blowing magic system that was as dangerous as it was beautiful. These elements combined with an unforgettable writing style made for one of the most original stories I have ever read!Both the communication and magic systems went a long way to build this world, but Abraham expanded on it anyway and created a stunning city that I can still remember vividly years later. Top that off with an incredible cast of characters (who will have you laughing and crying with them by the time the series ends) and you have one of the most memorable stories on the market. All of the characters were amazing and they only got better with each book.I loved every minute, and I\u2019ll say it again: this was easily one of the best series I\u2019ve ever read. I will definitely be reading it again and will DEFINITELY be buying anything else this author publishes (be on the lookout for my review of The Dragon\u2019s Path \u2013 the first book in Abraham\u2019s latest series \u2013 hitting the blog sometime next month). Outstanding!Recommendations: If you have read all the classics, from Robert Jordan to Brandon Sanderson, and are looking for your next great series, this is definitely the author for you! I recommend him as often as I can because of how profoundly his work affected me. Fantasy fans out there \u2013 this is a must-read!"], ["\u2019And love is more important than justice,\u2019 Seedless said.\u2018Sometimes. Yes.\u2019Seedless smiled and nodded. \u2018What a terrible thought,\u2019 he said. \u2018That love and injustice should be married.\u2019The main merit of A Shadow in Summer lies in how its Author bound ideas into words and then formed them into a language comprehensible for us, ordinary human beings. As to the lives these ideas led, the choices they made, the roads they had taken and the tales that could be told about it - that is altogether a different matter. Abraham\u2019s worldbuilding ideas take us to the world where sophisticated and developed albeit waning civilisation of the East struggles for power with quite primitive and brutish ascendant culture stylised in the western manner. The Summer Cities of the Khainate live off on the scraps of an imperium gone by. They are still resplendent, still rich beyond measure, overflowing with goods and pleasures; each of them independent and yet interdependent - immersed in the ebbs and flows of international trade. Arrogant yet secure in their frivolities by the powers wielded by poets. For you see, only the poet is able to grasp and then hold the andat. What is the andat? Andat are like thoughts made real, ideas tamed and given human shape, thoughts translated by the poet into a form that includes volition, more difficult to hold each time they escape. Inevitably, the more scarce they become, the greater treasure they were. Especially that when faced with the raw but crude power of other nations, the cities of the East had the andat as their ultimate and only weapons. \u201cI am a slave, my dear. The slave you hope to own.\u201dI admit, I thought the idea of the andat ingenious in its simplicity. But Mr Abraham surpassed all my expectations when like a fine wordsmith, he wrought a form for his idea and then breathed life into it creating Seedless. Seedless, neither the slave nor a puppet and a little bit of both, simultaneously compassionate god and malefic prankster, neither a monster nor a beast and yet so very elemental and inhuman, is a character so total that he could wander through the pages of Dostoyevsky or Mann, if any of them ever bothered to write fantasy, and never would be out of place.\u2018I think we\u2019re past things like forgiveness,\u2019 she said. \u2018We\u2019re the servants of what we have to do.\u2019This is so precisely because characterisation is the second pillar elevating A Shadow in the Summer above the average. It is not merely the gallimaufry of protagonists. The art lies in how with each word they gain depth and colour, how the cardboard figures absorb conventional tropes and fold them into intricate shapes. This book is like a human origami. You know I look askance at cliches. But here cliches flare with new life; the coming-to-age, the star-crossed lovers, the late lovers, the love triangle, the revenge, the from wares to whores (aka. the bordello tycoon trope), the master-apprentice, the younger son - you will find them all in this novel. But don\u2019t greet them like old friends - they will be as surprising as they are disturbing and inconvenient. Each of the protagonists stumbles upon the very bedrocks of their own personalities and things that render them unique prove to be both a blessing and a curse. This was the main reason why I couldn\u2019t fully connect with any of the heroes and heroines. They were endearing and annoying at once. Too much like the living people, like us: hard to classify, impossible to pigeonhole. None of them has come out whole from the adventure, none emerged strengthened and refined. Not something you usually get in fantasy, more frequently these types of personal stories are found among the classic novels. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a killer. I\u2019m a poet. If we\u2019re going to stop this thing, one of us has to change.\u201dAmong all the characters Amat definitely stands out. It might be that I have a soft spot for elder women in a genre conquered by hordes of cocky adolescents. More probably though, it is how masterfully her arc was written; she reminds me Bujold's characters from the World of the Five Gods. In a word where action only complements a word and the form it has taken, she is a shining supernova. I really loved how in this book language is more than words. The protagonists communicate via countless poses and each message has a double, sometimes even triple meaning. Speaking is never reduced to merely talking: \u201cHe answered with a pose so gentle and complex - thankfulness, requesting patience, expressing affection - that it neared poetry.\u201d I was taking poses as I read on! I also appreciated how the tale gives a laudation of conceived life, regardless of its form and stage. What are the weaknesses then, you ask? While the personal stories and arc are superb, the overall plot is convoluted and a bit artificial. The personal stories touch but do not meet head-on. They tangle, but the pattern they form is haphazard, inchoate and disjointed. Furthermore, the whole stratagem develops very slowly and not without bizarre hurdles. The balance between what happens, the meanings the events are supposed to carry and then the actual weight of the narrative lacks equilibrium. Not deeply enough nuanced tension between the lack of free will and the lack of freedom, the general nature of the andat versus the specificity of a flawed design, inconclusive character development of the supposedly main hero built on a twisted sense of loyalty and justice, especially when juxtaposed with his initial rejection of a system that demanded cruelty from him up to the breakup point and lauded him for the breaking - all this together meant that when I finished the book and I was both satisfied and dissatisfied, very disturbed and unsure what to make of the whole story. I was torn and conflicted in my rating between 3 and 4 stars, but taking into consideration the avalanche of reflections this book has awakened in me, I give it a benefit of depth and raise my rating. A Shadow in Summer is definitely worthy of your attention. However, you need to judge very carefully if the novel is actually for you as it does not cater to all the customary needs of an average fantasy reader. Despite its shortages, I am taking a pose of invitation and encouragement. Bonus: Read Q&A with Daniel Abraham on Fantasy Buddy Reads. Also in the series: 2. A Betrayal in Winter3.

I had no idea what to expect, but I was blown away by how different and complex the plot of this fascinating story offers. If you are expecting a traditional Fantasy with some political jostling in it, you have the wrong book. This is not at all in the realm of the Fantasy I have known up to now. Yes, we have a world of imagination, a city-state made strong by flourishing trade, while the trade itself is supported by the poet-sorcerers and their bonded spirit-slaves. The sorcerers are called poets, because they form the physical representation of an idea and give it to a spirit called Andat, the boundaries of whom are given by how precise the poem and the character of the poet craft it. It is definitely a double-edged sward, since even if the poet believes to have crafted a spirit with only positive and perfect virtues, if there is pain, envy, hatred, or any other such negative intent in the heart of the creator and it bleeds into the poem, something very dangerous comes through into the spirit. Such is the case with Seedless. He is and Andat, given shape and bonded by the poet Heshai, who feels inferior and holds a lot of hatred and negativity in his heart, but wanted to give shape to perfection in Seedless, the way he thought perfection should be. However, completely without meaning it, Heshai infused Seedless with all of his hate and negativity as well, so he is so much evil, bundled up in a perfect physical form. \n\"...\u201cSometimes the hand pulls the puppet, sometimes the puppet pulls the hand, but the string runs both ways.\u201d...\"\nSuch is the case that the city-state of Saraykeht, the most powerful city among the Summer Cities, counts on its poets and the Andats they wield for their crops to be abundant and plenty and for the health of the state to be in balance. No one could foresee an Andat hating its bonds and bondage so much, that is willing to kill itself by destroying the poet and the well-being of the city it was supposed to protect and favor. And it all starts rolling with a forced abortion of a baby who's mother had no idea of the evil about to be perpetuated on her. \n\"...\u201cTo lose everything is not the worst can happen.\"\"It's starting again, from nothing, with nothing,\" Otah said.\"Is exactly this,\" Maj agreed, then a moment later. \"Starting again, and doing better.\u201d ...\"\nThe government of Galt is set on destroying and taking over Saraykeht. Marchat Wilsin is the head of a Galt trading house and Amat, a woman in her fifties with a bad hip and sharp wit is House Wilsin's business manager. Marchat Wilsin is knees deep together with Seedless in the plot to take down the city, no matter the means. Shen Amat finds out, she decides to expose them and slowly gathers information. Just as involved, although unknowingly and unwittingly, are the student poet Maati, the laborer young man Itani (also known as Otah), and his lover, Amat's apprentice Liat, my least favorite character of them all. They all have a place in the intricacies of a story woven from political intrigues, power struggles and machinations, no battles or sword-fights involved at all. For a book having no action sequences and full of just character building and plotting, this was one of the most enthralling books I have read in a while. I was not bored even for a second. And the richness of the world and characters was beautiful and varied. I would recommend this to all who appreciate just plain good writing!!! Give it a try! \n\"...\u201cI'm going to sleep.

Which is odd because I think I'm the first one to complain when Fantasy or Sci-Fi books don't have any action and move slow. Others thought that of this book but it wasn't that way for me.

Illness also makes me so lazy, such that I was unwilling to move even though I'd hunched down into a painful sitting/crouching/fetal position. Despite that (and despite the visual trumpet-blare of the pompous title fonts, and my current aversion to epics) this was an incredible fantasy story. I skipped ahead and around to follow a character's storyline, just because it was so fascinating. I just finished stumbling through the last bits of the 4 books and I'm going to have to get over my epic aversion to re-read this all properly someday. I would give this series more than 4 stars, a little less than 5 stars.10 generations ago (which isn't actually all that long, is it? a few hundred years?) an empire fell and now its remnants, called the Summer Cities, still dominate the world with its wealth, based on a fraction of the power it once had. This power comes from control of creatures called andats, 'ideas given volition' is the description from the book I think, that are created by poets; not those laureates who speak at inaugurations or publish slim volumes or, ahem, rhyme stuff (\"Stop it! I mean it!\" \"Would anybody like a peanut?\" \u2013 that's my kind of poetry), but scholars who strive to completely capture a concept with a special grammar meant for this purpose and hold it in their minds, bending it to their will...magic. The andat takes on the form and personality imagined by the poet, an embodiment of the creator's mind. Unfortunately, once caught and lost, the exact same idea can't be recaptured. If you try, you die. The grammar has to be adjusted to describe it differently if possible; as the years go on, it becomes impossible to find a unique description and the andat, the idea, has to be abandoned. It's possible to bestow an andat upon another person, another poet. Each of the cities has its own poet, each andat's power used to boost the particular trade that is the basis of each city's economy.The Summer Cities culture is obviously drawn from Asia, with the almond eyes and teahouses, but how beautiful the added touches are! Letters having edges sewn with silk thread are tucked into sleeves; firekeepers maintain braziers along major thoroughfares during cold months; the language consists of as many gestures as words; the suffix -kvo is used for teachers, -cha for respect, and -kya for great affection \u2013 grace notes in this wicked awesome story. And man, can this author write. Too many lines that made me pause to appreciate, even in a feverish haze. I wish I had the head to remember quotes to share them, but all I remember is the lift that comes from knowing something is very good.This first book introduces the world (building it, hah). It begins at the poet school where we learn how they attempt to select the right people to potentially wield andats. Then fast-forward to a young poet sent to one of the cities to be ready to take on the residing poet's andat when the time comes. A plot to destroy the current poet is revealed to be just a feeler. Threading around the plot are all the human relations that complicate everything. There is the expected love triangle, whatever, but better is the delicate hum of Marchat and Amat. Wonderful and quietly sad. Anyway, the feeler plot felt flabby and small until it swelled to include nations and then gut-punches a reader with a series of, uh, punches. In the gut. That final sentence, wow. It's like the whole book was an orchestra just before a performance, sawing bows and turning knobs, an oddly harmonious dissonance (heh, I know, dumb, but when the strings are tuning and don't quite match but all sound like a piece of silk running up your back...that!), and at the last sentence the conductor dramatically raises his baton...."], ["[4.. maybe a 3.75 stars]So if I need to describe this first book in 2 words I would say: Original and ClinicalOriginal, because let's be honest it's nothing like other fantasy novels I've read, the magic system is about capturing \"ideas\" into humanoid forms called \"Andat\" and control them to do the bidding of the castor, however these forms develop somewhat human traits and emotions as well, cue instant interesting and favorite character! The world building is also very engaging with a lot of oriental and Asian influences (can we take a second to appreciate those beautiful covers?! Kudos to Stephanie Martiniere).The plot is politics and economy-heavy which and completely action-free, which you don't see much of, if ever, in fantasy. This could be a big hit or miss for readers as the plot can be very slow-paced at times (cue audiobook to speed things up!), I won't call it slow-burn for now because that implies that they are great things to happen and I don't know that yet. However, this series seems like one that only gets better and better with each book, so look forward for 3 more reviews!Why clinical? Well you'd think the slow-nothing-is-happening pace is the reason of the low-ish rating I gave, I actually like well done slow-burn books *cough*RobinHobb*cough*. This one though was kind of a miss regarding the presentation of the characters. Don't get me wrong they are all interesting and engaging to read about, Otah and Seedless are my absolute favorite, Amat is a middle aged woman who is a BAMF that gets shit done and Maati is a precious child that you want to smack every once in a while and hug the rest of the time, Liat can go expire in a ditch for all I care but she is a very realistic 17 years old girl. Not to mention a plethora of other rich charatersSo all of the above had great distinct characterization, but I just wasn't attached to any of them. We would get description of all these horrible things that happened to them and I'm like too bad bro..So that was a bit disappointing for someone like me who likes to get destroyed and left traumatized after finishing a book..So all in all, I recommend this book for someone who is bored with all the mainstream fantasy and would like to experience something new. I am DEFINITELY going to continue with the series because ANDATS! and because I really really liked the world and I am hopefully that my attachment issues with the characters will improve as the series advances.Buddy Read with  my best-book-friend Petrik who always tries to keep me sane when I\u2019m in full geek-out mode :\u2019D"], ["I really liked the writing and the concept of \"poets\" giving literal shape and form to ideas.

Long"}, "A Treasury of Kahlil Gibran": {"average_rating": "4.43", "review": [["The Treasured Writings of Khalil Gibran is a comprehensive collection of pretty much everything Gibran wrote during his lifetime. As such, it is a very large book\u2014containing 902 pages. I've been reading this 'on the side', while reading other, lighter books. While the size of the book may be intimidating to some readers, I have found that it is best read one or two short pieces at a time. This is partly because taking it slowly will allow the reader to reflect upon the text, and partly because Gibran's writing is so amazingly approachable that it can be picked up any time without worrying about missing anything. The book is comprised of several separate sections: Tears and laughter, Between night and morn, Secrets of the heart, Spirits rebellious, The broken wings, The voice of the master, Thoughts and meditations, A self-portrait, Mirrors of the soul, and The wisdom of Khalil Gibran. Among the texts are interspersed Gibran's poems, which I was not familiar with. How does one define Gibran's writing? Or. rather, the question should be whether Gibran's writing allows definition at all. At times, one feels that he is reading a philosophical thesis on humanity. Other times, it reads like a religious text dictated by a prophet to his followers. And still, the poetry speaks of the soul of a poet in the traditional sense inasmuch as one perceives a deeply understanding soul must have written the lines on the pages. Gibran's work may sound intimidating, but it is far from it. It is easily the most approachable philosophical text\u2014one written in an eloquent and intelligible way that allows the reader to grasp the master's message and pondering. Gibran is often labeled a prophet (not only due to his work The Prophet), and the label is strangely befitting. He is not, however, a prophet of doom. Rather, Gibran embraces nature and humanity, and he sees hope in places where I would personally never bothered looking. He is contagiously optimistic, and even when he chastises, it comes across as an encouragement. For he truly encourages people to look not only around them, but also deep inside themselves and seek peace. Whether one follows him on his musings through the Lebanese cedars, or atop a mountain while hiding from a tempest, Gibran is the light in the end of a tunnel, a guiding hand, and a father who comforts. \"Yesterday we were, and today we are!\" Gibran says in one of the many masterpieces. A simple, yet powerful message. We are, we exists, we are aware. \"Yesterday we were a toy in the hands of Destiny. But today Destiny has awakened from her intoxication to play and laugh and walk with us. We do not follow her but she follows us.\" \"Wisdom is not in words; Wisdom is meaning within words.\" Gibran's words do not hide wisdom\u2014they spread it right before your very eyes, from the first page to the last. My words, however, struggle to portray what this book is and what it means. Gibran's writing is universal and dated in a beautiful way that makes it timeless. His words are a blessing, a comforting voice in the darkness of humanity. Highly recommended."], ["If you want something to draw inspiration from on a daily basis, this should be in a place you can access it every single day.

You are already zapped of energy. You feel like going to a bar and have a couple of beer listening to a funky live band or the crooning of a lovely young lady. Or you want to go to a nearby mall and sit in the comfort of a dark movie house. Probably sleep to rest for a couple of hours if the movie turns out to be boring.But you decide to go as you planned at the start of the day. Your gym bag is in your car. You drag your heavy feet to the parking lot. To the gym. You know you have to do it your friend has been telling you that Henry James is good but you imagine the taste of cold beer quenching your thirst or the soft seat inside the theater or the pretty songbird wearing a plunging neckline or showing her slim smooth legs there are quick reads waiting for you like Ray Bradbury\u2019s Farenheit 451 or that Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes. But you know your body needs exercise. You are becoming fatter, heavier and your waistline is expanding. You resisted the quick but empty lure of beer or sleep at the movie house. Your heart is telling you that Henry James is an author to read. Like a zombie, you continued sleepwalking to the gym.After changing to your gym attire. You step on the treadmill. The solitude of working out. In the gym, you rarely talk to anyone. Henry James used a style that was distinctively his: wordy yet illuminating You are by yourself. Most of your friends don\u2019t care about Henry James. You begin to walk. Warm up. After a couple of minutes, you increase the speed. Chug. Chug. Chug. It goes on and on. His storytelling went on and on. His characters came from New York, to England, went to Paris, then to Rome and then went back to England and finally went back to Rome. After the treadmill, you lift some weights as you also need to tone some muscles. His characters were varied. There was Isabel Archer fighting for her independence by refusing marriage proposals like there was not tomorrow but in the end she found with the wrong man: conceited, two-timer, treacherous and condescending. Some muscles are not supposed to be exercised right after a neighboring one. They could be contradicting each other and not only you will not get the maximum benefit from your workout but you are in the danger of having an injury like some pulled muscles. Isabel\u2019s cousin Ralph Touchett is the \u201cconscience\u201d of the novel, telling by instinct whether the person-character is good or bad. He is sick but he is the only character that has the purest heart.You came to the gym gloomy and dragged your feet as you did not have the energy even to go up a couple of stairs. Some people agonize reading this kind of 19th century Victorian English But when you came out to go back to your car, you felt energized and refreshed. You felt triumphant that Isabel Archer was going back to Rome for Pansy not necessarily for Oswald. But she decided whatever her heart was telling her. In the end, it was all that mattered: independence. She followed her heart: a personal triumph.  In the end, you did not regret going to the gym. In the end, I am happy I read a Henry James."], ["10 Things I Love About Henry James\u2019s The Portrait Of A Lady1. Isabel ArcherThe \u201clady\u201d in the title. Beautiful, young, headstrong and spirited, the American woman visits her wealthy relatives in England, rejects marriage proposals by two worthy suitors, inherits a fortune and then is manipulated into marrying one of the most odious creatures on the planet, Gilbert Osmond. She\u2019s utterly fascinating, and if I were back in university, I imagine having long conversations and arguments about her character. What does she want: Freedom? The ability to choose, even if it\u2019s a bad choice? Is she a projection of James\u2019s latent homosexuality? Is she a feminist or not? There are no simple answers. 2. The Prose and Psychological ComplexityDamn, James knew how to write long, luxuriant sentences that dig deep into his characters\u2019 minds. Sometimes the effect can be claustrophobic \u2013 get me out of this person\u2019s head! \u2013 but more often it\u2019s utterly compelling and convincing. We partly read fiction to learn about other people\u2019s lives, right? Well, James does that. (The exceptions: Isabel\u2019s two wealthy, handsome suitors, Warburton and Goodwood, are less than believable, and remind me of eager (or horny?) dogs, their tails wagging whenever they\u2019re around their love/lust object.)3. The StoryOkay, not much really happens. But as the book progressed, even though I sort of knew the outcome (it\u2019s hard to avoid spoilers from a 135-year-old classic), I was increasingly curious to see how Isabel would act. In fact, I raced through the final chapters, breathlessly. Who knew: Henry James, page-turner! And have a theory about that ending? Take your turn...4. The HumourIt\u2019s not a comedy, but there are lots of amusing bits. James\u2019s narrator is genial and funny. Henrietta Stackpole, her gentleman friend, Mr. Bantling, and even Gilbert Osmond\u2019s sister, the Countess Gemini, are all very colourful characters who elicit a chuckle or two. And Isabel\u2019s aunt can be terribly cutting as well. I love Ralph (Isabel's cousin) and the dignified British Lord Warburton\u2019s reactions to the enterprising, no-fuss American \u201clady journalist\u201d Henrietta. 5. The SettingsEach one is significant: from the stately Gardencourt, home of Isabel\u2019s relatives the Touchetts, to the bustle and anonymity of London, to the ruins of Rome, where Isabel finds herself stuck in a dead, fossilized marriage. James is a master at finding the right place to stage a scene. I could write an essay about interiors and exteriors in the book, but I\u2019ll spare you.6. The VillainsMadame Merle and Gilbert Osmond: individually they\u2019re sinister, but together they\u2019re positively Machiavellian. In fact, in one scene, it\u2019s revealed that they both like Machiavelli, and Isabel doesn\u2019t get the clue! They totally play her. And yet they\u2019re believable, too. Osmond\u2019s scene in which he professes his love is brilliant in its manipulation; and the final turn of the screw (asking her to do him a favour!) is very clever. Madame Merle\u2019s motivations always keep you guessing. Does she see herself in Isabel? Is she jealous? Does she just want to exert her power over her? The scene in which Isabel sees both in her home, conspiring (evident from their attitudes) is so powerful James refers to it a couple of times. And of course, it\u2019s missing from the Jane Campion film (see below).7. The ThemesDoes money corrupt? What do you really know about someone before you marry? What is the true nature of freedom? What happens when New World (American) \"innocence\" meets Old World (European) \"experience\"? All these themes \u2013 and many others \u2013 come across naturally, and never feel shoe-horned into the story.8. The TechniqueI remember hearing people go on about the architecture of Henry James\u2019s novels, and this one is sturdily, handsomely built. The book begins and ends in the same setting. And there are some ingenious sections in the middle, where time has passed and the reader discovers major information through conversations. Like any great writer, James knows what to leave out. He makes you do work to fill in the pieces, but the novel becomes more memorable because of that. And he bridges the Victorian and Modern eras, in the same way that Beethoven bridges the Classical and Romantic eras.9. Chapter 42After a huge blowup with Osmond, Isabel stays up all night, staring into the fireplace, and ponders her life, thinking: \"How did I get here?\" James considered it one of the best things he\u2019d ever written, and although I haven\u2019t read a lot of his work (which I will soon remedy), I\u2019d have to agree. It\u2019s right up there with Hamlet\u2019s soliloquies.10. The Fact that the Book Doesn't Lend Itself Well To Adaptation A couple days after finishing the book, I watched the Campion film starring Nicole Kidman. Besides an evocative score and a brilliant performance by Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle and a suitably slimy one by John Malkovich (basically changing costumes from his Dangerous Liaisons character), it was dreadfully dull. There have been other James adaptations \u2013 The Wings Of The Dove, The Golden Bowl, The Bostonians \u2013 but none of these films has achieved the critical or popular success of an Age Of Innocence, Howards End or Room With A View. Maybe it's hard to get that psychological complexity onscreen? Read the books.***Conclusion: James is The Master. Up til now, I\u2019d only read his shorter works, like the novellas \u201cThe Turn Of The Screw,\u201d \u201cDaisy Miller\u201d (I still don\u2019t quite know what killed her - sorry if that\u2019s a spoiler) and \u201cThe Beast In The Jungle.\u201d Now I\u2019m eyeing his other major novels; perhaps I\u2019ll even get through the notoriously difficult late period James. Can't wait to try!"], ["For my dear friend Jeffrey Keeten: I would not have read it if it were not for you. Thanks! Henry James\u2019 The Portrait of a Lady touched me deeply. Since I finished this novel a few days ago, I could not seem to stop thinking about it as I tried to organize my feelings. That I was mesmerized by it, there is no doubt. So much that the search for its understanding has occupied practically all my free moments. And to fully grasp it I could not do without Henry James masterful help, so forgive me if you find I quote him too often. Oh, but this is a work in progress, so forgive me again for any inaccuracy or inconsistency. 1. The complexity of Isabel Archer\n\"Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The novel is of its very nature an ado, an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for\u2014for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.\"\nPortrait of a Lady is the story of a young American woman, Isabel Archer, and her voyage of self-discovery. I loved getting into Isabel's conflicted mind, her doubts and her confidence, her wishes and her choices. I went even further and identified thoroughly with Isabel Archer. I could relate to her conflicted mind, her dreams and ultimate choices. She was a pleasure to know, because she is so extraordinarily complex, complex in a way that fictional people seldom are.From the first we learn how Isabel valued her freedom, in a dialogue with her cousin Ralph:\n\"\u2018Adopted me?\u2019 The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain...\u2018Oh no; she has not adopted me. I\u2019m not a candidate for adoption.\u2019\u2018I beg a thousand pardons,\u2019 Ralph murmured. \u2018I meant... \u2018You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up... but,\u2019 she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, \u2018I\u2019m very fond of my liberty.\u2019\"\nThe secondary characters are there to explain Isabel Archer, as Henry James tells us \u201cthey are there, for what they are worth\u2026 the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer\u2019s history. I recognized them, I knew them, they were numbered pieces of my puzzle, the concrete term of my \u2018plot\u2019.\u201dMrs. Touchett, her aunt, brings Isabel to Europe but is indifferent and unfeeling; Ralph is initially amused by her and helps her to inherit a fortune, only to guarantee her choices and the freedom to follow them (he probably is the only one that thoroughly loved Isabel); Madam Merle manages her meeting with Osmond and makes sure they end up married; Osmond thinks of her as one more item for his collection; Mr. Goodwood is persistent and never loses interest in her life (coming back again and again to see how she is), but seems to offer nothing more; Lord Warburton is a fair aristocratic friend to Isabel, but was he truly in love with her or merely looking for a trophy wife?; Henrietta Stackpole, is a true friend and probably an antithesis to Isabel; and Pansy, the artless creation of her husband, depends on Isabel as the only person who throughly loves her. So everyone, including the reader, look upon her, judge her decisions and contemplate as she takes each of her fateful steps into her destiny.Oh, there is much more about Isabel, and I hope I will be able to know her better once I am finished.2. The images and metaphors of Isabel Archer\u2019s lifeTo discuss this I first I want to tell you about a recurrent dream I had for a very long time. Sometimes, I dreamed that I was walking down the corridor on my home and discovered a door I had never realized existed; deciding to explore I would open it and it led me to a new, endless row of rooms, all grand with high windows and sunny, overlooking majestic gardens that I had never observed existed before. As I opened each door amazing new discoveries were revealed to me. My feelings were of exuberance, of happiness to have discovered so much beauty inside my home. But there was a variation to these recurrent dreams, or worst, there were also nightmares. In these I also discovered new places never visited before, however they would be dark and looked nowhere. As a result of this oppressive atmosphere I used to feel like I was in an endless prison inside my own home. I rejoiced in the first and feared to revisit those nightmares.So, when I started reading The Portrait of a Lady, it was fascinating to read how Henry James uses symbolic or metaphorical architectural spaces and places to tell us about Isabel Archer and her life. This was something I knew and it remitted directly to my dreams and my deepest self. \n\"Her imagination was by habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging.\"\nWe first meet Isabel at Gardencourt,\n\"Her uncle\u2019s house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. The large, low rooms, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a \u2018property\u2019\u2014...much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions\"\nBy marrying Osmond Isabel ends up enveloped in a palace dark and suffocating:\n\"She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of suffocation. Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air; Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her.\"\nThere, she seeks refuge or consolation on the ruins of Rome, for her a symbol of hope for despite their long sufferings they are still standing.\n\"She had long before this taken old Rome into her confidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places, so that as she sat in a sun-warmed angle on a winter\u2019s day, she could smile at it and think of its smallness.\"\nBut, ultimately, she seeks refuge once more at Gardencourt.\n\"All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desire too save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge. Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth in her strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place had been a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now.\"\n3. Isabel\u2019s choices and freedomIsabel's ability to choose, and the choices she makes are the thread that is carefully woven throughout the novel, and it raises her stature as a fictional heroine, in my opinion, to the level of that of an Anna Karenina or an Emma Bovary. For better or for worse. \n\"\u2018I\u2019m not bent on a life of misery,\u2019 said Isabel. \u2018I\u2019ve always been intensely determined to be happy, and I\u2019ve often believed I should be. I\u2019ve told people that. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself.\u2019\u2018By separating yourself from what?\u2019\u2018From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer.\u2019\"\nThe moment Isabel inherits starts the process whereupon she loses some of her freedom\u2026\n\"There\u2019s one remarkable clause in my husband\u2019s will,\u2019 Mrs Touchett added. \u2018He has left my niece a fortune.\u2019\u2018A fortune!\u2019 Madame Merle softly repeated.\u2018Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds.\u2019Madame Merle\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, still clasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, a little dilated... \u2018Ah,\u2019 she cried, \u2018the clever creature!\u2019\"\nAnd around Isabel there is always a sense of danger: \n\"\u2018I try to care more about the world than about myself\u2013\u2013but I always come back to myself. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 She stopped; her voice had trembled a little. \u2018Yes, I\u2019m afraid; I can\u2019t tell you. A large fortune means freedom, and I\u2019m afraid of that. It\u2019s such a fine thing, and one should make such a good use of it. If one shouldn\u2019t one would be ashamed... I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not a greater happiness to be powerless.\u2019\"\nBut was she really free or were her choices not as free as she dreamed? Or was it all inevitable to some degree? It seems that Isabel Archer's life was to some extend inescapable and this fact was not totally unknown to her. However, she thoroughly recongnizes how misguided she had been in her choice of husband. \n\"It was as if he had had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune. Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him? This mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life; a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered.\"\nSubsequentely, Isabel remains too proud to show it to the her friends. But despite all her efforts to conceal her misery, she cannot camouflage it from Ralph and Caspar: \n\"\u2018Watching her?\u2019\u2018Trying to make out if she's happy.\u2019\u2018That's easy to make out,\u2019 said Ralph. \u2018She\u2019s the most visibly happy woman I know.\u2019\u2018Exactly so; I\u2019m satisfied,\u2019 Goodwood answered dryly. For all his dryness, however, he had more to say. \u2018I\u2019ve been watching her. She pretends to be happy; that was what she undertook to be; and I thought I should like to see for myself what it amounts to. I\u2019ve seen,\u2019 he continued with a harsh ring in his voice, \u2018and I don\u2019t want to see any more. I\u2019m now quite ready to go.\u2019\"\nSorrowful and heartbroken, that's how this passage made me feel. But she is never to be pitied, she always stands upright despite doomed adversity. Yes, I suspect there is a sense of inevitability (what choices did she have, where her other suitors conductive of real happiness? I think not!) which could have made Isabel Archer\u2019s into a tragedy. But she is far from it, she still has choices. Nevertheless, James\u2019 work is not merely that. It is a reflection upon the ideal of a relative freedom and a play with its execution in a woman\u2019s life; the actions, its struggles and the consequent decisions taken by choice. This is what James has achieved with this work; that liberty is not only an ideal but a responsibility too. Though the reader may not approve of all her choices at the end, keeping in mind the betrayal of trust brought about by Madam Merle and Osmond, they were all freely taken or the result of her own will. A will which comes not merely from the limitations imposed by society, but by a newfound maturity, result of all her suffering, and above all from the vow to remain true to oneself. 4. Henry James gives the reader plenty of room to imagineThere\u2019s something about Henry James\u2019 work, and here in particular, that flares, tosses back and forth with unspoken frustration and desire. James\u2019 art, the one thing that makes him stand out for me, is in how he somehow implies, suggests, hints, but never outright tells the reader the ins and outs of his story. He even skips years, and it only adds to its enjoyment. If you want to live along with Isabel Archer, and I felt like I did, is to be conquered by infinite possibilities. Here we are not mere spectator or bystanders but may live everything along with her, if we want to. It is a hard reading that requires effort, but if we invest in it we can grasp the possibilities the whole world that exists beneath the surface of his work.5. Her ultimate choiceIsabel falls for Gilbert Osmond, to my mind, partly because he does not mindlessly adore her, does not fawn over her. He takes his time in the courtship, he (with the help of Madame Merle) has a clear strategy and it works. He is mysterious, indolent; and there is the hint of a darker side. He appears to be tired of everything, simply bored, so Isabel feels like for once she is helping somebody. That her inheritance has a meaning, a destiny. She seems to feel recompensated and fulfilled.\n\"...\u2018What has he ever done?\u2019 he added abruptly.\u2018That I should marry him? Nothing at all,\u2019 Isabel replied while her patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. \u2018If he had done great things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr Goodwood; I\u2019m marrying a perfect nonentity. Don\u2019t try to take an interest in him. You can\u2019t.\u2019\"\nAnd we are not the only ones to be surprised by her choice to marry Gilbert Osmond. Ralph was appalled:\n\"\u2018I think I\u2019ve hardly got over my surprise,\u2019 he went on at last. \u2018You were the last person I expected to see caught.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know why you call it caught.\u2019\u2018Because you\u2019re going to be put into a cage.\u2019\u2018If I like my cage, that needn\u2019t trouble you,\u2019 she answered....\u2018You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.\u2019\"\nBut she still has another choice ahead of her. Her ultimate choice is whether or not to return to Osmond after she goes to Gardencourt to visit her dying cousin. Again Henry James gifts us with a superb image that could not translate better the pervading dread of what she is about to do:\n\"There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started.\"\nAnd at last we understand her ultimate decision, although such resolution is not easily reached. \n\"There were lights in the windows of the house; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time\u2014for the distance was considerable\u2014she had moved through the darkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then she put her hand on the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a very straight path.\"\nIn the end I recognized a worthier and more mature Isabel Archer, and I think that she comes out of her sufferings stronger. I would like to imagine Osmond would be surprised by her when she gets back to Rome, and that she would be able to change her standing. Their roles perhaps altered. Although there should certainly be more anguish ahead of her, given what she is going back to, I imagine there is always the possibility of happiness.______"], ["I've been reading a lot of Anthony Trollope's books recently and the stories, characters and writing is so much superior to this that I just can't get into it. \"Frothy\" is a word that comes to mind, also \"was he paid by the word?\" like Dickens. I finished the book, finally. It was a chore. I did not find James' portrayal of a woman's personality convincing. That even though she had the financial power which was the reason why her husband had married her, she would still allow herself to be physically and emotionally abused and humiliated. It seemed to be a very conventional view of a woman, that eventually she would give in to her Lord and Master. A woman with an ounce of independence (she did have an ounce, maybe even two) at the beginning would not be the sad creature she was at the end. Marriages were made in light of money and status in those times, in this book, she had both, he had neither, there had to be some sort of mental shift that that would allow her to pretend that these were her husband's and she was in the lower and grateful position. But James didn't write it, so 'Portrait' really didn't make sense.None of the characters, evil, good or milk-water gained my sympathy. Pansy, the daughter, nearly did, but I wanted to shake her and say 'how could you have lived all these years and not suspected who your mother is? Your father has palmed you off on the nuns all these years, what's with this unquestioning obedience? Its your step-mother has the money, not him, she's the one who can help you, would help you,not your daddy who just wants you to achieve his own social-climbing ambitions'. I just don't see James as a man who understood women enough to write about them from any but a man's perspective.I watched the Nichole Kidman film of the book and although Kidman did her best to flesh out the character she was no more rounded than in the book. And Poppy's submissiveness and ignorance were even more unbelievable. Obviously, to James, the main characteristic he associated with women and interpreted thusly by the director, was submissiveness.Henry James may have deserved his reputation as a Grand Old Man of (American) letters, but not through this book, it just didn't do it for me."], ["I had many wonderful moments while reading this book, moments when the writing halted the reading, when I had to pause and admire and wonder. Moments when the book seemed to speak to my own experience as if it were written expressly for the girl who was me at twenty-two, causing me to wonder how Henry James could have guessed so well the presumptuous ideas I had about life and love at that early stage. All of that is very personal, of course, and not necessarily of interest to other readers, but there were other moments in my reading of The Portrait of a Lady that better merit mention in a review. I had read this book before, about twenty years ago, so although I knew the bare bones of the story, I remembered few of the details. I certainly had no recollection of the early scene in which Isabel Archer walks in on an unknown guest in her aunt\u2019s house. And yet there was something about the lead-up to that scene that caught my attention this time: the house is very still because Isabel\u2019s uncle is dying. Out of the silence comes the sound of someone playing the piano. Wonderingly, Isabel makes her way toward the source of the harmony. Those six words were like a bell ringing in my mind. I felt a sharpening of interest, an awareness of how pivotal this moment would be in the story. I remember thinking: I've been reading this book with all senses on alert and this is my reward; I've sensed the author\u2019s excitement at the turn his story is about to take. There was another scene later in the book when I had a similar feeling of change about to happen: Isabel sits up late one night in Rome pondering a difficult decision, indeed pondering all the decisions in her life so far. The reader watches with her and wonders how she will act. And wonders again when she finally does.There are other major shifts in the narrative but none stood out for me quite the way those two did. In fact, Henry James purposely avoids describing the most significant shift of all, skipping a three-year section of Isabel\u2019s life completely - which is a very effective narrative device of course, introducing both surprise and suspense in a story that has only a six-year span in total. As a reader I appreciated both strategies: the emphasis he seemed to place on some scenes and the complete omission he allowed to others. It was all very wonderful. In fact this book has revised my idea of what \u2018wonderful\u2019 means. 'The Portrait of a Lady' is vying for a place as the highlight of my Henry James reading year even though The Ambassadors was already firmly camped in that position. I've decided they can be the joint highlight - they have a lot of wonderfulness in common.When I finished 'The Portrait', I turned to HJ\u2019s 1906 appendix and found a paragraph about his concerns for the reader. He writes that he has purposely piled brick upon brick for our benefit, carefully including the details that will enable us to grasp the totality of his creation. And among those details, he mentions two in particular, keystones in the building of the story as it were. The first is the piano scene I described earlier. He speaks of the rare chemistry of that scene in which Isabel recognizes that a huge change is about to happen in her life. I felt really validated as a reader to have been aware in advance of the significance of what I was about to read, and so I wasn't surprised when his other pivotal scene turned out to be the one where Isabel sits up late into the Roman night, pondering her decisions. This is the sixteenth Henry James book I've read in six months. Perhaps I've learnt something of the way his writer\u2019s mind works!More confirmation of that possibility came when he began to discuss the shape of this novel. He continues to speak in terms of bricks and architecture and proportions, and he says that of all his novels, 'The Portrait' is the best proportioned with the exception of a novel he was to write twenty-two years later: The Ambassadors. Alongside a certain \u2018roundness\u2019 in shape which they share, he finds they also share a kind of supporting beam or rib that runs through them. This rib is made from two minor but key characters, Henrietta Stackpole and Maria Gostrey. Both seem extraneous to each story at first glance yet both are central to the architecture of their particular story. I remember noting that Maria Gostrey was the thread that allowed me to find my way through the labyrinth that was 'The Ambassadors' so it was wonderful to hear Henry James confirm that, and underline the links between the two books as well. I was also reminded that I had begun to look at his books in terms of architecture while reading The Wings of the Dove, so I really appreciated his architectural metaphors.In fact the appendix left me amazed and wondering at every turn. In the updates, I quoted part of a paragraph on his theories about the \u2018house of fiction\u2019. I'd like to quote the whole thing here because it is really worth reading - and it provided me with huge insights into some Gerald Murnane books I've puzzled over in the past, The Plains and Inland, and offered a strong desire to read his Million Windows:The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million - a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbors are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; \u201cfortunately\u201d by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the \u201cchoice of subject\u201d; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the \u201cliterary form\u201d; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his \u201cmoral\u201d reference.\u2026\u2026\u2026This book is the final one in my 2017 Henry James season and I can't think of a better title to finish on. But in every ending there are beginnings - 'The Portrait' has led me to another book: Henry James says he took the slight \u2018personality\u2019, the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl and created what he called \u2018an ado about Isabel Archer\u2019. That reference has prompted me to go back to Shakespeare and read Much Ado About Nothing. I do love when one book leads to another!"], ["Ugh, ech, the elitism that breeds in readers! We think we're such nicey cosy bookworms and wouldn't harm a fly but we seethe, we do. Of course, readers of books just naturally look down on those who don't read at all. In fact they try not to think of those people (nine tenths of the human race I suppose, but a tenth of the human race is still a big number) because it makes them shudder. (How lovely it would be to go riding in a carriage through some dreadful council estate flinging free copies of Ulysses and Mrs Dalloway right and left (although Ulysses might catch some of those urchins a hefty blow on the temple (which might cause a shift in their brain landscape and evoke a sudden craving for modernist novels, like when people are struck by a bus and wake up talking in a French accent, that can happen))). So that's one obvious kind of reader elitism. But then, some readers think that what the majority of readers actually read is appalling (Hungervinciboneskitehelpslappery Twilit Shades of Pottery doo dah). It's not that you read, it's what you read. Of course. And then, amongst those elevated readers, some literary authors are considered greater than some others (why are you wasting your time with William Gaddis when you could be knee-deep in Proust, dwarling? I simply don't understand it). And then, even when you scale the heights and find yourself munching down some Henry James like he was the last well-done steak (with Chateau Lafleur) you were going to get before your solo trek (no huskies) to the south pole, you still get it - oh dwarling, why are you still dillydallying in the Middle Period when you still haven't read The Golden Bowl you naughty Jamesian you!Thus it is that I say - oh no, not The Portrait of a Lady. Too too obvious. Try The Awkward Age or The Ambassadors. Much better."], ["Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady is considered to be one of the first American novels to make full use of social and psychological realism as European authors - such as Flaubert, Balzac and George Eliot - were already practicing in their works. Considered to be his biggest accomplishment along with The Ambassadors, Portrait added Isabel Archer to the company of great fictional heroines - as the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, Becky Sharp and Jane Eyre - and, in a century marked by unsatisfied bourgeois wives and adultery in fiction - Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina come to mind -, it was a breath of fresh air to accompany and delve into James' protagonist's thoughts and inner feelings.Starting with a very slow pace, the narrative contains long and elaborate descriptions. It feels James is painting a richly detailed picture for every scene. As we arrive in Gardencourt - the Touchett's English country estate where our story opens and closes -, we encounter Mr. Touchett, his son Ralph and a family friend called Lord Warburton. Among other things, they discuss how Mrs. Lydia Touchett is in America and will bring along her niece called Isabel Archer to visit Europe.Isabel is a young woman, from Albany, New York, who accepts her aunt's offer to initially stay with her in Gardencourt and then later travel through the continent, eager to explore and be enriched by the places she's never been before and experience life at its fullest. Upon her arrival, we begin to learn what her ideals and plans are, along with her hopes and dreams.Since the beginning, her cousin Ralph seems to have been as curious as we were to see what Isabel would make of her life. In a way, we almost could say Ralph was conducting an experiment: Isabel had an independent mind, she was emotionally and psychologically self-sufficient - didn't seem inclined to get married for the time being, which was different for a girl of her age at the time. She was thirsty for knowledge first and foremost: \u201cI don\u2019t want to begin life by marrying\u201d, Isabel asserts to Ralph. \u201cThere are other things a woman can do.\" But without money, how far could she go with her unattached ways? She was probably bound to eventually getting married. Her cousin, then, arranged it and she became financially independent as well. Certain that he was doing Isabel a good deed, Ralph convinced his father - who was very fond of Isabel - at his deathbed to leave her an impressive amount of money. Now she had all that was necessary to decide her destiny without any barriers or anyone to hold her back. The experiment was on.After traveling for over a year, the now wealthy Isabel Archer is in Florence, where her aunt lives. A friend she greatly admired, Madame Merle - Mrs. Touchett's close friend who Isabel got acquainted with some time after she arrived in Gardencourt - skillfully introduces her to Gilbert Osmond: an American expatriate widower who's lived in Italy for years. Isabel is very impressed with his refinement and intelligence and thinks of him as having a beautiful mind. Despite her family and friends complaints about this relationship, Isabel - after having declined two previous suitors - accepts Osmond's marriage proposal.The story then jumps in time and there's a narrative shift: for a bit, James leaves Isabel and Osmond in the background while he focuses on Pansy Osmond - Osmond's young daughter - and Edward Rosier - Isabel's childhood friend who's in love with Miss Osmond and is trying to get Madame Merle to help him marry his darling girl. Through their story, we still have glimpses of Isabel's life and we learn that she's been now married for two years and that she lost a son who died six months after his birth. Isabel and her husband seems to disagree about everything and we learn she's unhappy.Henry James, who once conducted a very slow paced - almost contemplative - narrative, gradually started to accelerate it, adding drama and a sense of urgency to his words. Right after an unsettling argument with Osmond one evening, Isabel, now feeling more distraught than ever, starts pondering and analyzing the many circumstances she finds herself in. The author immerses us in a deeply personal and intensely psychological account of her thoughts and emotions. Among the things Isabel reflected upon for a long time were the conclusion that her husband must hate her and the realization that Osmond had gained total control of her - the once independent and strong witted woman was now a subjugated spirit; the woman who once seemed to be against doing what was expected of her was now conforming to her husband's decisions. \"When the clock struck four she got up; she was going to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets.\"Complicating things even further is the revelation Countess Gemini - Osmond's sister - makes to Isabel of a long time secret, that leaves her completely shaken. This only comes to deteriorate even more her relationship with Gilbert. Now, fully aware of the situation she was put in through manipulations and schemes, Isabel is faced with a big decision: her cousin Ralph is dying in Gardencourt and her dictatorial husband is completely against her visiting England. Showing the old Isabel may still be somewhere locked inside of herself, she confronts her husband and leaves to be with her cousin.The Portrait of a Lady, through its length, presents a number of opposites, but the most striking ones are the battles between freedom vs. destiny and affection vs. betrayal. In the book's final moments, we witness that Isabel is offered a way to go back to where and to whom she was when she first came to Europe: \"The world's all before us - and the world's very big\", she is told. She could once again explore life and fill herself with hopes - but declined the opportunity: \"The world's very small\", she answered. With a much talked about conclusion that has both fascinated and infuriated - another battle of opposites? - readers, James' ending remains open to a lot of interpretations.It's disturbing to watch an unhappily married woman with an opportunity to leave it all behind - and the means to do it - simply not choosing freedom. Did Osmond finally accomplish to shatter her spirit? Another theory is that maybe marriage was an unbreakable vow and she felt she had a moral duty to her husband. Or was she trying to be protective of Pansy - who was mirroring Isabel's unhappiness and was another example of a woman who seemed to think that she was obliged to follow other's decisions even if it made her unhappy - and determined to stand by her side and not let the same happen to her step daughter? Innumerable possibilities...James has been known for structuring his novels with a series of circles surrounding a center. With that in mind, a hopeful interpretation of the book's ending is that, in order to complete that circle, Isabel must return to her husband, properly end her marriage so she could once again be able to start anew and free her spirit once and for all.Rating: for such an interesting and comprehensive analysis of freedom, human consciousness and ultimately, existentialism: 4 stars."], ["Book Review\n\n3+ out of 5 stars for The Portrait of a Lady, a classic story called the \"Great American Novel,\" written by Henry James in 1881. I adore Henry James and found great enjoyment in his literary works when I began reading him in my freshmen year at college. As an English major, I was exposed to many different authors, but I felt a strong connection with him and this literary period. American realistic works spoke to me above any of the other \"classic\" books I had been reading. As a result, I chose Henry James as the primary focus of an independent study course I'd taken in my senior year. I read 6 or 7 of his books during those 3 months and am going back now to provide quick reviews, as not everyone finds him as enjoyable as I do. I also don't want to bore everyone with a lengthy review on how to interpret him or his books.The Portrait of a Lady tells the story of a young woman who years to have her own life and make her own mark on the world. She doesn't want to be contained by marriage or the structure in place at the time in the late 19th century. She has different characteristics coming from American, English and continental European female archetypes. She has strong moral and ethical values. She knows who she is, yet she does not know all. As she moves through life, she makes choices that are not easy for her to execute. What I loved about this work is its deep exploratory view points, beautiful language and unparalleled characters. Though I only give it a 3, when compared to some of this other works, I would recommend you read a few chapters or sections, just to see if it is something you could find yourself getting lost in.The impact you feel upon reading this book is questioning what is the true view of a lady, how is she different from generation to generate, location to location and societal class to societal class. James knows women. He is very accurate on many levels... wrong on a few, too. But to put out his thoughts, in a huge tome, at a time when women were beginning to get more rights... and be able to cross genres and genders... is amazing. It's less about what he says and more about how he says it. And that's why I enjoy reading him... but even I admit, I can only take 1 book every few years! :)\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Isabel Archer is a young American lady, for whom the novel is titled, who is adventurous and very independent. She turns down two marriage proposals in the 1st half of the book to preserve her independence, one from Casper Goodwood, a young wealthy American, and one from Lord Warburton, a wealthy English aristocrat. When her English uncle dies, she inherits a large sum of money and travels with her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, to her Italian villa where she eventually meets, falls in love with, and marries Gilbert Osmond. All of her family and friends try to dissuade her from this, but to no avail, and she finally learns that Osmond doesn't love her, married her for her money, and to own her as another of his possessions. Obviously there is a lot more intrigue to the story and the enjoyment for me came from the wonderful writing of James."], ["Exquisite, cozy, at times funny, at times sad, and unforgettable. I won\u2019t bore readers with another summary of the story; they\u2019re abundant on this site. I will say that with Isabel Archer, James earns his place in the canon with a proto-feminist (yes, I said it, proto-feminist) novel of a remarkable, if hard to describe heroine, who is faithful to her idea(l)s, rejects the affections of strong (but good) men, and suffers unnecessarily at the hands of a Machiavellian cad and an equally manipulative woman.

Bite the bullet, finish it off keeping as much in mind as you can. I\u2019d also advise reading it on a Kindle (for the built-in dictionary) or, at the very least, keep a dictionary at hand. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have; and if you don\u2019t\u2014if you read the wrong book for you (this one), please, please, don\u2019t say James is an idiot (or some equivalent) or that the book is just boring (or some equivalent)\u2014instead, face the fact, you read the wrong book."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "Once imagined in past centuries as an affliction from the gods and as a majestic woman of power and wisdom, Dame Melancholy, the Blue Lady, has been reduced to a modern, impersonal clinical category.

was nineteen. It was a great way to experience spirituality and romance as a teenager, but as I got older, its lusty descriptions of the true meaning of love, marriage, and life just seem like pretty, but shallow, wordplay.Now, don't write to me and prove me wrong on this, because I like the idea very much. I believe that Khalil Gibran was quite the player.

Born in Lebanon in 1883, his poetry accompanied by artwork has been translated into over twenty languages. I decided to read his opus The Prophet, which is awe inspiring poetry written in novella form. A classic that often surfaces on goodreads classics groups, The Prophet is a worthy edition to one's classics collection. Gibran's philosopher Al-Mustafa has traveled by boat to visit the Orphalese people and speak words of wisdom to them. Almitra becomes especially enamored in Al-Mustafa's teachings and either hangs onto or collaborates with him in his words as he wows the Orphalese with both his wisdom and knowledge. Gibran's words translated into English are like reading any religion's scriptures and flow like the honey of the Middle East. Passages speak of \"a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly\" and \"knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream\" yet each page of this thin volume evokes powerful philosophy. It is of little wonder that Almitra and her people would become enamored with the words of Al-Mustafa. Almitra was also a seeress in her own right and desired that Al-Mustafa remain in Orphal and that they join forces in prophecy. I found this thinking to be progressive for its time or any time. Some of Almitra's forward thinking included: \"Blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken.\" She is keen in her perceptive skills and values having one like Al-Mustafa in her midst. Yet, his destiny is not to remain in one sea faring village but to travel the region preaching words of wisdom to all people. The version I read was a pocket book that also included a few of Gibran's sketches of Al-Mustafa. Between the poetry and drawings, he has created a masterpiece that flowed on the pages. While I am used to reading psalms and prophetic teachings, I did not find Gibran's words to be anything that out of the ordinary but in comparison to the majority of secular works, his words are powerful. Although not my absolute favorite, I am glad that I read this opus and would read more of Gibran's poetry. 3.75 stars rounded to 4."], ["The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran \u0627\u06cc\u0646

Because my French is a work in progress, I read L'Amant de la Chine du Nord (The North China Lover) in short bursts over the summer when I was in the mood, but in the last few days I decided to devote a few hours to it every day, and I don't regret it at all.Reading in other languages really is such a different experience, and that first moment when you go a whole page without looking up a single word is triumphant. Before Duras' work I could ramble about unemployment, politics, immigration, current events, etc., but the concept of love and loss in the language of love and loss had evaded me. Duras changed that.Colonialism in South East Asia is possibly the most complicated version of Western colonialism: the Dutch in Indonesia, the British in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc., and the French in Indochina. None of it ended prettily or cleanly. Even today (especially today), SE Asia is a sometimes unfathomable mix of territory disputes, rebelling ethnic groups, human and drug trafficking, and shipping. In Duras' time of the 1930s, Vietnam was under French rule, and this novel is the story of her affair with an older, opium-addicted Chinese man.Emotions break, tears flow, and anger sparks, the flow of the French creates an emotion of itself. The story flows with these emotions, as does the speed of the text. The atmosphere of Vietnam is so important for Duras, and the events of the novel haunt me and more importantly Duras, positively and negatively. I know I'll always remember why it happened, long after I forget what happened. The flow of the river, the buzz of the rice fields, and lying in a bed for hours, blankly staring, waiting for something to end."], ["Inspired by Richard's commitment to multi-lingual reading and blogging, I've decided to try to work on my languages as well, and read more novels in the original French. How many is \"more\"? Well, last year I read a grand total of one. So, in order to top that, this year I'll need to read...two. Maybe the year after that I'll read three. As you can tell, I'm practically signing up for \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu already. Considering that last year's pick, J.M.G. Le Cl\u00e9zio's \nOurania\n, was something of a struggle for me and took several months to complete, I'm startled to find that I've already finished my first French book of 2010: Marguerite Duras's L'amant de la chine du nord (available in English translation as The North China Lover). Duras's book is actually a re-working of her earlier novel L'amant; it re-envisions the story as a film, and retells it from a more complete, possibly mature angle. Both L'amant and L'amant de la chine du nord are fictionalized memoirs dealing with Duras's sexual coming-of-age as a young - very young - Frenchwoman in 1920s Vietnam (then French Indochina). Well, let me be blunter: it tells the story of her first consummated affair, with a wealthy 28-year-old Chinese man, when she was fourteen.Given that plot there's obviously a lot to talk about here vis-a-vis sexual and gender dynamics, but let's get some formalist stuff out of the way first: Duras's prose is vivid and lush, and the fact that she wrote this novel as if giving screen directions (including camera pans, fade-ins and fade-outs, etc.), makes the reading experience overwhelmingly visual. This kind of narration is often a turn-off for me; I tend to find it choppy or overly mannered. But in Duras's case I think it works perfectly for two reasons. In the first place, this is one of those books in which the setting is almost as much of a character as the characters themselves. The hot monsoon nights, the flooded rice fields, the night sounds of the young Vietnamese night guards singing outside the gates of the main character's colonial boarding school - presenting all this to the audience front-and-center brings it to the foreground, and persuades the reader to concentrate on it, to see it. And secondly, in a film all the viewer knows about a character's motivations is how she sees them acting - she has no direct access to their interior monologue. A cinematic approach, then, plays perfectly into one of Duras's main themes in this novel: the ambiguity of human actions.Because L'amant de la chine du nord does not leave the reader with any clear answers about why the characters act as they do, or how we ought to feel about it. Compared to, say, Lolita, which argues pretty plainly for Humbert as a delusional, dirty old man and Delores Haze as his victim, Duras's moral universe is extremely murky. The main character, known only as \"l'enfant\" (\"the child\"), comes from a desperately poor family of French settlers in Indochina; we later learn that she has already had several offers of marriage/concubinage from men in their thirties, which her mother has pressed her to accept in order to alleviate the family's poverty, but which she has refused. In her boarding school, certain teachers and even students choose to prostitute themselves in the streets. In this light, her meeting with and choice to pursue her wealthy lover (known in the novel as le Chinois or The Chinaman) seems a clear economic decision, the best she can do in a bad situation. But things are not so simple. There's no question that l'enfant lusts after le Chinois - that her psyche is, in fact, super-saturated with lust. She has incestuous thoughts about her younger brother, with whom she is extremely close. She is already involved in a semi-sexual relationship with one of her female school friends, and the two of them fantasize about taking the place of their prostitute teacher - the idea of forbidden sex being thrilling to them. From practically the moment she meets le Chinois, she is fascinated by his physicality - she is the aggressor in their relationship, and it seems as though she is acting from real feeling, not just aping the actions of adults in order to produce a desired effect. At the same time, it's not completely positive for her, or comfortable to read; her experiences of actually having sex, especially at first, involve a lot more pain and suffering than pleasure, and she seems perplexed by the strength of Le Chinois's emotions when he falls in love with her. He is weeping about how his magnate father will disinherit him if he marries her, and she is teasing him and wanting him to tell her more about life in China. Duras does a creepily effectual job at blending L'enfant's precocious sensuality and sexuality with certain other, very kid-like, qualities in her. She kind of just wants to experiment and learn about the world, and also to have sex. Would she want to have sex if it weren't for her family's poverty, and the possibility of getting her hands on some of Le Chinois's money? Would she want to have sex if she hadn't been prematurely sexualized by the men who want to buy her from her mother, and by her feelings for her brother, and by the boarding school atmosphere? One can't help asking these questions, but at the same time they're a bit pointless: if those things had been different, she would have been a completely different person. And here's another thing that's unusual in this type of story: L'enfant and Le Chinois enjoy each others' company. You never get the sense that Lolita and Humbert ever have fun together, but L'enfant and Le Chinois go out late at night to restaurants in the Chinese section of town, tell each other stories, laugh at each others' frankness. To be fair, there is also a lot of crying in the book, and overall it's somewhat melancholic, but unlike Kristin Lavransdatter it also has its fair share of mutual enjoyment of the present moment. And although the affair (inevitably) ends, and everyone feels sad about that for a while, L'enfant doesn't really suffer as a punishment for having sex, in the way that Lolita, Tess Durbyfield, and other literary sexual victims do (dying in childbirth, no less! Talk about sexual punishment). Duras's protagonist goes through a mixed emotional experience and then gets on with her life, but one never gets the sense that she is suffering, or enjoying herself, as a vehicle for the author to make a point about who is right and who is wrong. Duras's book is the most non-judgmental treatment - in either a positive or negative way - of sex between a very young person and an older person, I've ever come across. I wouldn't call it primarily a love story, but neither would I say it's primarily a tale of oppression. (And speaking of oppression: the racial dynamics among the transplanted white French, colonized Vietnamese, and wealthy landowning Chinese are another whole fascinating subject.)The whole tale brings up interesting questions about the triangulation of love, lust, liking, and money. If L'enfant is more or less engaging in sex work, does that mean she doesn't love Le Chinois? Does it mean she doesn't like him? If her first feeling upon seeing him is one of lust, does that invalidate the money motive? To what extent are the desires for money and sex interwoven? And what should we, as readers, be hoping for as we read this story? Duras allows all of these elements to coexist in uneasy harmony, which in itself is an admirable feat."], ["It's been several years since I read this book. I still give it five stars for the reason that it stayed with me. I remember the swirl of emotions it brought up as I turned the pages. The sympathy I had for the young girl, the disgust mingled with strange understanding of her mother. And the empathy and repulsion I felt toward the Lover. Marguerite Duras certainly had a talent for being blunt, for making you accept the controversy of her situation simply as a historical fact. She kept you so wrapped up in her words that the reality of the story didn't sink in until later. A very, very young girl...who should have been playing with her friends and studying...had an affair with a man in his thirties. And was in love with her brother. Revolting. And yet, Duras left me fascinated the whole read through. I was so taken that it took me awhile to reject the subject matter as unacceptable. And so, this book, along with \"The Lover\" left me unsettled. I can't call it anything less than a masterpiece with a \"but\" at the end. One must truly read it and decide for themselves.

The earlier version, much more internalized, focused, concentrated and concise, was a far finer distillate -- dreamy and swoon-inducing throughout -- whereas this version, with its more removed and distant perspective, conventional linear progression, ampler narrative and autobiographical detail, and extended dialogue passages saps the material of its poetic power and essence. This may seem counterintuitive, but truth is not necessarily to be had in piling on more and explicit detail; and I would challenge anyone to do a side-by-side comparison of the two versions to prove my assertions. The earlier version had more heart and replicated the lover/narrator's non-linear internal thought processes which made the reader feel closer to the mind of the storyteller, of the teller's thoughts. I cared and felt when I read that. Not so much with this one.The intrusion into the narrative of what seem to be instructions for filmmakers to follow in the filmed version of the story came off as a tad crass to me, as though I was reading a work of art one minute and a \"property\" the next.One thing I did like about this version is that the child's family is treated more sympathetically, especially compared to the movie version where their pettiness is almost two-dimensional.The question for me is: Which version comes closest to the aching sense of longing, the essence of wistful memory? For me, it is the first version.I really wanted to like this and did, for about a hundred pages, but eventually found myself whittling it down from four stars to three stars to two stars.In essence, I thought this was a case of more is less."], ["You know, I don't even want to give this book 3 stars, but I'm being generous and sticking to my rule (even thought I had to break it with this author not too long ago) of never giving below a 3-star rating, except in extreme cases.Maybe there's something wrong with me or perhaps my tastes have changed, but I used to be SUCH a hardcore fan of hers-truly, a fangirl. Especially of The Lover and this book (even though it's just The Lover with bigger font & more white space). Today, though, it's like I'm taking a cold, hard look at her work-an \"investigation\" triggered by reading Blue Eyes, Black Hair (one of the worst 60 pages I've had to get through in my whole life). Now, I don't want to be a hater (because I had such a love affair with The Lover early on), I might give her another chance. But at the same time I wonder if all her work is erotica (not my choice genre to read), and more importantly, if all her work is erotica between 14 year old girls & 35 year old, grown men. The man she was screwing in book 1 should've been with her mother since they were about the same age, instead of going with her little teeny bopper daughter. Sickening and silly. In hindsight I (the reader) was supposed to be so blown away by him because he was rich, had a nice car, nice clothes, and a decent place to live. So in exchange for all the material things the loser main character didn't have, I'm supposed to turn a blind eye to the fact that every passage I'm reading where he \"ripped her clothes off\", \"couldn't even make it to the bed,\" and so on, is describing sex between a 14 year old child and an adult male.So,I'm more upset with myself for embracing such work, paying for it. I don't want to support that kind of writing. And frankly, I wonder what the author sees in that kind of stuff. But anyway, enough. The review is over and I've talked for far too long on this. Thanks for reading."], ["One of my favorite books, by my favorite writer. I first read Duras when I was 15 and i think, that has made all the difference. Her writing touched me where no other writer has been able to reach till date. The story, the plot, the characters - are all irrelevant in her book. You can't pickle it under fiction or non fiction. No flowery language, no melodrama. Reading her is just an experience, very intense, often tumultuous. This book is about her love affair with the rich North Chinese guy - you could say - but i could never call it a love story or say that it had romance. Impossible to contain her in such lame labels. In fact, each time i've picked up any of her books, i've just ached to pick up the pen and paper and start writing...about what? I don't know. It's just this overwhelming feeling to be with yourself and let the whirlpool inside flow out. Sometimes i'd be able to write and sometimes i'd just return to her book, admitting to myself that she knows best how i feel. Often i've felt my discovering her was not just a random event...she's almost like a planet squaring your moon....affecting your life choices, influencing your destiny, without you being able to crack the code of the scheme of things."], ["I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I heard that it was basically a retelling of the Lover and wasn\u2019t nearly as good. Given all of the negative reviews, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It has quickly become a favorite. I read the Lover about a year ago and saw the film adaptation shortly after. I didn\u2019t think that she could add much to the already rich story, but she really did.The North China Lover is a simple story. It is semi-autobiographical and tells of an affair Duras had as a child with an older Chinese man while living in what is now Vietnam. I found this telling to be much more raw and honest than the Lover, but at the same time was more tender in many places. I love Duras\u2019 writing style. It is the type of writing that is so simple and bare, but sticks with you and resonates.I would definitely recommend this book (but obviously for older audiences)."]], "review_count": "18", "description": "\u00abJ'ai appris qu'il \u00e9tait mort depuis des ann\u00e9es.

It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "0", "description": null, "author": "Mark C. Childs"}, "Behavior in Public Places": {"average_rating": "4.11", "review": [["I read this book about twenty years ago and was reminded of it this morning by another reviewer on Goodreads.On browsing through this now, I had forgotten how interesting this French poet was and I do believe that Henry Miller has done an admirable job here. It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me. I'm off to 'A Season in Hell.'"], ["ONE OF THE BOOKS OF MY LIFE .

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "5", "description": null, "author": "Erving Goffman"}, "Art for Public Places: Critical Essays": {"average_rating": "3.00", "review": [["I read this book about twenty years ago and was reminded of it this morning by another reviewer on Goodreads.On browsing through this now, I had forgotten how interesting this French poet was and I do believe that Henry Miller has done an admirable job here. It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty. Nothing lacks now to complete the concert of hells he once begged for.\"I wasn't sure where my pleasure reading course was pointing this summer, and I think it was just handed to me.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "Information concerning the context of public art projects in the UK, the USA and Eastern Europe is presented in this book.

Maybe I'm not smart enough or deep enough to appreciate a book like Tropic of Cancer, but for me each page was a tedious struggle.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one to carelessly fling aside any book that doesn't capture my attention in the first 100 pages. Once I start a book, it's difficult for me to give it up, mostly because it makes me feel like a quitter; but I found myself getting angry as I grudgingly plodded through this one. I kept thinking, \"Henry, for chrissakes, give me something, ANYTHING to latch onto here!\" That's when I decided it was time to give up.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally. Sorry; the last paragraph today gets cut off a few sentences early!)The CCLaP 100: In which I read for the first time a hundred so-called \"classics,\" then write reports on whether or not they deserve the labelBook #20: Tropic of Cancer, by Henry Miller (1934)The story in a nutshell:Like many of the other novels to first become commercial hits under the moniker of \"Modernism\" (see, for example, past CCLaP-100 title Mrs Dalloway from the same period), Henry Miller's infamously raunchy Tropic of Cancer from 1934 doesn't bother to concern itself much with traditional plot or a traditional three-act structure, but is rather an attempt to capture the details of a particular moment in history in as intense a way as possible, using not only humorous anecdotal tales but also the brand-new literary technique known as \"stream of consciousness.\" And man, what a period of history to capture -- based on Miller's own experiences from half a decade before, the novel is set in Paris in the years after World War One, a time when most young people had turned permanently cynical and nihilistic, horrified as they rightly were over what exact carnage humans had proven themselves capable of, now that humans had added mechanized industry (trains, machine guns, biological weapons) to the business of war. Add to this that the US itself had still not established its own global-class artistic community (which wouldn't happen until New York's Greenwich Village after World War Two), and you're left with the situation Miller describes with such black humor here -- of entire Parisian neighborhoods become boisterous, drunken melting pots, packed to the gills with bohemians from around the world who no longer give a crap about anything, who embrace such things as casual sex and exotic drugs in a way no other generation had embraced them before, as they party their way to the apocalypse they were all sure was right around the corner. Multiply by 300 pages, and you basically have Miller's book.The argument for it being a classic:There are two basic arguments over why Tropic of Cancer should be considered a classic, starting with the book itself: It is, after all, a shining example of early Modernism, the exact kind of radical departure from the flowery Victorian style that so many young artists were embracing back then, here done in a mature and self-assured way that builds on the literary experiments of the previous twenty years, but that finally makes it palatable for the first time to the general reading audience (and by \"palatable\" I mean \"not incomprehensible,\" thank you very MUCH James Freaking Joyce). As such, its fans say, the novel should be rightly celebrated for the literary masterpiece it is; one of those rare books that gets stream-of-consciousness exactly right, one of those rare books that perfectly shows the combination of arrogance and self-hatred that mixes in the warm dysfunctional heart of any true bohemian. Ah, but see, in this case there's an entirely different second reason why this should be considered a classic; because for those who don't know, thirty years after its initial publication in Europe, this was one of the landmark artistic projects of the 1960s to help finally lift the yoke of government censorship in America, one of the first projects used by the courts to help define was exactly is and isn't \"obscene,\" adding immense fuel to the countercultural fire that was going on in this country at the same time. If it wasn't for Tropic of Cancer, fans say, we would still have the all-or-nothing paradigm of the Hays Code in the arts, instead of the \"put out what you want and we'll give it a rating\" paradigm of our present day; no matter what you think of the book itself, they argue, this alone is a reason to consider it a classic.The argument against:Like many of the titles in the CCLaP 100 series (see The Catcher in the Rye, for example), the main argument against Tropic of Cancer seems to be the \"What Hath God Wrought\" one; that is, the book itself may not be that bad, but it legitimized something that should've never been legitimized, in this case whiny confessional stream-of-consciousness rants from broke artists in their twenties living in big cities, complaining for 300 pages about how unfair life is and how all the prostitutes keep falling in love with them. Yep, it was Tropic of Cancer that started all that, critics claim; and anytime you come across yet another sad little blog about how the heart of the city beats in the weary soul of some overeducated, entitled slacker, that's one more time we should visit the grave of Miller and pee all over it, in retribution for him creating a situation where such blogs are encouraged in the first place. Again, it's not so much that people complain about the book being awful on its own (although some will definitely argue that stream-of-consciousness has always been a house of cards, difficult to make work well within a literary project); it's more that the book simply isn't great, and should've never gotten the accolades and attention it did, with Miller being damn lucky that he had as exciting a sex life as he did at the exact moment in history that he did, along with the shamelessness to write it all down.My verdict:So as will very rarely be the case here at the CCLaP 100, let me admit that this is one of the few books of the series I've actually read before; in fact, much more than that, it was one of the books I practically worshipped in my early twenties as a snotty, overeducated, oversexed artist myself, a book that had a bigger impact on both my artistic career and just how I lived my life in general back then than probably any other single project you could mention. So needless to say I was a bit biased going into this week's essay; I not only consider Tropic of Cancer a classic, but easily among the top-10 of all the books in this series, one of those books that any restless young person of any generation should immediately gravitate towards starting around their 18th or 19th birthday. And that's because Miller is so good here, so damn good, at perfectly capturing that restlessness that comes with any generation of young, dissatisfied creatives -- that sense that they want to do something important, that they should be doing something important, just that none of them know how to do that important thing, so instead let that passion seep out through their sex lives, their clothing choices, the bands they listen to, etc. Tropic of Cancer is all about yearning, all about grasping life to the fullest you possibly can, not for the sake of simply doing so but rather because this is the only way you'll ever find what you're truly seeking. Or as MIller himself puts it: \"I can't get it out of my mind what a discrepancy there is between ideas and living.\"But that all said, let me just plainly warn you -- whoo man, is this a filthy book, with it unbelievably enough still just as able to shock and offend as when it first came out. And again, I see this as an asset and strength of Miller as an author; because ultimately it's not really the language itself that has gotten people so upset about this book over the decades (you'll hear worse in most Hollywood hard-R sex comedies), but rather that Miller embraces a prurient attitude throughout, one that plainly addresses the cold realities about sex which are not usually discussed in polite company. Just take, for example, the chapter where he compares for the reader the various young artsy prostitutes who live in his neighborhood; of how the best ones are the ones who have come to grips with the fact that they're whores and not wives or girlfriends, and therefore lustily embrace the exact disgusting acts that wives and girlfriends won't, the main reason men visit prostitutes in the first place. Yeah, not for delicate sensibilities, this one is; despite it being almost 75 years old now, you should still exercise caution before jumping into it feet-first.And then finally, re-reading it this week for the first time since college two decades ago, I've realized something else about this book; that it's not just the fun little stories of crazy sex and urban living that Miller gets right, but also the more somber reflections of perpetual poverty, of the almost existential dread that can develop when waking up in the morning and not knowing how you're going to eat that day. This is the flip-side of the crazy bohemian life, something plainly there in Tropic of Cancer but that most people don't see when first reading it, or when reading it at a young age; that to live a life rejecting middle-class conformity and embracing chaos is not just endless evenings of absinthe and oral sex, that there's a very real price to pay for rejecting all these things as well, the price of health and kids and normal relationships and any kind of slow building one could potentially do in their chosen career. Let's not ever forget that the things Miller talks about in Tropic of Cancer happened half a decade before his literary career ever really took off, years where basically none of them got anything accomplished at all except to definitively list all the kinds of books they didn't want to write; let's also never forget that Miller's life got dramatically more boring after his literary career took off, busy as he suddenly was with...you know, writing all those books.

In contrast, Orwell\u2019s Miller doesn\u2019t want to leave the whale. God\u2019s punishment ironically is Miller\u2019s safe and comfortable oasis.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "Exploring locales such as city streets, bus stops, parking lots, bars, retail establishments, and discussion groups, <i>Together Alone </i>ventures into what is often thought of as the realm of passing strangers to examine the nature of personal relationships conducted in public spaces. While most studies of social interaction have gone behind closed doors to focus on relationships in the family, school, and workplace, this innovative collection pushes the boundaries of the field by analyzing both fleeting and anchored relationships in the seldom-studied communal areas where much of contemporary life takes place. The contributors shed light on the diversity and character of day-to-day negotiations in public spaces and at the same time illuminate how these social ties paradoxically blend aspects of durability and brevity, of emotional closeness and distance, of being together and alone.", "author": "Calvin Morrill"}, "Miami Blues": {"average_rating": "3.97", "review": [["Treasure of the Rubbermaids 10: Good Cop - Bad CopThe on-going discoveries of priceless books and comics found in a stack of Rubbermaid containers previously stored and forgotten at my parent\u2019s house and untouched for almost 20 years. Thanks to my father dumping them back on me, I now spend my spare time unearthing lost treasures from their plastic depths. Junior Frenger has just gotten out of prison in California, and he promptly heads to Miami with a pocket full of stolen cash and credit cards. No sooner does he arrive at the airport than a Hare Krishna annoys him so Junior breaks his finger before leaving to embark on a one-man crime wave. Freakishly, the Krishna dies from the shock of the broken digit, and homicide detective Hoke Mosley gets the case. Junior goes on to meet part-time call girl Susan, and then unlikely coincidence brings Hoke into contact with both of them. Hoke doesn\u2019t realize that Junior is the guy who inadvertently killed the Krishna, but he picks up on Junior being an ex-con and starts nosing around him and Susan. This annoys Junior who goes on the offensive and ends up in a position to impersonate a police officer while complicating Hoke\u2019s life.This is a slick and original crime thriller with off-beat characters. Junior is described as a \u2018blithe psychopath\u2018, and he lives up to that billing. Since he\u2019s sure that he\u2019ll end up in jail eventually no matter what he does, Junior is only interested in instant gratification and fast cash with no real concern about long term consequences. Susan is so grateful to have someone to take care of her that she quickly begins complying with Junior\u2019s instructions.Hoke isn\u2019t your typical hero cop, either. Just over 40 with a failed marriage and a mouthful of false teeth as well as a taste for bourbon, Hoke\u2018s personal life is a mess. With every spare dime going towards alimony and child support, he has to live in a shabby hotel and can\u2019t even keep up with his bar tab. Hoke\u2019s also losing most of his friends on the police force as an increasingly dangerous Miami of the late \u201880s is causing most of them to flee to safer jobs. Anyone looking for an fast paced crime novel with a dark sense of humor would enjoy this book. The movie version from 1990 with Alec Baldwin and Fred Ward is a good adaptation of this also."], ["With Miami Blues, veteran crime fiction writer Charles Willeford introduces Miami Homicide detective Hoke Moseley who has to rank as one of the most unique and interesting fictional homicide cops ever to work a case. He's middle-aged, divorced, poverty-stricken (because of the divorce) and living in a crappy hotel room. He's not particularly attractive and has little luck with women. (Did I mention that he wears dentures which he seems to be losing all too often?) Still, for all that, he's a very sympathetic character and you can't help rooting for the guy.As the book opens, an ex-con named Junior Frenger arrives at Miami International. Junior is a psychopath with big ambitions and as he's walking through the airport, he accidentally kills a Hare Krishna who has annoyed him. Junior steals some luggage, checks into a hotel and makes a date with a hooker. The hooker turns out to be a fairly spacey community college student named Suzie Waggoner who immediately falls for Junior's line of B.S. and moves in with him.Hoke Moseley is assigned the murder case and manages to track down Suzie and Junior whom he suspects of the crime. Proving it will be another matter altogether, and the dynamics among the three principal characters are very interesting and entertaining.This is an off-beat crime novel with moments both serious and hilariously funny, and fans of crime fiction who haven't yet discovered Willeford might want to search out this book. Fortunately, the entire Hoke Moseley series has recently been released in brand-new editions which are easy to find.As a final note, an excellent movie was made from this novel, starring Alec Baldwin as Junior and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Suzie. Fred Ward plays Hoke and is perfectly cast in the role. This is one of those rare cases when the movie really does do justice to the book."], ["Miami Blues is a bacon-decked, cheese-drenched, all-beef burger with a side of crisp, greasy, cayenne-peppered fries and a combo-size (Xtra-large) plastic cup full of more whiskey than cola. In other words it's an off-beat, breezy crime novel that I swallowed more than chewed over the course of one evening of reading and drinking alone. One star is a burp, the next a congratulatory pat on my tummy, then a satisfied knick at my teeth with a toothpick, and the fourth the pleasant surprise of a few patches of cheese stuck to the empty burger wrapper, which I enthusiastically pried free with tongue and tooth. A charming psychopath and his ditzy babe, casually corrupt and begrudgingly decent cops; meandering conversations built upon cool, punchy dialogue; a few unexpected scenes of brutal violence; gallows humor and false teeth: what more is there for me to say in this review?For dessert: vinegar pie."], ["I just want to go back to Okeechobee. All I\u2019ve had is trouble of some kind or other ever since I came down here. What I\u2019d say, if you asked me about Miami, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a good place for a single girl to be.Susan Waggoner has reasons aplenty to complain. She\u2019s barely in her twenties, and she\u2019s already a runaway from her small town in the Glades, has been abused by her own brother, had an abortion followed by a budding career in prostitution. And that\u2019s all before she gets caught in a deadly game between Miami Police Sergeant Hoke Moseley and a ruthless criminal just landed from California: Frederick J Frenger, who prefered to be called Junior instead of Freddy, was twenty-eight years old. He looked older because his life had been a hard one; the lines at the corners of his mouth seemed too deep for a man in his late twenties. His eyes were a dark shade of blue, and his untrimmed blond eyebrows were almost white. His nose had been broken and reset poorly, but some women considered him attractive. His skin was unblemished and deeply tanned from long afternoons spent in the yard at San Quentin. At five-nine, he should have had a slighter build, but prolonged sessions with weights, pumping iron in the yard, as well as playing handball, had built up his chest, shoulders, and arms to almost grotesque proportions. He had developed his stomach muscles to the point that he could stand, arms akimbo, and roll them in waves. I have chosen this long passage for two reasons : first, the novel spends much more time inside the insane head of Freddy than in the company of Hoke Moseley (this is not a spoiler, and no mystery actually, since we are following the events as they develop and not investigating them after the murder); and secondly, I really like the style of presentation, hard edged but with the occasional flash of black humour, eminently readable (that\u2019s why the term page turner was invented). Willeford knows best how to fade in the background and let his characters determine the dialogue and the style of presentation.Freddy is also the reason I didn\u2019t add the final star to my review: he is well constructed, for a psychopat, but I disliked him intensely right from the start, with his casual atitude towards violence and total disregard for other people\u2019s property. He feels entitled to grab everything he can, seeing himself as a wolf among sheep. He is completely self-absorbed and ready to use his new girlfriend (Susan) both as a sex toy (\u201cplatonic marriage\u201d means something else than what I learned in school for Freddy) and as his criminal accomplice. \u201cYou use that word a lot.\u201d\u201cWhat word?\u201d\u201c \u2018Fair\u2019. Now that you\u2019re twenty years old \u2013 \u201c\u201cOnly by one month \u2013 \u201c\u201c- you\u2019d better forget about things like \u2018fair\u2019 and \u2018unfair\u2019. Even when people talk about the weather, \u2018fair\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d In the opposite corner sits Hoke Moseley, an experienced criminal investigator cut from the same cloth as the classic hard-boiled gumshoes: divorced, alcoholic, cynical, heavy fisted. He\u2019s got the blues big time, justifying the title of this first installment in the series dedicated to him. Any way he looked at it, it was a rotten business.  may refer both to the current affair and to his life in general, who is not satisfied to kick him in the teeth, but goes on to stamp on them, throw them out windows and steal them ( it\u2019s a sort of running joke in the book with his false dentures)The third main actor in the drama is the city of Miami, called in one of the opening scenes \u201cthe original Sin City\u201d, where shop owners are not satisfied with safe boxes and secure windows,(view spoiler)[ but keep a gunman handy in the back room (hide spoiler)], pimps and drug dealers rule the streets and the police feel naked without their guns. Hoke exclaims at one point: It really feels funny as hell driving and walking around Miami without a weapon. By the end, there is too thin a line between the cops and the robbers, with Freddy getting in trouble for finally trying to help a shop owner, and Hoke turning vigilante in his quest to catch up and exact revenge on him. And this amalgam of dark grey tones instead of black and white sharp contrast is probably one more reason why the novel stands above the usual fare in crime thrillers. My last quote is a bitter reminder that the people we trust to keep order and peace are much to often ready to tamper with the evidence in order to \u2018help\u2019 a colleague in trouble: You\u2019re in some jurisdictional trouble if you don\u2019t get your story straight. And here\u2019s the way you tell it, and this is the way we\u2019ll write it up... I am planning to read more from Charles Willeford, hoping he is as skillful in his prose and convincing in his characters as in here."], ["Check out the movie trailer and review @http://more2read.com/review/miami-blues-hoke-moseley-1-by-charles-willeford/This story is reminiscent of the novel the killer inside me by Jim Thompson, in that it features an anti-hero Freddy Frenger jr AkA Ramon Mendez a mean psychopath who is a compulsive liar and thief similar to Thompsons creation of Sheriff Lou Ford. You'd love to have these two mean specimens on the same page. The whole story plays out into one brutal and bloody series of events taking place in the sunshine state of Miami.Freddy teams up with a naive young woman and makes her believe he wants to be married and have a family.While he tries to play family man he's running around town robbing and killing and she's quite oblivious to this dark side. Time will tell though and she will soon taste the end of his whip and as some dark harrowing truths come to light she have to do some mighty quick intelligent thinking.You are put through the eyes of Freddy more than the first appearance of homicide detective Hoke Moseley.Hoke can be brutal when needed but looks to be an interesting detective to read more of in the other novels where Charles Willeford features him as a main protagonist.The dialogue and writing is sharp, the story cuts to the chase there is some deadpan dark humour in the mix and all these blends of style provides entertaining reading through one dark side of Miami with ex-con Freddy 'Junior.'\"Perhaps Freddy has been too pessimistic about his life. He had figured, for as long as he could remember, that someday he would end up in prison for life, wandering around the yard as an old lag, muttering into a white beard and sniping cigarette butts.But that didn't have to be - not if he could plan and execute one big job. Just one big haul...But nothing came to him. He had no concrete ideas except for germ, and the germ was that he had Sergeant Hoke Moseley's badge and ID. The badge was an automatic pass to free food and public transportation; it could also be used to bluff someone out of considerable sum of cash. But who?\""], ["Charles Willeford's Hoke Moseley series starts off with a bang, it's a strange and twisted and outrageously funny at times bang too. His protagonist is a strange beast of a detective with all kinds of odd quirks and is a supporting character to the newly released criminal who spends the entire novel compulsively lying and cheating and making some of the craziest decisions you might expect to find in an Elmore Leonard criminal farce.Willeford packs out the cast with some wonderfully drawn characters who feel completely authentic to the time and place (whether they are or not I will obviously never know having not lived in Miami in the early 80s) and despite the existential nature of the two leads the supporting cast are used to great comic effect. My personal favourite being the jaded college tutor who abuses his pathetic students to their face and readily admits to preparing for his lectures in a nearby bar.With Miami Blues I have discovered has a unique voice in the noir field, different even to Willeford's earlier pulp novels, from the first page he had me grinning and despite some lag in pacing towards the middle this is clearly the work of an author with a lifetime of experience under his belt."], ["After landing in Miami, Freddy Frenger Jr. (or Junior as he prefers to be called) steals three wallets and begins to plan his new life. While leaving the airport he snatches a suitcase and leaves a corpse of a Hare Krishna behind. Detective Hoke Moseley is on the case; chasing Junior and his new hooker girlfriend through luxury hotels and the suburban streets of Miami.If this sounds really familiar then you\u2019ve probably seen the 1990 movie of the same name starring Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh. While there are some major differences to the two, the majority of the book is exactly the same. I\u2019m a little disappointed when I found out this was the first in the Hoke Moseley series, because I always thought of the detective as a supporting role. In the movie Junior steals Moseley\u2019s badge and starts pretending to be a cop to con people; this was the best part of the movie. Sadly in the book there isn\u2019t much of that going on.Charlies Williford is an author of fiction, poetry, an autobiography, and literary criticism but he is best known for his hard-boiled writing. I think it is weird that he was a poet and literary critic as well as pulp writer, but then again I really shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s just an interesting fact about the author. When you think 1980\u2019s hard-boiled novels, Miami Blues is probably going to be one of the top nominations on that list. Charlies Williford was such a prolific writer, with over forty novels published, it is kind of sad that he is best known for the Hoke Moseley series that he wrote very late in his life. I wonder what some of his other books were like, there seems to be a whole lot of hard-boiled novels in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s that look interesting.This book is an example of the noir sub-genre Florida glare which is basically a crime novel set in Florida where the heat and the culture play a role in the story as well. Noir is typically associated to LA and there have been some writers out there that wanted to depict Florida as the perfect location for crime stories as well. Some examples of this include the Travis McGee (by John D. MacDonald), Jack Ryan (by Elmore Leonard), and Dexter Morgan (by Jeff Lindsay) series and I\u2019m sure many more. It is an interesting concept though do we really need another genre? I like how the heat of Florida plays a part in the book and the environment is almost like a supporting character.This was a quick read and one of the rare cases where I think I prefer the movie over the book. I wonder if there are any more noir novels where a character pretends to be a cop in order to con people; I\u2019m sure there are plenty out there, I like the concept and would like to read more of them. I think I\u2019ll have to try another Charlies Williford, maybe something earlier. Does anyone want to recommend me a good Charlies Williford novel?This review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/..."], ["This book by Charles Willeford (along with The Friends of Eddie Coyle by George V. Higgins) is the basis of the great crime fiction of Elmore Leonard. He was heavily influenced by these two authors and it shows. This is not to say that Leonard copied the style \u2013 instead he has improved upon the approach to writing that these authors have themselves mastered.In Miami Blues, the reader spends just as much time with the bad guy as the good guy (maybe even more time..) and he seems like a real person, not just a criminal to be arrested by the police. We spend time with this antagonist, Freddy the psychopathic ex-con, and learn about his motivations, his likes, dislikes, worries, etc. You\u2019ll see the roots of Leonard when you read this book.The \u201cgood guy\u201d cop Hoke a unique denture-wearing guy who is sympathetic yet slightly stand-offish. You don\u2019t learn to love him but you like him as well as feel bad for him. He\u2019s not overly macho and therefore he seems all the more real for that.Some of the language and references are dated and there some racist/homophobic/sexist language that may turn off some readers. However, that language is put there to show the attitudes of people you\u2019d meet everyday. It\u2019s a frank and honest portrayal of real people. The plot relies on a far-fetched coincidence but it\u2019s not too distracting. There\u2019s some pretty brutal scenes in here, too, so fans of violent crime fiction will love it. Even though the roots of Elmore Leonard lie in the fiction of Willeford and Higgins, I think Leonard has improved upon that style, tightening up the writing and making it more laid-back (and more fast-paced, if that makes sense). There is also some humor in Miami Blues, some of it quite funny (the \u201cCrisco\u201d part is pretty hilarious). So, if you like good crime fiction that isn\u2019t a \u201cwhodunit\u201d, read this book. If you like Elmore Leonard, read this book. And for Tarantino fans, QT has also name-dropped Willeford as an influence so if that gets you excited, read this book."], ["Note sure I appreciate a vicious psychopath carrying the name Freddy, but he does and, as the girl he never got around to killing notes \"He does have his good points.\" Book is an interesting time warp, seeing Miami in the 80s with reference on one page to Woolworths, Burdines, and Eckerd Drugs which no longer grace the Florida retail scene, constant smoking anywhere and everywhere by most of the characters, police officers needing to borrow a phone on scene to report in, etc. The story is interesting, if unusual. Short and not so sweet with a most unusual \"hero\", a cop living in a broken down flophouse style hotel, deeply in debt due to a divorce and unable to make much headway as the daughters need braces, and he needing to get his dentures replaced,etc. (Note those dentures play an interesting role in the narrative.) Not sure why the author needed to keep mentioning prices unless it was to tie it to the time period. Still, one of my more interesting reads lately."], ["Well written & an entertaining read. Just not AMAZING!I'll likely read the other 4 books in this series, but I'm in no hurry to do so.

We are not talking about great literature here, nor should anyone expect it. After all, the book isn't written. It is spoken. But that adds to the charm.As these two spoiled boys travel around the world from London to New York, cutting through places like Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia, it is the chattiness and comradeship of such close friends living a \"Boys' Own\" adventure that sucks us in. Whether they are shitting their pants when a Russian miner comes down the stairs with an AK-47 on his hip or they are overwhelmed with emotion when they spend time with Mongolian kids in the sewers of Ulan Bataar, whether they are arguing over the killing of a Grizzly Bear along the Road of Bones or they are worrying for Ewan's life after a car crash near Calgary, they are really just two real blokes enjoying a lark.But they do it all with humility, which suppressed my usual annoyance at rich folk whining about supposed adversity while doing something the rest of us never will. Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman actually seemed to get the immensity of what they were doing (and how insanely lucky they were to be doing it), and even though they complained about the rough roads and the cold and the wet and the adversity, they really learned some important lessons during their trip -- particularly when it came to the importance of their families.As for me, well, I was surprised to discover that I was inspired by Ewan and Charlie to make a journey of my own. It hasn't happened yet, but it will.

The book is comprised of Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman\u2019s daily diary entries that were written during the entire trip. By sharing both of their personal diaries you are able to get two very different perspectives of their overwhelming trip around the world.In the beginning, I was a little irritated, especially with Ewan. He liked to name-drop quite a bit and, also, liked to mention which movies he was filming at the time. However, as I kept reading, I realized that Ewan\u2019s journey was about leaving the film industry behind and discover new things about himself. I thought it was amazing how he and Charley were able to get on a pair of huge BMW bikes without an entourage and travel across some of the most difficult and dangerous roads in the world. They would stay with complete strangers and found out the true meaning of hospitality. For Ewan and Charley, Mongolia was the highlight of their journey. They were able to, finally, leave behind their insecurities and obsessions of keeping their riding schedules. They started to absorb and enjoy the ride. At one part, they decided to take a quick dip in a nearby river.Ewan: \u201cThis is so liberating!\u201d I screamed, running naked along the riverbank back to my bike. \u201cThree nude men in the countryside. We should have some drums and bows and arrows.\u201d The best part of the impromptu skinny-dip was that we had shaken off our obsession with keeping to the schedule\u2026But we\u2019d come to realize that keeping to planned mileage was pointless if we didn\u2019t experience anything along the way.\u201dIt was moments like that that made the book so entertainment; watching grown men run around like little boys enjoying their adventure.However, there were times where the extreme demand on their minds and bodies was just too much. Charley wrote that \u201cIt was just so hard. More than once I thought: what the f\u2014k am I doing here? Why am I doing this? Who thought this was a good idea? I just wanted to go home. For the first time, I really hit a low, my mood all the worse for not having eaten since breakfast.\u201d When Charley would really let himself experience the land, he would lift himself out of his dark mood and journey on. Their extreme mood swings was prevalent throughout their journey. They had highs and lows. It really is amazing how they were able to fight through their emotions to meet their goal.

The A-List actor and a well-to-do buddy (d-list actor?) have a dream and try to put it into action. Some of their challenges are ones that most people would not have - e.g. having a director who does not want you riding a motorcycle to practice for the trip in case you injure yourself before your movie is complete. Some of the other challenges they thought were unique to their \"star power\" were likely challenges that anyone travelling the road less travelled would have: i.e people coming out to stare, insisting on some celebration or having a political leader want to meet you. I have travelled some and am not famous for anything and I have had these experiences.There is lots of whining and the book is not particularly well written. Having said that, these guys are not famous (or almost famous) for their writing skills. Also, they have obviously not had to endure manhy hardships throughout their lives but I wish the editor had reeled them in a bit.One of the areas that I thought was really lacking in their writing was their insistance that the adventure really moved them, that they felt connected to teh places that they had visited and that it changed their lives. Unfortunately, they could not demonstrate this and had to rely on telling us that. I actually believe them but wish I could have read the book and felt it with them.Not the worst book out there and if you are a motorcycle kind of person you will get a lot more out of the many pages devoted to their research and decision making (and errors)that went into motorcycle choice."], ["Wow...

I'm a fan of both actors but I've never seen the TV show so I went into this with a fresh mind not really knowing what to expect. And can I say it was the biggest disappointment.Both authors moaned, whined and cried their way around the globe. I know it must be hard to miss those you live with constantly, but they were crying when they left and cried during a lot of the journey. When they weren't crying they were moaning about the conditions of the road, which they should have expected and each other. On top of that it was hard to tell which of them were narrating. Their writing styles were very similar and when events happened they were brushed under the carpet. Nothing was explained in much detail. In fact more time was spent complaining about the state of the roads.In Ewan McGregor's sections he would constantly 'film drop' mentioning what he'd been in as well as any encounter when someone recognised him from a film. Although I like him as an actor, I didn't really care about that in this context and when he started worrying about his career I skipped large chunks of text. There were a few bits I enjoyed when there was a lot of tension, or funny moments, which it should have been for the majority of the book in my opinion, which is why I'm giving it two instead of one.

There are pieces of it that I did like, such as the instances of interacting with Ukrainians and Mongolians. Those pieces, approximately 20% of the book, are lost in constant whining about the authors' disagreements with each other and their support crew members, not having enough privacy from media, missing their families, and generally what was going on inside their own heads. The authors show some writing talent and a stern editor who could have forced them to focus other than on themselves might have made this a worthwhile read. That's as kind as I can be.

McGregor was already quite a famous actor, appearing in Star Wars, Trainspotting and Big Fish; Boorman was considerably less well-known, in the shadow of both Ewan and his more famous father John Boorman (the director of Deliverance). Long Way Round turned out to be the largest success story of both their careers.I'd already greatly enjoyed the TV series, and since I have motorbikes on the brain at the moment, I recently rewatched it and then picked up the book, which is ostensibly written by both of them but is actually obviously ghostwritten. The style is a bit strange, actually - it regularly cuts between Charley and Ewan, prefacing their segments with their names, but there is no difference whatsoever in their writing style (because, of course, they didn't really write it) and the only way I could ever remember who was talking was to see whether it was \"Charley and I\" or \"Ewan and I\" doing something. I'm really not sure why they chose that style.The book is related in a fairly conversational tone, as though the two adventurers are telling you stories at the pub, and the chronology jumps around quite a bit in the early stages, with flashbacks to the planning sections while they're already riding through Europe. It's a very easy and quick read, and one which I found very enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it to somebody who hadn't already watched the TV series.For somebody who has watched the TV series, however, it's a fascinating in-depth look at the journey. There were a lot of things which happened to them that weren't featured in the series simply because they didn't catch them on film and therefore couldn't work them into the narrative; my favourite would have to be Charley pulling two people out of a car crash on the Road of Bones. There's a deeper insight into their relationship with their two producers, Russ and David, including a crucial confrontation in Prague; there's also a deeper insight into the two men themselves. Both Ewan and Charley are extremely honest about what they think about themselves and each other: their flaws, their strengths, the things they do that really piss each other off... and the fact that, at the end of the day, their positives outweigh their negatives and they're still best friends. There's also appendices detailing the exact mileage and destinations they covered on every day off the trip, and a full inventory of all the equipment they carried on the bikes and in the support vehicles.Overall, Long Way Round is an excellent supplement to its televised brother, but probably wouldn't work as a stand-alone book."]], "review_count": "47", "description": "It started as a daydream.

Or you want to go to a nearby mall and sit in the comfort of a dark movie house. Probably sleep to rest for a couple of hours if the movie turns out to be boring.But you decide to go as you planned at the start of the day. Your gym bag is in your car. You drag your heavy feet to the parking lot. To the gym. You know you have to do it your friend has been telling you that Henry James is good but you imagine the taste of cold beer quenching your thirst or the soft seat inside the theater or the pretty songbird wearing a plunging neckline or showing her slim smooth legs there are quick reads waiting for you like Ray Bradbury\u2019s Farenheit 451 or that Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes. But you know your body needs exercise. You are becoming fatter, heavier and your waistline is expanding. You resisted the quick but empty lure of beer or sleep at the movie house.

The ability to choose, even if it\u2019s a bad choice? Is she a projection of James\u2019s latent homosexuality? Is she a feminist or not? There are no simple answers. 2. The Prose and Psychological ComplexityDamn, James knew how to write long, luxuriant sentences that dig deep into his characters\u2019 minds. Sometimes the effect can be claustrophobic \u2013 get me out of this person\u2019s head! \u2013 but more often it\u2019s utterly compelling and convincing. We partly read fiction to learn about other people\u2019s lives, right? Well, James does that. (The exceptions: Isabel\u2019s two wealthy, handsome suitors, Warburton and Goodwood, are less than believable, and remind me of eager (or horny?) dogs, their tails wagging whenever they\u2019re around their love/lust object.)3. The StoryOkay, not much really happens. But as the book progressed, even though I sort of knew the outcome (it\u2019s hard to avoid spoilers from a 135-year-old classic), I was increasingly curious to see how Isabel would act. In fact, I raced through the final chapters, breathlessly. Who knew: Henry James, page-turner! And have a theory about that ending? Take your turn...4. The HumourIt\u2019s not a comedy, but there are lots of amusing bits. James\u2019s narrator is genial and funny. Henrietta Stackpole, her gentleman friend, Mr. Bantling, and even Gilbert Osmond\u2019s sister, the Countess Gemini, are all very colourful characters who elicit a chuckle or two. And Isabel\u2019s aunt can be terribly cutting as well. I love Ralph (Isabel's cousin) and the dignified British Lord Warburton\u2019s reactions to the enterprising, no-fuss American \u201clady journalist\u201d Henrietta. 5. The SettingsEach one is significant: from the stately Gardencourt, home of Isabel\u2019s relatives the Touchetts, to the bustle and anonymity of London, to the ruins of Rome, where Isabel finds herself stuck in a dead, fossilized marriage. James is a master at finding the right place to stage a scene. I could write an essay about interiors and exteriors in the book, but I\u2019ll spare you.6. The VillainsMadame Merle and Gilbert Osmond: individually they\u2019re sinister, but together they\u2019re positively Machiavellian. In fact, in one scene, it\u2019s revealed that they both like Machiavelli, and Isabel doesn\u2019t get the clue! They totally play her. And yet they\u2019re believable, too. Osmond\u2019s scene in which he professes his love is brilliant in its manipulation; and the final turn of the screw (asking her to do him a favour!) is very clever. Madame Merle\u2019s motivations always keep you guessing. Does she see herself in Isabel? Is she jealous? Does she just want to exert her power over her? The scene in which Isabel sees both in her home, conspiring (evident from their attitudes) is so powerful James refers to it a couple of times. And of course, it\u2019s missing from the Jane Campion film (see below).7. The ThemesDoes money corrupt? What do you really know about someone before you marry? What is the true nature of freedom? What happens when New World (American) \"innocence\" meets Old World (European) \"experience\"? All these themes \u2013 and many others \u2013 come across naturally, and never feel shoe-horned into the story.8. The TechniqueI remember hearing people go on about the architecture of Henry James\u2019s novels, and this one is sturdily, handsomely built. The book begins and ends in the same setting. And there are some ingenious sections in the middle, where time has passed and the reader discovers major information through conversations. Like any great writer, James knows what to leave out. He makes you do work to fill in the pieces, but the novel becomes more memorable because of that. And he bridges the Victorian and Modern eras, in the same way that Beethoven bridges the Classical and Romantic eras.9. Chapter 42After a huge blowup with Osmond, Isabel stays up all night, staring into the fireplace, and ponders her life, thinking: \"How did I get here?\" James considered it one of the best things he\u2019d ever written, and although I haven\u2019t read a lot of his work (which I will soon remedy), I\u2019d have to agree. It\u2019s right up there with Hamlet\u2019s soliloquies.10. The Fact that the Book Doesn't Lend Itself Well To Adaptation A couple days after finishing the book, I watched the Campion film starring Nicole Kidman. Besides an evocative score and a brilliant performance by Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle and a suitably slimy one by John Malkovich (basically changing costumes from his Dangerous Liaisons character), it was dreadfully dull. There have been other James adaptations \u2013 The Wings Of The Dove, The Golden Bowl, The Bostonians \u2013 but none of these films has achieved the critical or popular success of an Age Of Innocence, Howards End or Room With A View. Maybe it's hard to get that psychological complexity onscreen? Read the books.***Conclusion: James is The Master. Up til now, I\u2019d only read his shorter works, like the novellas \u201cThe Turn Of The Screw,\u201d \u201cDaisy Miller\u201d (I still don\u2019t quite know what killed her - sorry if that\u2019s a spoiler) and \u201cThe Beast In The Jungle.\u201d Now I\u2019m eyeing his other major novels; perhaps I\u2019ll even get through the notoriously difficult late period James. Can't wait to try!"], ["For my dear friend Jeffrey Keeten: I would not have read it if it were not for you. Thanks! Henry James\u2019 The Portrait of a Lady touched me deeply. Since I finished this novel a few days ago, I could not seem to stop thinking about it as I tried to organize my feelings. That I was mesmerized by it, there is no doubt. So much that the search for its understanding has occupied practically all my free moments. And to fully grasp it I could not do without Henry James masterful help, so forgive me if you find I quote him too often. Oh, but this is a work in progress, so forgive me again for any inaccuracy or inconsistency. 1. The complexity of Isabel Archer\n\"Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The novel is of its very nature an ado, an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for\u2014for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.\"\nPortrait of a Lady is the story of a young American woman, Isabel Archer, and her voyage of self-discovery. I loved getting into Isabel's conflicted mind, her doubts and her confidence, her wishes and her choices. I went even further and identified thoroughly with Isabel Archer. I could relate to her conflicted mind, her dreams and ultimate choices. She was a pleasure to know, because she is so extraordinarily complex, complex in a way that fictional people seldom are.From the first we learn how Isabel valued her freedom, in a dialogue with her cousin Ralph:\n\"\u2018Adopted me?\u2019 The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain...\u2018Oh no; she has not adopted me. I\u2019m not a candidate for adoption.\u2019\u2018I beg a thousand pardons,\u2019 Ralph murmured. \u2018I meant... \u2018You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up... but,\u2019 she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, \u2018I\u2019m very fond of my liberty.\u2019\"\nThe secondary characters are there to explain Isabel Archer, as Henry James tells us \u201cthey are there, for what they are worth\u2026 the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer\u2019s history. I recognized them, I knew them, they were numbered pieces of my puzzle, the concrete term of my \u2018plot\u2019.\u201dMrs. Touchett, her aunt, brings Isabel to Europe but is indifferent and unfeeling; Ralph is initially amused by her and helps her to inherit a fortune, only to guarantee her choices and the freedom to follow them (he probably is the only one that thoroughly loved Isabel); Madam Merle manages her meeting with Osmond and makes sure they end up married; Osmond thinks of her as one more item for his collection; Mr. Goodwood is persistent and never loses interest in her life (coming back again and again to see how she is), but seems to offer nothing more; Lord Warburton is a fair aristocratic friend to Isabel, but was he truly in love with her or merely looking for a trophy wife?; Henrietta Stackpole, is a true friend and probably an antithesis to Isabel; and Pansy, the artless creation of her husband, depends on Isabel as the only person who throughly loves her. So everyone, including the reader, look upon her, judge her decisions and contemplate as she takes each of her fateful steps into her destiny.Oh, there is much more about Isabel, and I hope I will be able to know her better once I am finished.2. The images and metaphors of Isabel Archer\u2019s lifeTo discuss this I first I want to tell you about a recurrent dream I had for a very long time. Sometimes, I dreamed that I was walking down the corridor on my home and discovered a door I had never realized existed; deciding to explore I would open it and it led me to a new, endless row of rooms, all grand with high windows and sunny, overlooking majestic gardens that I had never observed existed before. As I opened each door amazing new discoveries were revealed to me. My feelings were of exuberance, of happiness to have discovered so much beauty inside my home. But there was a variation to these recurrent dreams, or worst, there were also nightmares. In these I also discovered new places never visited before, however they would be dark and looked nowhere. As a result of this oppressive atmosphere I used to feel like I was in an endless prison inside my own home. I rejoiced in the first and feared to revisit those nightmares.So, when I started reading The Portrait of a Lady, it was fascinating to read how Henry James uses symbolic or metaphorical architectural spaces and places to tell us about Isabel Archer and her life. This was something I knew and it remitted directly to my dreams and my deepest self. \n\"Her imagination was by habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging.\"\nWe first meet Isabel at Gardencourt,\n\"Her uncle\u2019s house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. The large, low rooms, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a \u2018property\u2019\u2014...much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions\"\nBy marrying Osmond Isabel ends up enveloped in a palace dark and suffocating:\n\"She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of suffocation. Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air; Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her.\"\nThere, she seeks refuge or consolation on the ruins of Rome, for her a symbol of hope for despite their long sufferings they are still standing.\n\"She had long before this taken old Rome into her confidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places, so that as she sat in a sun-warmed angle on a winter\u2019s day, she could smile at it and think of its smallness.\"\nBut, ultimately, she seeks refuge once more at Gardencourt.\n\"All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desire too save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge. Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth in her strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place had been a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now.\"\n3. Isabel\u2019s choices and freedomIsabel's ability to choose, and the choices she makes are the thread that is carefully woven throughout the novel, and it raises her stature as a fictional heroine, in my opinion, to the level of that of an Anna Karenina or an Emma Bovary. For better or for worse. \n\"\u2018I\u2019m not bent on a life of misery,\u2019 said Isabel. \u2018I\u2019ve always been intensely determined to be happy, and I\u2019ve often believed I should be. I\u2019ve told people that. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself.\u2019\u2018By separating yourself from what?\u2019\u2018From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer.\u2019\"\nThe moment Isabel inherits starts the process whereupon she loses some of her freedom\u2026\n\"There\u2019s one remarkable clause in my husband\u2019s will,\u2019 Mrs Touchett added. \u2018He has left my niece a fortune.\u2019\u2018A fortune!\u2019 Madame Merle softly repeated.\u2018Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds.\u2019Madame Merle\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, still clasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, a little dilated... \u2018Ah,\u2019 she cried, \u2018the clever creature!\u2019\"\nAnd around Isabel there is always a sense of danger: \n\"\u2018I try to care more about the world than about myself\u2013\u2013but I always come back to myself. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 She stopped; her voice had trembled a little. \u2018Yes, I\u2019m afraid; I can\u2019t tell you. A large fortune means freedom, and I\u2019m afraid of that. It\u2019s such a fine thing, and one should make such a good use of it. If one shouldn\u2019t one would be ashamed... I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not a greater happiness to be powerless.\u2019\"\nBut was she really free or were her choices not as free as she dreamed? Or was it all inevitable to some degree? It seems that Isabel Archer's life was to some extend inescapable and this fact was not totally unknown to her. However, she thoroughly recongnizes how misguided she had been in her choice of husband. \n\"It was as if he had had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune. Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him? This mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life; a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered.\"\nSubsequentely, Isabel remains too proud to show it to the her friends. But despite all her efforts to conceal her misery, she cannot camouflage it from Ralph and Caspar: \n\"\u2018Watching her?\u2019\u2018Trying to make out if she's happy.\u2019\u2018That's easy to make out,\u2019 said Ralph. \u2018She\u2019s the most visibly happy woman I know.\u2019\u2018Exactly so; I\u2019m satisfied,\u2019 Goodwood answered dryly. For all his dryness, however, he had more to say. \u2018I\u2019ve been watching her. She pretends to be happy; that was what she undertook to be; and I thought I should like to see for myself what it amounts to. I\u2019ve seen,\u2019 he continued with a harsh ring in his voice, \u2018and I don\u2019t want to see any more. I\u2019m now quite ready to go.\u2019\"\nSorrowful and heartbroken, that's how this passage made me feel. But she is never to be pitied, she always stands upright despite doomed adversity. Yes, I suspect there is a sense of inevitability (what choices did she have, where her other suitors conductive of real happiness? I think not!) which could have made Isabel Archer\u2019s into a tragedy. But she is far from it, she still has choices. Nevertheless, James\u2019 work is not merely that. It is a reflection upon the ideal of a relative freedom and a play with its execution in a woman\u2019s life; the actions, its struggles and the consequent decisions taken by choice. This is what James has achieved with this work; that liberty is not only an ideal but a responsibility too. Though the reader may not approve of all her choices at the end, keeping in mind the betrayal of trust brought about by Madam Merle and Osmond, they were all freely taken or the result of her own will. A will which comes not merely from the limitations imposed by society, but by a newfound maturity, result of all her suffering, and above all from the vow to remain true to oneself. 4. Henry James gives the reader plenty of room to imagineThere\u2019s something about Henry James\u2019 work, and here in particular, that flares, tosses back and forth with unspoken frustration and desire. James\u2019 art, the one thing that makes him stand out for me, is in how he somehow implies, suggests, hints, but never outright tells the reader the ins and outs of his story. He even skips years, and it only adds to its enjoyment. If you want to live along with Isabel Archer, and I felt like I did, is to be conquered by infinite possibilities. Here we are not mere spectator or bystanders but may live everything along with her, if we want to. It is a hard reading that requires effort, but if we invest in it we can grasp the possibilities the whole world that exists beneath the surface of his work.5. Her ultimate choiceIsabel falls for Gilbert Osmond, to my mind, partly because he does not mindlessly adore her, does not fawn over her. He takes his time in the courtship, he (with the help of Madame Merle) has a clear strategy and it works. He is mysterious, indolent; and there is the hint of a darker side. He appears to be tired of everything, simply bored, so Isabel feels like for once she is helping somebody. That her inheritance has a meaning, a destiny. She seems to feel recompensated and fulfilled.\n\"...\u2018What has he ever done?\u2019 he added abruptly.\u2018That I should marry him? Nothing at all,\u2019 Isabel replied while her patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. \u2018If he had done great things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr Goodwood; I\u2019m marrying a perfect nonentity. Don\u2019t try to take an interest in him. You can\u2019t.\u2019\"\nAnd we are not the only ones to be surprised by her choice to marry Gilbert Osmond. Ralph was appalled:\n\"\u2018I think I\u2019ve hardly got over my surprise,\u2019 he went on at last. \u2018You were the last person I expected to see caught.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know why you call it caught.\u2019\u2018Because you\u2019re going to be put into a cage.\u2019\u2018If I like my cage, that needn\u2019t trouble you,\u2019 she answered....\u2018You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.\u2019\"\nBut she still has another choice ahead of her. Her ultimate choice is whether or not to return to Osmond after she goes to Gardencourt to visit her dying cousin. Again Henry James gifts us with a superb image that could not translate better the pervading dread of what she is about to do:\n\"There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started.\"\nAnd at last we understand her ultimate decision, although such resolution is not easily reached. \n\"There were lights in the windows of the house; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time\u2014for the distance was considerable\u2014she had moved through the darkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then she put her hand on the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a very straight path.\"\nIn the end I recognized a worthier and more mature Isabel Archer, and I think that she comes out of her sufferings stronger. I would like to imagine Osmond would be surprised by her when she gets back to Rome, and that she would be able to change her standing. Their roles perhaps altered. Although there should certainly be more anguish ahead of her, given what she is going back to, I imagine there is always the possibility of happiness.______"], ["I've been reading a lot of Anthony Trollope's books recently and the stories, characters and writing is so much superior to this that I just can't get into it. \"Frothy\" is a word that comes to mind, also \"was he paid by the word?\" like Dickens. I finished the book, finally. It was a chore. I did not find James' portrayal of a woman's personality convincing. That even though she had the financial power which was the reason why her husband had married her, she would still allow herself to be physically and emotionally abused and humiliated. It seemed to be a very conventional view of a woman, that eventually she would give in to her Lord and Master. A woman with an ounce of independence (she did have an ounce, maybe even two) at the beginning would not be the sad creature she was at the end. Marriages were made in light of money and status in those times, in this book, she had both, he had neither, there had to be some sort of mental shift that that would allow her to pretend that these were her husband's and she was in the lower and grateful position. But James didn't write it, so 'Portrait' really didn't make sense.None of the characters, evil, good or milk-water gained my sympathy. Pansy, the daughter, nearly did, but I wanted to shake her and say 'how could you have lived all these years and not suspected who your mother is? Your father has palmed you off on the nuns all these years, what's with this unquestioning obedience? Its your step-mother has the money, not him, she's the one who can help you, would help you,not your daddy who just wants you to achieve his own social-climbing ambitions'. I just don't see James as a man who understood women enough to write about them from any but a man's perspective.I watched the Nichole Kidman film of the book and although Kidman did her best to flesh out the character she was no more rounded than in the book. And Poppy's submissiveness and ignorance were even more unbelievable. Obviously, to James, the main characteristic he associated with women and interpreted thusly by the director, was submissiveness.Henry James may have deserved his reputation as a Grand Old Man of (American) letters, but not through this book, it just didn't do it for me."], ["I had many wonderful moments while reading this book, moments when the writing halted the reading, when I had to pause and admire and wonder. Moments when the book seemed to speak to my own experience as if it were written expressly for the girl who was me at twenty-two, causing me to wonder how Henry James could have guessed so well the presumptuous ideas I had about life and love at that early stage. All of that is very personal, of course, and not necessarily of interest to other readers, but there were other moments in my reading of The Portrait of a Lady that better merit mention in a review. I had read this book before, about twenty years ago, so although I knew the bare bones of the story, I remembered few of the details. I certainly had no recollection of the early scene in which Isabel Archer walks in on an unknown guest in her aunt\u2019s house. And yet there was something about the lead-up to that scene that caught my attention this time: the house is very still because Isabel\u2019s uncle is dying. Out of the silence comes the sound of someone playing the piano. Wonderingly, Isabel makes her way toward the source of the harmony. Those six words were like a bell ringing in my mind. I felt a sharpening of interest, an awareness of how pivotal this moment would be in the story. I remember thinking: I've been reading this book with all senses on alert and this is my reward; I've sensed the author\u2019s excitement at the turn his story is about to take. There was another scene later in the book when I had a similar feeling of change about to happen: Isabel sits up late one night in Rome pondering a difficult decision, indeed pondering all the decisions in her life so far. The reader watches with her and wonders how she will act. And wonders again when she finally does.There are other major shifts in the narrative but none stood out for me quite the way those two did. In fact, Henry James purposely avoids describing the most significant shift of all, skipping a three-year section of Isabel\u2019s life completely - which is a very effective narrative device of course, introducing both surprise and suspense in a story that has only a six-year span in total. As a reader I appreciated both strategies: the emphasis he seemed to place on some scenes and the complete omission he allowed to others. It was all very wonderful. In fact this book has revised my idea of what \u2018wonderful\u2019 means. 'The Portrait of a Lady' is vying for a place as the highlight of my Henry James reading year even though The Ambassadors was already firmly camped in that position. I've decided they can be the joint highlight - they have a lot of wonderfulness in common.When I finished 'The Portrait', I turned to HJ\u2019s 1906 appendix and found a paragraph about his concerns for the reader. He writes that he has purposely piled brick upon brick for our benefit, carefully including the details that will enable us to grasp the totality of his creation. And among those details, he mentions two in particular, keystones in the building of the story as it were. The first is the piano scene I described earlier. He speaks of the rare chemistry of that scene in which Isabel recognizes that a huge change is about to happen in her life. I felt really validated as a reader to have been aware in advance of the significance of what I was about to read, and so I wasn't surprised when his other pivotal scene turned out to be the one where Isabel sits up late into the Roman night, pondering her decisions. This is the sixteenth Henry James book I've read in six months. Perhaps I've learnt something of the way his writer\u2019s mind works!More confirmation of that possibility came when he began to discuss the shape of this novel. He continues to speak in terms of bricks and architecture and proportions, and he says that of all his novels, 'The Portrait' is the best proportioned with the exception of a novel he was to write twenty-two years later: The Ambassadors. Alongside a certain \u2018roundness\u2019 in shape which they share, he finds they also share a kind of supporting beam or rib that runs through them. This rib is made from two minor but key characters, Henrietta Stackpole and Maria Gostrey. Both seem extraneous to each story at first glance yet both are central to the architecture of their particular story. I remember noting that Maria Gostrey was the thread that allowed me to find my way through the labyrinth that was 'The Ambassadors' so it was wonderful to hear Henry James confirm that, and underline the links between the two books as well. I was also reminded that I had begun to look at his books in terms of architecture while reading The Wings of the Dove, so I really appreciated his architectural metaphors.In fact the appendix left me amazed and wondering at every turn. In the updates, I quoted part of a paragraph on his theories about the \u2018house of fiction\u2019. I'd like to quote the whole thing here because it is really worth reading - and it provided me with huge insights into some Gerald Murnane books I've puzzled over in the past, The Plains and Inland, and offered a strong desire to read his Million Windows:The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million - a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbors are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; \u201cfortunately\u201d by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the \u201cchoice of subject\u201d; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the \u201cliterary form\u201d; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his \u201cmoral\u201d reference.\u2026\u2026\u2026This book is the final one in my 2017 Henry James season and I can't think of a better title to finish on. But in every ending there are beginnings - 'The Portrait' has led me to another book: Henry James says he took the slight \u2018personality\u2019, the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl and created what he called \u2018an ado about Isabel Archer\u2019. That reference has prompted me to go back to Shakespeare and read Much Ado About Nothing. I do love when one book leads to another!"], ["Ugh, ech, the elitism that breeds in readers! We think we're such nicey cosy bookworms and wouldn't harm a fly but we seethe, we do. Of course, readers of books just naturally look down on those who don't read at all. In fact they try not to think of those people (nine tenths of the human race I suppose, but a tenth of the human race is still a big number) because it makes them shudder. (How lovely it would be to go riding in a carriage through some dreadful council estate flinging free copies of Ulysses and Mrs Dalloway right and left (although Ulysses might catch some of those urchins a hefty blow on the temple (which might cause a shift in their brain landscape and evoke a sudden craving for modernist novels, like when people are struck by a bus and wake up talking in a French accent, that can happen))). So that's one obvious kind of reader elitism. But then, some readers think that what the majority of readers actually read is appalling (Hungervinciboneskitehelpslappery Twilit Shades of Pottery doo dah). It's not that you read, it's what you read. Of course. And then, amongst those elevated readers, some literary authors are considered greater than some others (why are you wasting your time with William Gaddis when you could be knee-deep in Proust, dwarling? I simply don't understand it). And then, even when you scale the heights and find yourself munching down some Henry James like he was the last well-done steak (with Chateau Lafleur) you were going to get before your solo trek (no huskies) to the south pole, you still get it - oh dwarling, why are you still dillydallying in the Middle Period when you still haven't read The Golden Bowl you naughty Jamesian you!Thus it is that I say - oh no, not The Portrait of a Lady. Too too obvious. Try The Awkward Age or The Ambassadors. Much better."], ["Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady is considered to be one of the first American novels to make full use of social and psychological realism as European authors - such as Flaubert, Balzac and George Eliot - were already practicing in their works. Considered to be his biggest accomplishment along with The Ambassadors, Portrait added Isabel Archer to the company of great fictional heroines - as the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, Becky Sharp and Jane Eyre - and, in a century marked by unsatisfied bourgeois wives and adultery in fiction - Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina come to mind -, it was a breath of fresh air to accompany and delve into James' protagonist's thoughts and inner feelings.Starting with a very slow pace, the narrative contains long and elaborate descriptions. It feels James is painting a richly detailed picture for every scene. As we arrive in Gardencourt - the Touchett's English country estate where our story opens and closes -, we encounter Mr. Touchett, his son Ralph and a family friend called Lord Warburton. Among other things, they discuss how Mrs. Lydia Touchett is in America and will bring along her niece called Isabel Archer to visit Europe.Isabel is a young woman, from Albany, New York, who accepts her aunt's offer to initially stay with her in Gardencourt and then later travel through the continent, eager to explore and be enriched by the places she's never been before and experience life at its fullest. Upon her arrival, we begin to learn what her ideals and plans are, along with her hopes and dreams.Since the beginning, her cousin Ralph seems to have been as curious as we were to see what Isabel would make of her life. In a way, we almost could say Ralph was conducting an experiment: Isabel had an independent mind, she was emotionally and psychologically self-sufficient - didn't seem inclined to get married for the time being, which was different for a girl of her age at the time. She was thirsty for knowledge first and foremost: \u201cI don\u2019t want to begin life by marrying\u201d, Isabel asserts to Ralph. \u201cThere are other things a woman can do.\" But without money, how far could she go with her unattached ways? She was probably bound to eventually getting married. Her cousin, then, arranged it and she became financially independent as well. Certain that he was doing Isabel a good deed, Ralph convinced his father - who was very fond of Isabel - at his deathbed to leave her an impressive amount of money. Now she had all that was necessary to decide her destiny without any barriers or anyone to hold her back. The experiment was on.After traveling for over a year, the now wealthy Isabel Archer is in Florence, where her aunt lives. A friend she greatly admired, Madame Merle - Mrs. Touchett's close friend who Isabel got acquainted with some time after she arrived in Gardencourt - skillfully introduces her to Gilbert Osmond: an American expatriate widower who's lived in Italy for years. Isabel is very impressed with his refinement and intelligence and thinks of him as having a beautiful mind. Despite her family and friends complaints about this relationship, Isabel - after having declined two previous suitors - accepts Osmond's marriage proposal.The story then jumps in time and there's a narrative shift: for a bit, James leaves Isabel and Osmond in the background while he focuses on Pansy Osmond - Osmond's young daughter - and Edward Rosier - Isabel's childhood friend who's in love with Miss Osmond and is trying to get Madame Merle to help him marry his darling girl. Through their story, we still have glimpses of Isabel's life and we learn that she's been now married for two years and that she lost a son who died six months after his birth. Isabel and her husband seems to disagree about everything and we learn she's unhappy.Henry James, who once conducted a very slow paced - almost contemplative - narrative, gradually started to accelerate it, adding drama and a sense of urgency to his words. Right after an unsettling argument with Osmond one evening, Isabel, now feeling more distraught than ever, starts pondering and analyzing the many circumstances she finds herself in. The author immerses us in a deeply personal and intensely psychological account of her thoughts and emotions. Among the things Isabel reflected upon for a long time were the conclusion that her husband must hate her and the realization that Osmond had gained total control of her - the once independent and strong witted woman was now a subjugated spirit; the woman who once seemed to be against doing what was expected of her was now conforming to her husband's decisions. \"When the clock struck four she got up; she was going to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets.\"Complicating things even further is the revelation Countess Gemini - Osmond's sister - makes to Isabel of a long time secret, that leaves her completely shaken. This only comes to deteriorate even more her relationship with Gilbert. Now, fully aware of the situation she was put in through manipulations and schemes, Isabel is faced with a big decision: her cousin Ralph is dying in Gardencourt and her dictatorial husband is completely against her visiting England. Showing the old Isabel may still be somewhere locked inside of herself, she confronts her husband and leaves to be with her cousin.The Portrait of a Lady, through its length, presents a number of opposites, but the most striking ones are the battles between freedom vs. destiny and affection vs. betrayal. In the book's final moments, we witness that Isabel is offered a way to go back to where and to whom she was when she first came to Europe: \"The world's all before us - and the world's very big\", she is told. She could once again explore life and fill herself with hopes - but declined the opportunity: \"The world's very small\", she answered. With a much talked about conclusion that has both fascinated and infuriated - another battle of opposites? - readers, James' ending remains open to a lot of interpretations.It's disturbing to watch an unhappily married woman with an opportunity to leave it all behind - and the means to do it - simply not choosing freedom. Did Osmond finally accomplish to shatter her spirit? Another theory is that maybe marriage was an unbreakable vow and she felt she had a moral duty to her husband. Or was she trying to be protective of Pansy - who was mirroring Isabel's unhappiness and was another example of a woman who seemed to think that she was obliged to follow other's decisions even if it made her unhappy - and determined to stand by her side and not let the same happen to her step daughter? Innumerable possibilities...James has been known for structuring his novels with a series of circles surrounding a center. With that in mind, a hopeful interpretation of the book's ending is that, in order to complete that circle, Isabel must return to her husband, properly end her marriage so she could once again be able to start anew and free her spirit once and for all.Rating: for such an interesting and comprehensive analysis of freedom, human consciousness and ultimately, existentialism: 4 stars."], ["Book Review\n\n3+ out of 5 stars for The Portrait of a Lady, a classic story called the \"Great American Novel,\" written by Henry James in 1881. I adore Henry James and found great enjoyment in his literary works when I began reading him in my freshmen year at college. As an English major, I was exposed to many different authors, but I felt a strong connection with him and this literary period. American realistic works spoke to me above any of the other \"classic\" books I had been reading. As a result, I chose Henry James as the primary focus of an independent study course I'd taken in my senior year. I read 6 or 7 of his books during those 3 months and am going back now to provide quick reviews, as not everyone finds him as enjoyable as I do. I also don't want to bore everyone with a lengthy review on how to interpret him or his books.The Portrait of a Lady tells the story of a young woman who years to have her own life and make her own mark on the world. She doesn't want to be contained by marriage or the structure in place at the time in the late 19th century. She has different characteristics coming from American, English and continental European female archetypes. She has strong moral and ethical values. She knows who she is, yet she does not know all. As she moves through life, she makes choices that are not easy for her to execute. What I loved about this work is its deep exploratory view points, beautiful language and unparalleled characters. Though I only give it a 3, when compared to some of this other works, I would recommend you read a few chapters or sections, just to see if it is something you could find yourself getting lost in.The impact you feel upon reading this book is questioning what is the true view of a lady, how is she different from generation to generate, location to location and societal class to societal class. James knows women. He is very accurate on many levels... wrong on a few, too. But to put out his thoughts, in a huge tome, at a time when women were beginning to get more rights... and be able to cross genres and genders... is amazing. It's less about what he says and more about how he says it. And that's why I enjoy reading him... but even I admit, I can only take 1 book every few years! :)\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Isabel Archer is a young American lady, for whom the novel is titled, who is adventurous and very independent. She turns down two marriage proposals in the 1st half of the book to preserve her independence, one from Casper Goodwood, a young wealthy American, and one from Lord Warburton, a wealthy English aristocrat. When her English uncle dies, she inherits a large sum of money and travels with her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, to her Italian villa where she eventually meets, falls in love with, and marries Gilbert Osmond. All of her family and friends try to dissuade her from this, but to no avail, and she finally learns that Osmond doesn't love her, married her for her money, and to own her as another of his possessions. Obviously there is a lot more intrigue to the story and the enjoyment for me came from the wonderful writing of James."], ["Exquisite, cozy, at times funny, at times sad, and unforgettable. I won\u2019t bore readers with another summary of the story; they\u2019re abundant on this site. I will say that with Isabel Archer, James earns his place in the canon with a proto-feminist (yes, I said it, proto-feminist) novel of a remarkable, if hard to describe heroine, who is faithful to her idea(l)s, rejects the affections of strong (but good) men, and suffers unnecessarily at the hands of a Machiavellian cad and an equally manipulative woman. If you don\u2019t like long novels\u2014avoid this one like a plague. If you don\u2019t like novels written in style from another era, get thee hence! If wordy, complicated sentences are anathema to you, you\u2019ve probably already stopped reading this mini-review.If I were to advise a reader at all, I\u2019d suggest reading it in as short a period as you can. Bite the bullet, finish it off keeping as much in mind as you can. I\u2019d also advise reading it on a Kindle (for the built-in dictionary) or, at the very least, keep a dictionary at hand. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have; and if you don\u2019t\u2014if you read the wrong book for you (this one), please, please, don\u2019t say James is an idiot (or some equivalent) or that the book is just boring (or some equivalent)\u2014instead, face the fact, you read the wrong book."]], "review_count": "9", "description": "When Isabel Archer, a beautiful, spirited American, is brought to Europe by her wealthy Aunt Touchett, it is expected that she will soon marry.

It is worth having this book purely to read Anthony Burgess' introduction if nothing else.I was particularly taken with Burgess' statement:\"Anyone looking in his (Miller's) essay for a detailed critical account of Rimbaud's work, or a study of his life, will be disappointed. That kind of thing can be safely left to Enid Starkie. Miller is using Rimbaud as a pretext to deliver his own judgements on the world and to affirm that the boy poet was a prophet of the final collapse of civilization in the twentieth century. The essay was written in 1946, after the potential of the atomic bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Miller can be excused for believing that the collapse of civilized order was coming, if not the extinction of mankind itself. Rimbaud as a prophet of breakdown - the time of the assassins - and Miller, feeling himself to be something of a prophet too, found an affinity with the poet.\"An excellent book and highly recommended."], ["I haven't read anything by either Henry Miller or Arthur Rimbaud. I know that must make me sound stupid, but it's the truth, and thought this, a study of Rimbaud by Miller, would be an interesting intro to the both of them. I wasn't expecting it to be a perfect companion to nearly all of the thought I had been working through this year, from Nietzsche to Foucault, Freud, and Kristeva, it brought everything together in a blindsiding of interpretation.It's about Rimbaud, but more about his life as an example of the trials and travails of the artist/thinker in the 19th century. Miller is of course quick to point out that things haven't changed, and poets of all kinds still face the hardships that thwarted Rimbaud. In so doing It provides the clearest and most concise interpretation of 19th century thought and literature that I've ever come across without really trying.Oh, and it's beautiful:\"Rimbaud plucks his heart out and devours it slowly. And so the world gradually comes to resemble the time of the curse. The birds drop from the air, dead before they arrive. The wild beasts gallop to the sea and plunge. The grass withers, the seed rots. Nature takes on the barren, deformed look of a miser, and the heavens mirror the emptiness of the earth. The poet, jaundiced from riding the wild mare over lakes of steaming asphalt, slits its throat. In vain he flaps his rudimentary wings. The Fabulous opera collapses and howling wind rends the props. Save for the furious and most ancient witches, the heath is deserted. Like harpies, armed each and every one with grappling hooks, they fall upon him. Theirs is a more earnest greeting than that visionary brush with his Satanic Majesty.

But there's a certain retrospective concision and focus in this book that gives Miller the platform he needs in a way dissimilar and unique to Tropic of Cancer. And seeing as almost all his books following Tropic of Cancer and Black Spring are pale shadows of the joy, rebellion, and experimentation of those works, this book stands alone as one of his best for distancing itself from his drained out autobio fiction saga by then submerged in morasses of the past, sluggish, ugly things. Oscar Wilde on being released from prison could no longer write because the suffering of it had stifled his joy and pleasure. Rimbaud could no longer write because poetry did not bestow him the intangible grandeur he'd desired so before. But Miller kept writing through all things, he painted here and there, and I forget if he wrote to his dying day, but he was okay with dredging up the past time and time again, he was a metaphysical randy as all hell huckster. When he writes about America, there's not one good word, which I appreciate but it's not fun reading. For me all his best work is about Paris and the French, and so is this one via Rimbaud.Quotes:What we obviously lack in America, what we are not even aware we lack, is the dreamer, the inspired madperson.As the voice of the poet becomes stifled, history loses its meaning and the eschatological promise bursts like a new and frightening dawn upon the consciousness of humanity.It is the past which is engulfing us, not the future. The future always has and always will belong to the poet.I believe that the dreamer, no matter how impractical they may appear to the man in the street, is a thousand times more capable, more efficient than the statesman.The only law which is really lived up to whole-heartedly and with a vengeance is the law of conformity.Humanity's greatest dread is the expansion of consciousness. All the fearsome, gruesome part of mythology stems from this fear. \"Let us live in peace and harmony!\" begs the little man. But the law of the universe dictates that peace and harmony can only be won by inner struggle. (Infinitist deconditioned logic)Whose voice is it that now makes itself heard, the poet's or the scientist's? Are we thinking of beauty, however bitter, or are we thinking of atomic energy? And what is the chief emotion which our great discoveries now inspire? Dread! We have knowledge without wisdom, comfort without security, belief without faith. The poetry of life is expressed only in terms of the mathematical, the physical, the chemical. The poet is the pariah, an anomaly. They are on the way to extinction. Who cares now how monstrous they make themselves? We have never thought of power in terms of good, only in terms of evil.What humans want are food, shelter, clothing--basic things--not money.And for the rebel above all humans it is necessary to know love, to give it even more than to receive it, and to be it even more than to give it.He is in our world but not of it; his allegiance is elsewhere. It is his mission to seduce us, to render intolerable this limited world which bounds us. (4D human being)The scientist's instinct for life is pervertedFor both Rimbaud and Van Gogh the cup of bitterness was filled to overflowing (like Denis before the 60s)Humanity's greatest desire is to burn with ecstasy, to commerge out little flame with the central fire of the universeAnd life for the modern human had become an eternal Hell for the simple reason that they have lost all hope for attaining paradise. They do not even believe in a paradise of their own creation.The true ancestors of the visionaries live in the future, distant humans much unlike the past. He changes identity so thoroughly that if he were to pass himself on the road he would not recognize himself. This is perhaps the last desperate way of tricking madness--to become so utterly sane that one does not know one is insane.All forms, all orders of being from the angels to the worms, are struggling to communicate with those above and below (communication through the chain of being to free consciousness to unshackle perception)The sage remains silent after the creation of their values to give voice to them in silence and have them heard that much more.Similarly, he refused to recognize an ideal society composed of soul-less bodies manipulated from their political or economic centersNarcism introduces a fear greater than all others--the loss of identity.Let us have a new heaven and a new earth!--that was the sense of Rimbaud's obstinate revoltThe moral crisis of the 19th century has merely given way to the spiritual bankruptcy of the 20th."]], "review_count": "1", "description": "We're all familiar with the American spirit.

Coulombe"}, "Writing": {"average_rating": "3.75", "review": [["A rather slight piece containing what appears to be some of the thoughts floating about in Duras' head on the subject of writing, circa 1993. These tend to take the form of short paragraphs or single lines, though two at least become vignettes and \"chapters\" of a sort. Overall, the work gives the impression of the sort of notes you might write when preparing to give a speech where you want just the right phrase- attacking and re-attacking a single idea from different angles.At first, Duras' thoughts focus (loosely) around the country house she writes in and the \"solitude\" she finds there, both literally and figuratively. It's reminiscent of A Room of One's Own, really, only less incisive and cutting, and more... image seeking. Woolf sought to set out and make a case for, at least for the most part, a practical set of conditions for success. Duras is seeking only to describe them- and they are almost exclusively mental conditions (given some material help from certain external aids) created by the writer herself. Then the thing takes a roundabout left turn brought on by a free association somewhere in her descriptions of the village near her house and suddenly we are talking more and more about death. Writing as death, death as bringing on and inspiring writing, death's impact on her \"solitude\", it's impact on her memories and the formation of her psyche- especially the lingering impact of the Second World War. And we end, Before Sunset-like, wandering through ruined Rome and discussing death and life and writing and unspoken longing until we wander right off the page.I struggled to interpret this one. My historian's brain kept placing this in the context of its publication- 1993 brought about a resurgence of interest in WWII (the Maastricht Treaty process had dragged up a lot of old, unseasonable memories, Mitterand's checkered past with Vichy was about to come to light, the last Nazis were being rounded up and put on trial, WWI vets were scarce and WWII vets had begun to die in larger numbers, and there was a high-profile suicide on the socialist Left). Is that what all this rage against the Germans and the heavy-handed description of the death of the fly - seriously, it went on for several pages- was about? I understand it as an exploration of the writer's observational instinct, but I think that that was a secondary concern in Duras' thoughts at best.Or was she genuinely just another dying relic of a bygone age- France was full of them at this time- for whom the past was nearer than the seemingly surreal, unsatisfying present? It makes sense. There's a big element of the public discussion in France that's still that way.(There's a lament for '68 in here, too.)That might explain why her writing felt somewhat dated as well- for example the existentialist/minimalist toned final chapter in Rome. It felt like a frozen, boiled down shadow of Hiroshima, Mon Amour. Someone more well versed than me would have to tell me whether Duras always wrote like this- that is if her writing had not changed significantly since the war, or whether this is a throwback.It all made for a rather aimless, anachronistic, occasionally preachy experience. I can see how this fits into the fabric of its time, but I'm outside the cultural memories that might make this particular sort of melodrama work for me.However, I should highlight some individually lovely lines. This is still Duras. These are the reason to read: \"There should be a writing of non-writing. Someday it will come. A brief writing, without grammar, a writing of the words alone. Words without supporting grammar. Lost. Written, there. And immediately left behind.\"\"The inside of the church is truly admirable. One can recognize everything. The flowers are flowers, the plants, the colors, the altars, the embroideries, the tapestries. It's admirable. Like a temporarily abandoned room awaiting lovers who haven't arrived yet because of bad weather.\"\"A solitary house doesn't simply exist. It needs time around it, people, histories, \"turning points,\" things like marriage or the death of that fly, death, banal death the death of one and the many at the same time; planetary, proletarian death. The kind that comes with war, those mountains of war on Earth.\"\"Before me, no one had written in this house. I asked the mayor, my neighbors, the shopkeepers. No. Never. I often phoned Versailles to try to find out the names of the people who had lived in this house. In the list of the inhabitants' last names and their first names and their professions, there were never any writers. Now, all those names could have been the names of writers. But no. Around here there were only family farms. What I found buried in the ground were German garbage pits. The house had been in fact occupied by German officers. Their garbage pits were holes. There were a lot of oyster shells, empty tins of expensive foodstuffs... And much broken china. We threw all of it out. Except the debris of china, without a doubt Sevres porcelain: the designs were intact. And the blue was the innocent blue in the eyes of certain of our children.\"And finally:\"There is a madness of writing that is in oneself, an insanity of writing, but that alone doesn't make one insane. On the contrary. Writing is the unknown. Before writing one knows nothing of what one is about to write. And in total lucidity.It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one side of oneself, parallel to oneself, another person who appears and comes forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes through his own actions, risks losing his life.\""], ["Uhhhhhh.

In fact, I initially thought that the whole book was about writing, so that was slightly disappointing, albeit my own fault. What was more seriously disappointing was the collection itself, which really wasn't as interesting or as good as I had expected it to be. Only Writing was worth reading, if I'm honest, and even that only had its moments, with an occasional passage that stood out. Perhaps if I had previously read Duras I would have been more interested or more lenient\u2014as it stands, on its own, the collection left me unmoved and, too often, impatient with the generalities and annoyed at the inconsistencies. An example of one of the more stand-out moments:\"If one had any idea what one were to write, before doing it, before writing, one would never write. It wouldn't be worth it.\" (44)You read it and you nod along, considering it quite profound. But then you think, wait a minute? Aren't there ideas\u2014stories\u2014in the minds of writers that they think need to be told, and that they therefore go on to write? Isn't this just as true, if not truer, than what Duras just wrote? Surely, an entire book doesn't come ready-made, but some of the greatest works have materialized precisely because their writers felt that an idea needed to be shared, that a story had to be told. As if Steinbeck did not have East of Eden in mind! Of course, this is Duras's personal account of writing. But while unconventionality is nice, it needs to be grounded in something substantial in order to become meaningful.

It's a bizarre chapter/story; it reads like a warped mini-play.* * *The fourth chapter is a quick (possibly too quick) essay on \"purity.\" Duras claims purity is a sacred concept in every culture. + Purity is an obsession in Christianity. + The insane preoccupation with purity led to the murder of millions of Jews in WWII. + Clearly, purity is ridiculous and others ought to be aware of the insidiousness of this seemingly innocent notion.* * *The fifth and final chapter is about an artist who is setting up his painting exhibition. He is a nervous man with frenetic energy; classic lovable weirdo.

You are already zapped of energy. You feel like going to a bar and have a couple of beer listening to a funky live band or the crooning of a lovely young lady. Or you want to go to a nearby mall and sit in the comfort of a dark movie house. Probably sleep to rest for a couple of hours if the movie turns out to be boring.But you decide to go as you planned at the start of the day. Your gym bag is in your car. You drag your heavy feet to the parking lot. To the gym. You know you have to do it your friend has been telling you that Henry James is good but you imagine the taste of cold beer quenching your thirst or the soft seat inside the theater or the pretty songbird wearing a plunging neckline or showing her slim smooth legs there are quick reads waiting for you like Ray Bradbury\u2019s Farenheit 451 or that Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes. But you know your body needs exercise. You are becoming fatter, heavier and your waistline is expanding. You resisted the quick but empty lure of beer or sleep at the movie house. Your heart is telling you that Henry James is an author to read. Like a zombie, you continued sleepwalking to the gym.After changing to your gym attire. You step on the treadmill. The solitude of working out. In the gym, you rarely talk to anyone. Henry James used a style that was distinctively his: wordy yet illuminating You are by yourself. Most of your friends don\u2019t care about Henry James. You begin to walk. Warm up. After a couple of minutes, you increase the speed. Chug. Chug. Chug. It goes on and on. His storytelling went on and on. His characters came from New York, to England, went to Paris, then to Rome and then went back to England and finally went back to Rome. After the treadmill, you lift some weights as you also need to tone some muscles. His characters were varied. There was Isabel Archer fighting for her independence by refusing marriage proposals like there was not tomorrow but in the end she found with the wrong man: conceited, two-timer, treacherous and condescending. Some muscles are not supposed to be exercised right after a neighboring one. They could be contradicting each other and not only you will not get the maximum benefit from your workout but you are in the danger of having an injury like some pulled muscles. Isabel\u2019s cousin Ralph Touchett is the \u201cconscience\u201d of the novel, telling by instinct whether the person-character is good or bad. He is sick but he is the only character that has the purest heart.You came to the gym gloomy and dragged your feet as you did not have the energy even to go up a couple of stairs. Some people agonize reading this kind of 19th century Victorian English But when you came out to go back to your car, you felt energized and refreshed. You felt triumphant that Isabel Archer was going back to Rome for Pansy not necessarily for Oswald. But she decided whatever her heart was telling her. In the end, it was all that mattered: independence. She followed her heart: a personal triumph.  In the end, you did not regret going to the gym. In the end, I am happy I read a Henry James."], ["10 Things I Love About Henry James\u2019s The Portrait Of A Lady1. Isabel ArcherThe \u201clady\u201d in the title. Beautiful, young, headstrong and spirited, the American woman visits her wealthy relatives in England, rejects marriage proposals by two worthy suitors, inherits a fortune and then is manipulated into marrying one of the most odious creatures on the planet, Gilbert Osmond. She\u2019s utterly fascinating, and if I were back in university, I imagine having long conversations and arguments about her character. What does she want: Freedom? The ability to choose, even if it\u2019s a bad choice? Is she a projection of James\u2019s latent homosexuality? Is she a feminist or not? There are no simple answers. 2. The Prose and Psychological ComplexityDamn, James knew how to write long, luxuriant sentences that dig deep into his characters\u2019 minds. Sometimes the effect can be claustrophobic \u2013 get me out of this person\u2019s head! \u2013 but more often it\u2019s utterly compelling and convincing. We partly read fiction to learn about other people\u2019s lives, right? Well, James does that. (The exceptions: Isabel\u2019s two wealthy, handsome suitors, Warburton and Goodwood, are less than believable, and remind me of eager (or horny?) dogs, their tails wagging whenever they\u2019re around their love/lust object.)3. The StoryOkay, not much really happens. But as the book progressed, even though I sort of knew the outcome (it\u2019s hard to avoid spoilers from a 135-year-old classic), I was increasingly curious to see how Isabel would act. In fact, I raced through the final chapters, breathlessly. Who knew: Henry James, page-turner! And have a theory about that ending? Take your turn...4. The HumourIt\u2019s not a comedy, but there are lots of amusing bits. James\u2019s narrator is genial and funny. Henrietta Stackpole, her gentleman friend, Mr. Bantling, and even Gilbert Osmond\u2019s sister, the Countess Gemini, are all very colourful characters who elicit a chuckle or two. And Isabel\u2019s aunt can be terribly cutting as well. I love Ralph (Isabel's cousin) and the dignified British Lord Warburton\u2019s reactions to the enterprising, no-fuss American \u201clady journalist\u201d Henrietta. 5. The SettingsEach one is significant: from the stately Gardencourt, home of Isabel\u2019s relatives the Touchetts, to the bustle and anonymity of London, to the ruins of Rome, where Isabel finds herself stuck in a dead, fossilized marriage. James is a master at finding the right place to stage a scene. I could write an essay about interiors and exteriors in the book, but I\u2019ll spare you.6. The VillainsMadame Merle and Gilbert Osmond: individually they\u2019re sinister, but together they\u2019re positively Machiavellian. In fact, in one scene, it\u2019s revealed that they both like Machiavelli, and Isabel doesn\u2019t get the clue! They totally play her. And yet they\u2019re believable, too. Osmond\u2019s scene in which he professes his love is brilliant in its manipulation; and the final turn of the screw (asking her to do him a favour!) is very clever. Madame Merle\u2019s motivations always keep you guessing. Does she see herself in Isabel? Is she jealous? Does she just want to exert her power over her? The scene in which Isabel sees both in her home, conspiring (evident from their attitudes) is so powerful James refers to it a couple of times. And of course, it\u2019s missing from the Jane Campion film (see below).7. The ThemesDoes money corrupt? What do you really know about someone before you marry? What is the true nature of freedom? What happens when New World (American) \"innocence\" meets Old World (European) \"experience\"? All these themes \u2013 and many others \u2013 come across naturally, and never feel shoe-horned into the story.8. The TechniqueI remember hearing people go on about the architecture of Henry James\u2019s novels, and this one is sturdily, handsomely built. The book begins and ends in the same setting. And there are some ingenious sections in the middle, where time has passed and the reader discovers major information through conversations. Like any great writer, James knows what to leave out. He makes you do work to fill in the pieces, but the novel becomes more memorable because of that. And he bridges the Victorian and Modern eras, in the same way that Beethoven bridges the Classical and Romantic eras.9. Chapter 42After a huge blowup with Osmond, Isabel stays up all night, staring into the fireplace, and ponders her life, thinking: \"How did I get here?\" James considered it one of the best things he\u2019d ever written, and although I haven\u2019t read a lot of his work (which I will soon remedy), I\u2019d have to agree. It\u2019s right up there with Hamlet\u2019s soliloquies.10. The Fact that the Book Doesn't Lend Itself Well To Adaptation A couple days after finishing the book, I watched the Campion film starring Nicole Kidman. Besides an evocative score and a brilliant performance by Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle and a suitably slimy one by John Malkovich (basically changing costumes from his Dangerous Liaisons character), it was dreadfully dull. There have been other James adaptations \u2013 The Wings Of The Dove, The Golden Bowl, The Bostonians \u2013 but none of these films has achieved the critical or popular success of an Age Of Innocence, Howards End or Room With A View. Maybe it's hard to get that psychological complexity onscreen? Read the books.***Conclusion: James is The Master. Up til now, I\u2019d only read his shorter works, like the novellas \u201cThe Turn Of The Screw,\u201d \u201cDaisy Miller\u201d (I still don\u2019t quite know what killed her - sorry if that\u2019s a spoiler) and \u201cThe Beast In The Jungle.\u201d Now I\u2019m eyeing his other major novels; perhaps I\u2019ll even get through the notoriously difficult late period James. Can't wait to try!"], ["For my dear friend Jeffrey Keeten: I would not have read it if it were not for you. Thanks! Henry James\u2019 The Portrait of a Lady touched me deeply. Since I finished this novel a few days ago, I could not seem to stop thinking about it as I tried to organize my feelings. That I was mesmerized by it, there is no doubt. So much that the search for its understanding has occupied practically all my free moments. And to fully grasp it I could not do without Henry James masterful help, so forgive me if you find I quote him too often. Oh, but this is a work in progress, so forgive me again for any inaccuracy or inconsistency. 1. The complexity of Isabel Archer\n\"Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The novel is of its very nature an ado, an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for\u2014for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.\"\nPortrait of a Lady is the story of a young American woman, Isabel Archer, and her voyage of self-discovery. I loved getting into Isabel's conflicted mind, her doubts and her confidence, her wishes and her choices. I went even further and identified thoroughly with Isabel Archer. I could relate to her conflicted mind, her dreams and ultimate choices. She was a pleasure to know, because she is so extraordinarily complex, complex in a way that fictional people seldom are.From the first we learn how Isabel valued her freedom, in a dialogue with her cousin Ralph:\n\"\u2018Adopted me?\u2019 The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain...\u2018Oh no; she has not adopted me. I\u2019m not a candidate for adoption.\u2019\u2018I beg a thousand pardons,\u2019 Ralph murmured. \u2018I meant... \u2018You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up... but,\u2019 she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, \u2018I\u2019m very fond of my liberty.\u2019\"\nThe secondary characters are there to explain Isabel Archer, as Henry James tells us \u201cthey are there, for what they are worth\u2026 the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer\u2019s history. I recognized them, I knew them, they were numbered pieces of my puzzle, the concrete term of my \u2018plot\u2019.\u201dMrs. Touchett, her aunt, brings Isabel to Europe but is indifferent and unfeeling; Ralph is initially amused by her and helps her to inherit a fortune, only to guarantee her choices and the freedom to follow them (he probably is the only one that thoroughly loved Isabel); Madam Merle manages her meeting with Osmond and makes sure they end up married; Osmond thinks of her as one more item for his collection; Mr. Goodwood is persistent and never loses interest in her life (coming back again and again to see how she is), but seems to offer nothing more; Lord Warburton is a fair aristocratic friend to Isabel, but was he truly in love with her or merely looking for a trophy wife?; Henrietta Stackpole, is a true friend and probably an antithesis to Isabel; and Pansy, the artless creation of her husband, depends on Isabel as the only person who throughly loves her. So everyone, including the reader, look upon her, judge her decisions and contemplate as she takes each of her fateful steps into her destiny.Oh, there is much more about Isabel, and I hope I will be able to know her better once I am finished.2. The images and metaphors of Isabel Archer\u2019s lifeTo discuss this I first I want to tell you about a recurrent dream I had for a very long time. Sometimes, I dreamed that I was walking down the corridor on my home and discovered a door I had never realized existed; deciding to explore I would open it and it led me to a new, endless row of rooms, all grand with high windows and sunny, overlooking majestic gardens that I had never observed existed before. As I opened each door amazing new discoveries were revealed to me. My feelings were of exuberance, of happiness to have discovered so much beauty inside my home. But there was a variation to these recurrent dreams, or worst, there were also nightmares. In these I also discovered new places never visited before, however they would be dark and looked nowhere. As a result of this oppressive atmosphere I used to feel like I was in an endless prison inside my own home. I rejoiced in the first and feared to revisit those nightmares.So, when I started reading The Portrait of a Lady, it was fascinating to read how Henry James uses symbolic or metaphorical architectural spaces and places to tell us about Isabel Archer and her life. This was something I knew and it remitted directly to my dreams and my deepest self. \n\"Her imagination was by habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging.\"\nWe first meet Isabel at Gardencourt,\n\"Her uncle\u2019s house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. The large, low rooms, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a \u2018property\u2019\u2014...much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions\"\nBy marrying Osmond Isabel ends up enveloped in a palace dark and suffocating:\n\"She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of suffocation. Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air; Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her.\"\nThere, she seeks refuge or consolation on the ruins of Rome, for her a symbol of hope for despite their long sufferings they are still standing.\n\"She had long before this taken old Rome into her confidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places, so that as she sat in a sun-warmed angle on a winter\u2019s day, she could smile at it and think of its smallness.\"\nBut, ultimately, she seeks refuge once more at Gardencourt.\n\"All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desire too save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge. Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth in her strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place had been a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now.\"\n3. Isabel\u2019s choices and freedomIsabel's ability to choose, and the choices she makes are the thread that is carefully woven throughout the novel, and it raises her stature as a fictional heroine, in my opinion, to the level of that of an Anna Karenina or an Emma Bovary. For better or for worse. \n\"\u2018I\u2019m not bent on a life of misery,\u2019 said Isabel. \u2018I\u2019ve always been intensely determined to be happy, and I\u2019ve often believed I should be. I\u2019ve told people that. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself.\u2019\u2018By separating yourself from what?\u2019\u2018From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer.\u2019\"\nThe moment Isabel inherits starts the process whereupon she loses some of her freedom\u2026\n\"There\u2019s one remarkable clause in my husband\u2019s will,\u2019 Mrs Touchett added. \u2018He has left my niece a fortune.\u2019\u2018A fortune!\u2019 Madame Merle softly repeated.\u2018Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds.\u2019Madame Merle\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, still clasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, a little dilated... \u2018Ah,\u2019 she cried, \u2018the clever creature!\u2019\"\nAnd around Isabel there is always a sense of danger: \n\"\u2018I try to care more about the world than about myself\u2013\u2013but I always come back to myself. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 She stopped; her voice had trembled a little. \u2018Yes, I\u2019m afraid; I can\u2019t tell you. A large fortune means freedom, and I\u2019m afraid of that. It\u2019s such a fine thing, and one should make such a good use of it. If one shouldn\u2019t one would be ashamed... I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not a greater happiness to be powerless.\u2019\"\nBut was she really free or were her choices not as free as she dreamed? Or was it all inevitable to some degree? It seems that Isabel Archer's life was to some extend inescapable and this fact was not totally unknown to her. However, she thoroughly recongnizes how misguided she had been in her choice of husband. \n\"It was as if he had had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune. Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him? This mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life; a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered.\"\nSubsequentely, Isabel remains too proud to show it to the her friends. But despite all her efforts to conceal her misery, she cannot camouflage it from Ralph and Caspar: \n\"\u2018Watching her?\u2019\u2018Trying to make out if she's happy.\u2019\u2018That's easy to make out,\u2019 said Ralph. \u2018She\u2019s the most visibly happy woman I know.\u2019\u2018Exactly so; I\u2019m satisfied,\u2019 Goodwood answered dryly. For all his dryness, however, he had more to say. \u2018I\u2019ve been watching her. She pretends to be happy; that was what she undertook to be; and I thought I should like to see for myself what it amounts to. I\u2019ve seen,\u2019 he continued with a harsh ring in his voice, \u2018and I don\u2019t want to see any more. I\u2019m now quite ready to go.\u2019\"\nSorrowful and heartbroken, that's how this passage made me feel. But she is never to be pitied, she always stands upright despite doomed adversity. Yes, I suspect there is a sense of inevitability (what choices did she have, where her other suitors conductive of real happiness? I think not!) which could have made Isabel Archer\u2019s into a tragedy. But she is far from it, she still has choices. Nevertheless, James\u2019 work is not merely that. It is a reflection upon the ideal of a relative freedom and a play with its execution in a woman\u2019s life; the actions, its struggles and the consequent decisions taken by choice. This is what James has achieved with this work; that liberty is not only an ideal but a responsibility too. Though the reader may not approve of all her choices at the end, keeping in mind the betrayal of trust brought about by Madam Merle and Osmond, they were all freely taken or the result of her own will. A will which comes not merely from the limitations imposed by society, but by a newfound maturity, result of all her suffering, and above all from the vow to remain true to oneself. 4. Henry James gives the reader plenty of room to imagineThere\u2019s something about Henry James\u2019 work, and here in particular, that flares, tosses back and forth with unspoken frustration and desire. James\u2019 art, the one thing that makes him stand out for me, is in how he somehow implies, suggests, hints, but never outright tells the reader the ins and outs of his story. He even skips years, and it only adds to its enjoyment. If you want to live along with Isabel Archer, and I felt like I did, is to be conquered by infinite possibilities. Here we are not mere spectator or bystanders but may live everything along with her, if we want to. It is a hard reading that requires effort, but if we invest in it we can grasp the possibilities the whole world that exists beneath the surface of his work.5. Her ultimate choiceIsabel falls for Gilbert Osmond, to my mind, partly because he does not mindlessly adore her, does not fawn over her. He takes his time in the courtship, he (with the help of Madame Merle) has a clear strategy and it works. He is mysterious, indolent; and there is the hint of a darker side. He appears to be tired of everything, simply bored, so Isabel feels like for once she is helping somebody. That her inheritance has a meaning, a destiny. She seems to feel recompensated and fulfilled.\n\"...\u2018What has he ever done?\u2019 he added abruptly.\u2018That I should marry him? Nothing at all,\u2019 Isabel replied while her patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. \u2018If he had done great things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr Goodwood; I\u2019m marrying a perfect nonentity. Don\u2019t try to take an interest in him. You can\u2019t.\u2019\"\nAnd we are not the only ones to be surprised by her choice to marry Gilbert Osmond. Ralph was appalled:\n\"\u2018I think I\u2019ve hardly got over my surprise,\u2019 he went on at last. \u2018You were the last person I expected to see caught.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know why you call it caught.\u2019\u2018Because you\u2019re going to be put into a cage.\u2019\u2018If I like my cage, that needn\u2019t trouble you,\u2019 she answered....\u2018You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.\u2019\"\nBut she still has another choice ahead of her. Her ultimate choice is whether or not to return to Osmond after she goes to Gardencourt to visit her dying cousin. Again Henry James gifts us with a superb image that could not translate better the pervading dread of what she is about to do:\n\"There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started.\"\nAnd at last we understand her ultimate decision, although such resolution is not easily reached. \n\"There were lights in the windows of the house; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time\u2014for the distance was considerable\u2014she had moved through the darkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then she put her hand on the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a very straight path.\"\nIn the end I recognized a worthier and more mature Isabel Archer, and I think that she comes out of her sufferings stronger. I would like to imagine Osmond would be surprised by her when she gets back to Rome, and that she would be able to change her standing. Their roles perhaps altered. Although there should certainly be more anguish ahead of her, given what she is going back to, I imagine there is always the possibility of happiness.______"], ["I've been reading a lot of Anthony Trollope's books recently and the stories, characters and writing is so much superior to this that I just can't get into it. \"Frothy\" is a word that comes to mind, also \"was he paid by the word?\" like Dickens. I finished the book, finally. It was a chore. I did not find James' portrayal of a woman's personality convincing. That even though she had the financial power which was the reason why her husband had married her, she would still allow herself to be physically and emotionally abused and humiliated. It seemed to be a very conventional view of a woman, that eventually she would give in to her Lord and Master. A woman with an ounce of independence (she did have an ounce, maybe even two) at the beginning would not be the sad creature she was at the end. Marriages were made in light of money and status in those times, in this book, she had both, he had neither, there had to be some sort of mental shift that that would allow her to pretend that these were her husband's and she was in the lower and grateful position. But James didn't write it, so 'Portrait' really didn't make sense.None of the characters, evil, good or milk-water gained my sympathy. Pansy, the daughter, nearly did, but I wanted to shake her and say 'how could you have lived all these years and not suspected who your mother is? Your father has palmed you off on the nuns all these years, what's with this unquestioning obedience? Its your step-mother has the money, not him, she's the one who can help you, would help you,not your daddy who just wants you to achieve his own social-climbing ambitions'. I just don't see James as a man who understood women enough to write about them from any but a man's perspective.I watched the Nichole Kidman film of the book and although Kidman did her best to flesh out the character she was no more rounded than in the book. And Poppy's submissiveness and ignorance were even more unbelievable. Obviously, to James, the main characteristic he associated with women and interpreted thusly by the director, was submissiveness.Henry James may have deserved his reputation as a Grand Old Man of (American) letters, but not through this book, it just didn't do it for me."], ["I had many wonderful moments while reading this book, moments when the writing halted the reading, when I had to pause and admire and wonder. Moments when the book seemed to speak to my own experience as if it were written expressly for the girl who was me at twenty-two, causing me to wonder how Henry James could have guessed so well the presumptuous ideas I had about life and love at that early stage. All of that is very personal, of course, and not necessarily of interest to other readers, but there were other moments in my reading of The Portrait of a Lady that better merit mention in a review. I had read this book before, about twenty years ago, so although I knew the bare bones of the story, I remembered few of the details. I certainly had no recollection of the early scene in which Isabel Archer walks in on an unknown guest in her aunt\u2019s house. And yet there was something about the lead-up to that scene that caught my attention this time: the house is very still because Isabel\u2019s uncle is dying. Out of the silence comes the sound of someone playing the piano. Wonderingly, Isabel makes her way toward the source of the harmony. Those six words were like a bell ringing in my mind. I felt a sharpening of interest, an awareness of how pivotal this moment would be in the story. I remember thinking: I've been reading this book with all senses on alert and this is my reward; I've sensed the author\u2019s excitement at the turn his story is about to take. There was another scene later in the book when I had a similar feeling of change about to happen: Isabel sits up late one night in Rome pondering a difficult decision, indeed pondering all the decisions in her life so far. The reader watches with her and wonders how she will act. And wonders again when she finally does.There are other major shifts in the narrative but none stood out for me quite the way those two did. In fact, Henry James purposely avoids describing the most significant shift of all, skipping a three-year section of Isabel\u2019s life completely - which is a very effective narrative device of course, introducing both surprise and suspense in a story that has only a six-year span in total. As a reader I appreciated both strategies: the emphasis he seemed to place on some scenes and the complete omission he allowed to others. It was all very wonderful. In fact this book has revised my idea of what \u2018wonderful\u2019 means. 'The Portrait of a Lady' is vying for a place as the highlight of my Henry James reading year even though The Ambassadors was already firmly camped in that position. I've decided they can be the joint highlight - they have a lot of wonderfulness in common.When I finished 'The Portrait', I turned to HJ\u2019s 1906 appendix and found a paragraph about his concerns for the reader. He writes that he has purposely piled brick upon brick for our benefit, carefully including the details that will enable us to grasp the totality of his creation. And among those details, he mentions two in particular, keystones in the building of the story as it were. The first is the piano scene I described earlier. He speaks of the rare chemistry of that scene in which Isabel recognizes that a huge change is about to happen in her life. I felt really validated as a reader to have been aware in advance of the significance of what I was about to read, and so I wasn't surprised when his other pivotal scene turned out to be the one where Isabel sits up late into the Roman night, pondering her decisions. This is the sixteenth Henry James book I've read in six months. Perhaps I've learnt something of the way his writer\u2019s mind works!More confirmation of that possibility came when he began to discuss the shape of this novel. He continues to speak in terms of bricks and architecture and proportions, and he says that of all his novels, 'The Portrait' is the best proportioned with the exception of a novel he was to write twenty-two years later: The Ambassadors. Alongside a certain \u2018roundness\u2019 in shape which they share, he finds they also share a kind of supporting beam or rib that runs through them. This rib is made from two minor but key characters, Henrietta Stackpole and Maria Gostrey. Both seem extraneous to each story at first glance yet both are central to the architecture of their particular story. I remember noting that Maria Gostrey was the thread that allowed me to find my way through the labyrinth that was 'The Ambassadors' so it was wonderful to hear Henry James confirm that, and underline the links between the two books as well. I was also reminded that I had begun to look at his books in terms of architecture while reading The Wings of the Dove, so I really appreciated his architectural metaphors.In fact the appendix left me amazed and wondering at every turn. In the updates, I quoted part of a paragraph on his theories about the \u2018house of fiction\u2019. I'd like to quote the whole thing here because it is really worth reading - and it provided me with huge insights into some Gerald Murnane books I've puzzled over in the past, The Plains and Inland, and offered a strong desire to read his Million Windows:The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million - a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbors are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; \u201cfortunately\u201d by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the \u201cchoice of subject\u201d; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the \u201cliterary form\u201d; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his \u201cmoral\u201d reference.\u2026\u2026\u2026This book is the final one in my 2017 Henry James season and I can't think of a better title to finish on. But in every ending there are beginnings - 'The Portrait' has led me to another book: Henry James says he took the slight \u2018personality\u2019, the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl and created what he called \u2018an ado about Isabel Archer\u2019. That reference has prompted me to go back to Shakespeare and read Much Ado About Nothing. I do love when one book leads to another!"], ["Ugh, ech, the elitism that breeds in readers! We think we're such nicey cosy bookworms and wouldn't harm a fly but we seethe, we do. Of course, readers of books just naturally look down on those who don't read at all. In fact they try not to think of those people (nine tenths of the human race I suppose, but a tenth of the human race is still a big number) because it makes them shudder. (How lovely it would be to go riding in a carriage through some dreadful council estate flinging free copies of Ulysses and Mrs Dalloway right and left (although Ulysses might catch some of those urchins a hefty blow on the temple (which might cause a shift in their brain landscape and evoke a sudden craving for modernist novels, like when people are struck by a bus and wake up talking in a French accent, that can happen))). So that's one obvious kind of reader elitism. But then, some readers think that what the majority of readers actually read is appalling (Hungervinciboneskitehelpslappery Twilit Shades of Pottery doo dah). It's not that you read, it's what you read. Of course. And then, amongst those elevated readers, some literary authors are considered greater than some others (why are you wasting your time with William Gaddis when you could be knee-deep in Proust, dwarling? I simply don't understand it). And then, even when you scale the heights and find yourself munching down some Henry James like he was the last well-done steak (with Chateau Lafleur) you were going to get before your solo trek (no huskies) to the south pole, you still get it - oh dwarling, why are you still dillydallying in the Middle Period when you still haven't read The Golden Bowl you naughty Jamesian you!Thus it is that I say - oh no, not The Portrait of a Lady. Too too obvious. Try The Awkward Age or The Ambassadors. Much better."], ["Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady is considered to be one of the first American novels to make full use of social and psychological realism as European authors - such as Flaubert, Balzac and George Eliot - were already practicing in their works. Considered to be his biggest accomplishment along with The Ambassadors, Portrait added Isabel Archer to the company of great fictional heroines - as the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, Becky Sharp and Jane Eyre - and, in a century marked by unsatisfied bourgeois wives and adultery in fiction - Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina come to mind -, it was a breath of fresh air to accompany and delve into James' protagonist's thoughts and inner feelings.Starting with a very slow pace, the narrative contains long and elaborate descriptions. It feels James is painting a richly detailed picture for every scene. As we arrive in Gardencourt - the Touchett's English country estate where our story opens and closes -, we encounter Mr. Touchett, his son Ralph and a family friend called Lord Warburton. Among other things, they discuss how Mrs. Lydia Touchett is in America and will bring along her niece called Isabel Archer to visit Europe.Isabel is a young woman, from Albany, New York, who accepts her aunt's offer to initially stay with her in Gardencourt and then later travel through the continent, eager to explore and be enriched by the places she's never been before and experience life at its fullest. Upon her arrival, we begin to learn what her ideals and plans are, along with her hopes and dreams.Since the beginning, her cousin Ralph seems to have been as curious as we were to see what Isabel would make of her life. In a way, we almost could say Ralph was conducting an experiment: Isabel had an independent mind, she was emotionally and psychologically self-sufficient - didn't seem inclined to get married for the time being, which was different for a girl of her age at the time. She was thirsty for knowledge first and foremost: \u201cI don\u2019t want to begin life by marrying\u201d, Isabel asserts to Ralph. \u201cThere are other things a woman can do.\" But without money, how far could she go with her unattached ways? She was probably bound to eventually getting married. Her cousin, then, arranged it and she became financially independent as well. Certain that he was doing Isabel a good deed, Ralph convinced his father - who was very fond of Isabel - at his deathbed to leave her an impressive amount of money. Now she had all that was necessary to decide her destiny without any barriers or anyone to hold her back. The experiment was on.After traveling for over a year, the now wealthy Isabel Archer is in Florence, where her aunt lives. A friend she greatly admired, Madame Merle - Mrs. Touchett's close friend who Isabel got acquainted with some time after she arrived in Gardencourt - skillfully introduces her to Gilbert Osmond: an American expatriate widower who's lived in Italy for years. Isabel is very impressed with his refinement and intelligence and thinks of him as having a beautiful mind. Despite her family and friends complaints about this relationship, Isabel - after having declined two previous suitors - accepts Osmond's marriage proposal.The story then jumps in time and there's a narrative shift: for a bit, James leaves Isabel and Osmond in the background while he focuses on Pansy Osmond - Osmond's young daughter - and Edward Rosier - Isabel's childhood friend who's in love with Miss Osmond and is trying to get Madame Merle to help him marry his darling girl. Through their story, we still have glimpses of Isabel's life and we learn that she's been now married for two years and that she lost a son who died six months after his birth. Isabel and her husband seems to disagree about everything and we learn she's unhappy.Henry James, who once conducted a very slow paced - almost contemplative - narrative, gradually started to accelerate it, adding drama and a sense of urgency to his words. Right after an unsettling argument with Osmond one evening, Isabel, now feeling more distraught than ever, starts pondering and analyzing the many circumstances she finds herself in. The author immerses us in a deeply personal and intensely psychological account of her thoughts and emotions. Among the things Isabel reflected upon for a long time were the conclusion that her husband must hate her and the realization that Osmond had gained total control of her - the once independent and strong witted woman was now a subjugated spirit; the woman who once seemed to be against doing what was expected of her was now conforming to her husband's decisions. \"When the clock struck four she got up; she was going to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets.\"Complicating things even further is the revelation Countess Gemini - Osmond's sister - makes to Isabel of a long time secret, that leaves her completely shaken. This only comes to deteriorate even more her relationship with Gilbert. Now, fully aware of the situation she was put in through manipulations and schemes, Isabel is faced with a big decision: her cousin Ralph is dying in Gardencourt and her dictatorial husband is completely against her visiting England. Showing the old Isabel may still be somewhere locked inside of herself, she confronts her husband and leaves to be with her cousin.The Portrait of a Lady, through its length, presents a number of opposites, but the most striking ones are the battles between freedom vs. destiny and affection vs. betrayal. In the book's final moments, we witness that Isabel is offered a way to go back to where and to whom she was when she first came to Europe: \"The world's all before us - and the world's very big\", she is told. She could once again explore life and fill herself with hopes - but declined the opportunity: \"The world's very small\", she answered. With a much talked about conclusion that has both fascinated and infuriated - another battle of opposites? - readers, James' ending remains open to a lot of interpretations.It's disturbing to watch an unhappily married woman with an opportunity to leave it all behind - and the means to do it - simply not choosing freedom. Did Osmond finally accomplish to shatter her spirit? Another theory is that maybe marriage was an unbreakable vow and she felt she had a moral duty to her husband. Or was she trying to be protective of Pansy - who was mirroring Isabel's unhappiness and was another example of a woman who seemed to think that she was obliged to follow other's decisions even if it made her unhappy - and determined to stand by her side and not let the same happen to her step daughter? Innumerable possibilities...James has been known for structuring his novels with a series of circles surrounding a center. With that in mind, a hopeful interpretation of the book's ending is that, in order to complete that circle, Isabel must return to her husband, properly end her marriage so she could once again be able to start anew and free her spirit once and for all.Rating: for such an interesting and comprehensive analysis of freedom, human consciousness and ultimately, existentialism: 4 stars."], ["Book Review\n\n3+ out of 5 stars for The Portrait of a Lady, a classic story called the \"Great American Novel,\" written by Henry James in 1881. I adore Henry James and found great enjoyment in his literary works when I began reading him in my freshmen year at college. As an English major, I was exposed to many different authors, but I felt a strong connection with him and this literary period. American realistic works spoke to me above any of the other \"classic\" books I had been reading. As a result, I chose Henry James as the primary focus of an independent study course I'd taken in my senior year. I read 6 or 7 of his books during those 3 months and am going back now to provide quick reviews, as not everyone finds him as enjoyable as I do. I also don't want to bore everyone with a lengthy review on how to interpret him or his books.The Portrait of a Lady tells the story of a young woman who years to have her own life and make her own mark on the world. She doesn't want to be contained by marriage or the structure in place at the time in the late 19th century. She has different characteristics coming from American, English and continental European female archetypes. She has strong moral and ethical values. She knows who she is, yet she does not know all. As she moves through life, she makes choices that are not easy for her to execute. What I loved about this work is its deep exploratory view points, beautiful language and unparalleled characters. Though I only give it a 3, when compared to some of this other works, I would recommend you read a few chapters or sections, just to see if it is something you could find yourself getting lost in.The impact you feel upon reading this book is questioning what is the true view of a lady, how is she different from generation to generate, location to location and societal class to societal class. James knows women. He is very accurate on many levels... wrong on a few, too. But to put out his thoughts, in a huge tome, at a time when women were beginning to get more rights... and be able to cross genres and genders... is amazing. It's less about what he says and more about how he says it. And that's why I enjoy reading him... but even I admit, I can only take 1 book every few years! :)\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Isabel Archer is a young American lady, for whom the novel is titled, who is adventurous and very independent. She turns down two marriage proposals in the 1st half of the book to preserve her independence, one from Casper Goodwood, a young wealthy American, and one from Lord Warburton, a wealthy English aristocrat. When her English uncle dies, she inherits a large sum of money and travels with her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, to her Italian villa where she eventually meets, falls in love with, and marries Gilbert Osmond. All of her family and friends try to dissuade her from this, but to no avail, and she finally learns that Osmond doesn't love her, married her for her money, and to own her as another of his possessions. Obviously there is a lot more intrigue to the story and the enjoyment for me came from the wonderful writing of James."], ["Exquisite, cozy, at times funny, at times sad, and unforgettable. I won\u2019t bore readers with another summary of the story; they\u2019re abundant on this site. I will say that with Isabel Archer, James earns his place in the canon with a proto-feminist (yes, I said it, proto-feminist) novel of a remarkable, if hard to describe heroine, who is faithful to her idea(l)s, rejects the affections of strong (but good) men, and suffers unnecessarily at the hands of a Machiavellian cad and an equally manipulative woman. If you don\u2019t like long novels\u2014avoid this one like a plague. If you don\u2019t like novels written in style from another era, get thee hence! If wordy, complicated sentences are anathema to you, you\u2019ve probably already stopped reading this mini-review.If I were to advise a reader at all, I\u2019d suggest reading it in as short a period as you can. Bite the bullet, finish it off keeping as much in mind as you can. I\u2019d also advise reading it on a Kindle (for the built-in dictionary) or, at the very least, keep a dictionary at hand. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have; and if you don\u2019t\u2014if you read the wrong book for you (this one), please, please, don\u2019t say James is an idiot (or some equivalent) or that the book is just boring (or some equivalent)\u2014instead, face the fact, you read the wrong book."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "The Portrait of a Lady is arguably Henry James' most appealing and accessible novel.

You are already zapped of energy. You feel like going to a bar and have a couple of beer listening to a funky live band or the crooning of a lovely young lady. Or you want to go to a nearby mall and sit in the comfort of a dark movie house. Probably sleep to rest for a couple of hours if the movie turns out to be boring.But you decide to go as you planned at the start of the day. Your gym bag is in your car. You drag your heavy feet to the parking lot. To the gym. You know you have to do it your friend has been telling you that Henry James is good but you imagine the taste of cold beer quenching your thirst or the soft seat inside the theater or the pretty songbird wearing a plunging neckline or showing her slim smooth legs there are quick reads waiting for you like Ray Bradbury\u2019s Farenheit 451 or that Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes. But you know your body needs exercise. You are becoming fatter, heavier and your waistline is expanding. You resisted the quick but empty lure of beer or sleep at the movie house. Your heart is telling you that Henry James is an author to read. Like a zombie, you continued sleepwalking to the gym.After changing to your gym attire. You step on the treadmill. The solitude of working out. In the gym, you rarely talk to anyone. Henry James used a style that was distinctively his: wordy yet illuminating You are by yourself. Most of your friends don\u2019t care about Henry James. You begin to walk. Warm up. After a couple of minutes, you increase the speed. Chug. Chug. Chug. It goes on and on. His storytelling went on and on. His characters came from New York, to England, went to Paris, then to Rome and then went back to England and finally went back to Rome. After the treadmill, you lift some weights as you also need to tone some muscles. His characters were varied. There was Isabel Archer fighting for her independence by refusing marriage proposals like there was not tomorrow but in the end she found with the wrong man: conceited, two-timer, treacherous and condescending. Some muscles are not supposed to be exercised right after a neighboring one. They could be contradicting each other and not only you will not get the maximum benefit from your workout but you are in the danger of having an injury like some pulled muscles. Isabel\u2019s cousin Ralph Touchett is the \u201cconscience\u201d of the novel, telling by instinct whether the person-character is good or bad. He is sick but he is the only character that has the purest heart.You came to the gym gloomy and dragged your feet as you did not have the energy even to go up a couple of stairs. Some people agonize reading this kind of 19th century Victorian English But when you came out to go back to your car, you felt energized and refreshed. You felt triumphant that Isabel Archer was going back to Rome for Pansy not necessarily for Oswald. But she decided whatever her heart was telling her. In the end, it was all that mattered: independence. She followed her heart: a personal triumph.  In the end, you did not regret going to the gym. In the end, I am happy I read a Henry James."], ["10 Things I Love About Henry James\u2019s The Portrait Of A Lady1. Isabel ArcherThe \u201clady\u201d in the title. Beautiful, young, headstrong and spirited, the American woman visits her wealthy relatives in England, rejects marriage proposals by two worthy suitors, inherits a fortune and then is manipulated into marrying one of the most odious creatures on the planet, Gilbert Osmond. She\u2019s utterly fascinating, and if I were back in university, I imagine having long conversations and arguments about her character. What does she want: Freedom? The ability to choose, even if it\u2019s a bad choice? Is she a projection of James\u2019s latent homosexuality? Is she a feminist or not? There are no simple answers. 2. The Prose and Psychological ComplexityDamn, James knew how to write long, luxuriant sentences that dig deep into his characters\u2019 minds. Sometimes the effect can be claustrophobic \u2013 get me out of this person\u2019s head! \u2013 but more often it\u2019s utterly compelling and convincing. We partly read fiction to learn about other people\u2019s lives, right? Well, James does that. (The exceptions: Isabel\u2019s two wealthy, handsome suitors, Warburton and Goodwood, are less than believable, and remind me of eager (or horny?) dogs, their tails wagging whenever they\u2019re around their love/lust object.)3. The StoryOkay, not much really happens. But as the book progressed, even though I sort of knew the outcome (it\u2019s hard to avoid spoilers from a 135-year-old classic), I was increasingly curious to see how Isabel would act. In fact, I raced through the final chapters, breathlessly. Who knew: Henry James, page-turner! And have a theory about that ending? Take your turn...4. The HumourIt\u2019s not a comedy, but there are lots of amusing bits. James\u2019s narrator is genial and funny. Henrietta Stackpole, her gentleman friend, Mr. Bantling, and even Gilbert Osmond\u2019s sister, the Countess Gemini, are all very colourful characters who elicit a chuckle or two. And Isabel\u2019s aunt can be terribly cutting as well. I love Ralph (Isabel's cousin) and the dignified British Lord Warburton\u2019s reactions to the enterprising, no-fuss American \u201clady journalist\u201d Henrietta. 5. The SettingsEach one is significant: from the stately Gardencourt, home of Isabel\u2019s relatives the Touchetts, to the bustle and anonymity of London, to the ruins of Rome, where Isabel finds herself stuck in a dead, fossilized marriage. James is a master at finding the right place to stage a scene. I could write an essay about interiors and exteriors in the book, but I\u2019ll spare you.6. The VillainsMadame Merle and Gilbert Osmond: individually they\u2019re sinister, but together they\u2019re positively Machiavellian. In fact, in one scene, it\u2019s revealed that they both like Machiavelli, and Isabel doesn\u2019t get the clue! They totally play her. And yet they\u2019re believable, too. Osmond\u2019s scene in which he professes his love is brilliant in its manipulation; and the final turn of the screw (asking her to do him a favour!) is very clever. Madame Merle\u2019s motivations always keep you guessing. Does she see herself in Isabel? Is she jealous? Does she just want to exert her power over her? The scene in which Isabel sees both in her home, conspiring (evident from their attitudes) is so powerful James refers to it a couple of times. And of course, it\u2019s missing from the Jane Campion film (see below).7. The ThemesDoes money corrupt? What do you really know about someone before you marry? What is the true nature of freedom? What happens when New World (American) \"innocence\" meets Old World (European) \"experience\"? All these themes \u2013 and many others \u2013 come across naturally, and never feel shoe-horned into the story.8. The TechniqueI remember hearing people go on about the architecture of Henry James\u2019s novels, and this one is sturdily, handsomely built. The book begins and ends in the same setting. And there are some ingenious sections in the middle, where time has passed and the reader discovers major information through conversations. Like any great writer, James knows what to leave out. He makes you do work to fill in the pieces, but the novel becomes more memorable because of that. And he bridges the Victorian and Modern eras, in the same way that Beethoven bridges the Classical and Romantic eras.9. Chapter 42After a huge blowup with Osmond, Isabel stays up all night, staring into the fireplace, and ponders her life, thinking: \"How did I get here?\" James considered it one of the best things he\u2019d ever written, and although I haven\u2019t read a lot of his work (which I will soon remedy), I\u2019d have to agree. It\u2019s right up there with Hamlet\u2019s soliloquies.10. The Fact that the Book Doesn't Lend Itself Well To Adaptation A couple days after finishing the book, I watched the Campion film starring Nicole Kidman. Besides an evocative score and a brilliant performance by Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle and a suitably slimy one by John Malkovich (basically changing costumes from his Dangerous Liaisons character), it was dreadfully dull. There have been other James adaptations \u2013 The Wings Of The Dove, The Golden Bowl, The Bostonians \u2013 but none of these films has achieved the critical or popular success of an Age Of Innocence, Howards End or Room With A View. Maybe it's hard to get that psychological complexity onscreen? Read the books.***Conclusion: James is The Master. Up til now, I\u2019d only read his shorter works, like the novellas \u201cThe Turn Of The Screw,\u201d \u201cDaisy Miller\u201d (I still don\u2019t quite know what killed her - sorry if that\u2019s a spoiler) and \u201cThe Beast In The Jungle.\u201d Now I\u2019m eyeing his other major novels; perhaps I\u2019ll even get through the notoriously difficult late period James. Can't wait to try!"], ["For my dear friend Jeffrey Keeten: I would not have read it if it were not for you. Thanks! Henry James\u2019 The Portrait of a Lady touched me deeply. Since I finished this novel a few days ago, I could not seem to stop thinking about it as I tried to organize my feelings. That I was mesmerized by it, there is no doubt. So much that the search for its understanding has occupied practically all my free moments. And to fully grasp it I could not do without Henry James masterful help, so forgive me if you find I quote him too often. Oh, but this is a work in progress, so forgive me again for any inaccuracy or inconsistency. 1. The complexity of Isabel Archer\n\"Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The novel is of its very nature an ado, an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for\u2014for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.\"\nPortrait of a Lady is the story of a young American woman, Isabel Archer, and her voyage of self-discovery. I loved getting into Isabel's conflicted mind, her doubts and her confidence, her wishes and her choices. I went even further and identified thoroughly with Isabel Archer. I could relate to her conflicted mind, her dreams and ultimate choices. She was a pleasure to know, because she is so extraordinarily complex, complex in a way that fictional people seldom are.From the first we learn how Isabel valued her freedom, in a dialogue with her cousin Ralph:\n\"\u2018Adopted me?\u2019 The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain...\u2018Oh no; she has not adopted me. I\u2019m not a candidate for adoption.\u2019\u2018I beg a thousand pardons,\u2019 Ralph murmured. \u2018I meant... \u2018You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up... but,\u2019 she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, \u2018I\u2019m very fond of my liberty.\u2019\"\nThe secondary characters are there to explain Isabel Archer, as Henry James tells us \u201cthey are there, for what they are worth\u2026 the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer\u2019s history. I recognized them, I knew them, they were numbered pieces of my puzzle, the concrete term of my \u2018plot\u2019.\u201dMrs. Touchett, her aunt, brings Isabel to Europe but is indifferent and unfeeling; Ralph is initially amused by her and helps her to inherit a fortune, only to guarantee her choices and the freedom to follow them (he probably is the only one that thoroughly loved Isabel); Madam Merle manages her meeting with Osmond and makes sure they end up married; Osmond thinks of her as one more item for his collection; Mr. Goodwood is persistent and never loses interest in her life (coming back again and again to see how she is), but seems to offer nothing more; Lord Warburton is a fair aristocratic friend to Isabel, but was he truly in love with her or merely looking for a trophy wife?; Henrietta Stackpole, is a true friend and probably an antithesis to Isabel; and Pansy, the artless creation of her husband, depends on Isabel as the only person who throughly loves her. So everyone, including the reader, look upon her, judge her decisions and contemplate as she takes each of her fateful steps into her destiny.Oh, there is much more about Isabel, and I hope I will be able to know her better once I am finished.2. The images and metaphors of Isabel Archer\u2019s lifeTo discuss this I first I want to tell you about a recurrent dream I had for a very long time. Sometimes, I dreamed that I was walking down the corridor on my home and discovered a door I had never realized existed; deciding to explore I would open it and it led me to a new, endless row of rooms, all grand with high windows and sunny, overlooking majestic gardens that I had never observed existed before. As I opened each door amazing new discoveries were revealed to me. My feelings were of exuberance, of happiness to have discovered so much beauty inside my home. But there was a variation to these recurrent dreams, or worst, there were also nightmares. In these I also discovered new places never visited before, however they would be dark and looked nowhere. As a result of this oppressive atmosphere I used to feel like I was in an endless prison inside my own home. I rejoiced in the first and feared to revisit those nightmares.So, when I started reading The Portrait of a Lady, it was fascinating to read how Henry James uses symbolic or metaphorical architectural spaces and places to tell us about Isabel Archer and her life. This was something I knew and it remitted directly to my dreams and my deepest self. \n\"Her imagination was by habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging.\"\nWe first meet Isabel at Gardencourt,\n\"Her uncle\u2019s house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. The large, low rooms, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a \u2018property\u2019\u2014...much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions\"\nBy marrying Osmond Isabel ends up enveloped in a palace dark and suffocating:\n\"She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of suffocation. Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air; Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her.\"\nThere, she seeks refuge or consolation on the ruins of Rome, for her a symbol of hope for despite their long sufferings they are still standing.\n\"She had long before this taken old Rome into her confidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places, so that as she sat in a sun-warmed angle on a winter\u2019s day, she could smile at it and think of its smallness.\"\nBut, ultimately, she seeks refuge once more at Gardencourt.\n\"All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desire too save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge. Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth in her strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place had been a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now.\"\n3. Isabel\u2019s choices and freedomIsabel's ability to choose, and the choices she makes are the thread that is carefully woven throughout the novel, and it raises her stature as a fictional heroine, in my opinion, to the level of that of an Anna Karenina or an Emma Bovary. For better or for worse. \n\"\u2018I\u2019m not bent on a life of misery,\u2019 said Isabel. \u2018I\u2019ve always been intensely determined to be happy, and I\u2019ve often believed I should be. I\u2019ve told people that. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself.\u2019\u2018By separating yourself from what?\u2019\u2018From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer.\u2019\"\nThe moment Isabel inherits starts the process whereupon she loses some of her freedom\u2026\n\"There\u2019s one remarkable clause in my husband\u2019s will,\u2019 Mrs Touchett added. \u2018He has left my niece a fortune.\u2019\u2018A fortune!\u2019 Madame Merle softly repeated.\u2018Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds.\u2019Madame Merle\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, still clasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, a little dilated... \u2018Ah,\u2019 she cried, \u2018the clever creature!\u2019\"\nAnd around Isabel there is always a sense of danger: \n\"\u2018I try to care more about the world than about myself\u2013\u2013but I always come back to myself. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 She stopped; her voice had trembled a little. \u2018Yes, I\u2019m afraid; I can\u2019t tell you. A large fortune means freedom, and I\u2019m afraid of that. It\u2019s such a fine thing, and one should make such a good use of it. If one shouldn\u2019t one would be ashamed... I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not a greater happiness to be powerless.\u2019\"\nBut was she really free or were her choices not as free as she dreamed? Or was it all inevitable to some degree? It seems that Isabel Archer's life was to some extend inescapable and this fact was not totally unknown to her. However, she thoroughly recongnizes how misguided she had been in her choice of husband. \n\"It was as if he had had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune. Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him? This mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life; a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered.\"\nSubsequentely, Isabel remains too proud to show it to the her friends. But despite all her efforts to conceal her misery, she cannot camouflage it from Ralph and Caspar: \n\"\u2018Watching her?\u2019\u2018Trying to make out if she's happy.\u2019\u2018That's easy to make out,\u2019 said Ralph. \u2018She\u2019s the most visibly happy woman I know.\u2019\u2018Exactly so; I\u2019m satisfied,\u2019 Goodwood answered dryly. For all his dryness, however, he had more to say. \u2018I\u2019ve been watching her. She pretends to be happy; that was what she undertook to be; and I thought I should like to see for myself what it amounts to. I\u2019ve seen,\u2019 he continued with a harsh ring in his voice, \u2018and I don\u2019t want to see any more. I\u2019m now quite ready to go.\u2019\"\nSorrowful and heartbroken, that's how this passage made me feel. But she is never to be pitied, she always stands upright despite doomed adversity. Yes, I suspect there is a sense of inevitability (what choices did she have, where her other suitors conductive of real happiness? I think not!) which could have made Isabel Archer\u2019s into a tragedy. But she is far from it, she still has choices. Nevertheless, James\u2019 work is not merely that. It is a reflection upon the ideal of a relative freedom and a play with its execution in a woman\u2019s life; the actions, its struggles and the consequent decisions taken by choice. This is what James has achieved with this work; that liberty is not only an ideal but a responsibility too. Though the reader may not approve of all her choices at the end, keeping in mind the betrayal of trust brought about by Madam Merle and Osmond, they were all freely taken or the result of her own will. A will which comes not merely from the limitations imposed by society, but by a newfound maturity, result of all her suffering, and above all from the vow to remain true to oneself. 4. Henry James gives the reader plenty of room to imagineThere\u2019s something about Henry James\u2019 work, and here in particular, that flares, tosses back and forth with unspoken frustration and desire. James\u2019 art, the one thing that makes him stand out for me, is in how he somehow implies, suggests, hints, but never outright tells the reader the ins and outs of his story. He even skips years, and it only adds to its enjoyment. If you want to live along with Isabel Archer, and I felt like I did, is to be conquered by infinite possibilities. Here we are not mere spectator or bystanders but may live everything along with her, if we want to. It is a hard reading that requires effort, but if we invest in it we can grasp the possibilities the whole world that exists beneath the surface of his work.5. Her ultimate choiceIsabel falls for Gilbert Osmond, to my mind, partly because he does not mindlessly adore her, does not fawn over her. He takes his time in the courtship, he (with the help of Madame Merle) has a clear strategy and it works. He is mysterious, indolent; and there is the hint of a darker side. He appears to be tired of everything, simply bored, so Isabel feels like for once she is helping somebody. That her inheritance has a meaning, a destiny. She seems to feel recompensated and fulfilled.\n\"...\u2018What has he ever done?\u2019 he added abruptly.\u2018That I should marry him? Nothing at all,\u2019 Isabel replied while her patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. \u2018If he had done great things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr Goodwood; I\u2019m marrying a perfect nonentity. Don\u2019t try to take an interest in him. You can\u2019t.\u2019\"\nAnd we are not the only ones to be surprised by her choice to marry Gilbert Osmond. Ralph was appalled:\n\"\u2018I think I\u2019ve hardly got over my surprise,\u2019 he went on at last. \u2018You were the last person I expected to see caught.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know why you call it caught.\u2019\u2018Because you\u2019re going to be put into a cage.\u2019\u2018If I like my cage, that needn\u2019t trouble you,\u2019 she answered....\u2018You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.\u2019\"\nBut she still has another choice ahead of her. Her ultimate choice is whether or not to return to Osmond after she goes to Gardencourt to visit her dying cousin. Again Henry James gifts us with a superb image that could not translate better the pervading dread of what she is about to do:\n\"There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started.\"\nAnd at last we understand her ultimate decision, although such resolution is not easily reached. \n\"There were lights in the windows of the house; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time\u2014for the distance was considerable\u2014she had moved through the darkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then she put her hand on the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a very straight path.\"\nIn the end I recognized a worthier and more mature Isabel Archer, and I think that she comes out of her sufferings stronger. I would like to imagine Osmond would be surprised by her when she gets back to Rome, and that she would be able to change her standing. Their roles perhaps altered. Although there should certainly be more anguish ahead of her, given what she is going back to, I imagine there is always the possibility of happiness.______"], ["I've been reading a lot of Anthony Trollope's books recently and the stories, characters and writing is so much superior to this that I just can't get into it. \"Frothy\" is a word that comes to mind, also \"was he paid by the word?\" like Dickens. I finished the book, finally. It was a chore. I did not find James' portrayal of a woman's personality convincing. That even though she had the financial power which was the reason why her husband had married her, she would still allow herself to be physically and emotionally abused and humiliated. It seemed to be a very conventional view of a woman, that eventually she would give in to her Lord and Master. A woman with an ounce of independence (she did have an ounce, maybe even two) at the beginning would not be the sad creature she was at the end. Marriages were made in light of money and status in those times, in this book, she had both, he had neither, there had to be some sort of mental shift that that would allow her to pretend that these were her husband's and she was in the lower and grateful position. But James didn't write it, so 'Portrait' really didn't make sense.None of the characters, evil, good or milk-water gained my sympathy. Pansy, the daughter, nearly did, but I wanted to shake her and say 'how could you have lived all these years and not suspected who your mother is? Your father has palmed you off on the nuns all these years, what's with this unquestioning obedience? Its your step-mother has the money, not him, she's the one who can help you, would help you,not your daddy who just wants you to achieve his own social-climbing ambitions'. I just don't see James as a man who understood women enough to write about them from any but a man's perspective.I watched the Nichole Kidman film of the book and although Kidman did her best to flesh out the character she was no more rounded than in the book. And Poppy's submissiveness and ignorance were even more unbelievable. Obviously, to James, the main characteristic he associated with women and interpreted thusly by the director, was submissiveness.Henry James may have deserved his reputation as a Grand Old Man of (American) letters, but not through this book, it just didn't do it for me."], ["I had many wonderful moments while reading this book, moments when the writing halted the reading, when I had to pause and admire and wonder. Moments when the book seemed to speak to my own experience as if it were written expressly for the girl who was me at twenty-two, causing me to wonder how Henry James could have guessed so well the presumptuous ideas I had about life and love at that early stage. All of that is very personal, of course, and not necessarily of interest to other readers, but there were other moments in my reading of The Portrait of a Lady that better merit mention in a review. I had read this book before, about twenty years ago, so although I knew the bare bones of the story, I remembered few of the details. I certainly had no recollection of the early scene in which Isabel Archer walks in on an unknown guest in her aunt\u2019s house. And yet there was something about the lead-up to that scene that caught my attention this time: the house is very still because Isabel\u2019s uncle is dying. Out of the silence comes the sound of someone playing the piano. Wonderingly, Isabel makes her way toward the source of the harmony. Those six words were like a bell ringing in my mind. I felt a sharpening of interest, an awareness of how pivotal this moment would be in the story. I remember thinking: I've been reading this book with all senses on alert and this is my reward; I've sensed the author\u2019s excitement at the turn his story is about to take. There was another scene later in the book when I had a similar feeling of change about to happen: Isabel sits up late one night in Rome pondering a difficult decision, indeed pondering all the decisions in her life so far. The reader watches with her and wonders how she will act. And wonders again when she finally does.There are other major shifts in the narrative but none stood out for me quite the way those two did. In fact, Henry James purposely avoids describing the most significant shift of all, skipping a three-year section of Isabel\u2019s life completely - which is a very effective narrative device of course, introducing both surprise and suspense in a story that has only a six-year span in total. As a reader I appreciated both strategies: the emphasis he seemed to place on some scenes and the complete omission he allowed to others. It was all very wonderful. In fact this book has revised my idea of what \u2018wonderful\u2019 means. 'The Portrait of a Lady' is vying for a place as the highlight of my Henry James reading year even though The Ambassadors was already firmly camped in that position. I've decided they can be the joint highlight - they have a lot of wonderfulness in common.When I finished 'The Portrait', I turned to HJ\u2019s 1906 appendix and found a paragraph about his concerns for the reader. He writes that he has purposely piled brick upon brick for our benefit, carefully including the details that will enable us to grasp the totality of his creation. And among those details, he mentions two in particular, keystones in the building of the story as it were. The first is the piano scene I described earlier. He speaks of the rare chemistry of that scene in which Isabel recognizes that a huge change is about to happen in her life. I felt really validated as a reader to have been aware in advance of the significance of what I was about to read, and so I wasn't surprised when his other pivotal scene turned out to be the one where Isabel sits up late into the Roman night, pondering her decisions. This is the sixteenth Henry James book I've read in six months. Perhaps I've learnt something of the way his writer\u2019s mind works!More confirmation of that possibility came when he began to discuss the shape of this novel. He continues to speak in terms of bricks and architecture and proportions, and he says that of all his novels, 'The Portrait' is the best proportioned with the exception of a novel he was to write twenty-two years later: The Ambassadors. Alongside a certain \u2018roundness\u2019 in shape which they share, he finds they also share a kind of supporting beam or rib that runs through them. This rib is made from two minor but key characters, Henrietta Stackpole and Maria Gostrey. Both seem extraneous to each story at first glance yet both are central to the architecture of their particular story. I remember noting that Maria Gostrey was the thread that allowed me to find my way through the labyrinth that was 'The Ambassadors' so it was wonderful to hear Henry James confirm that, and underline the links between the two books as well. I was also reminded that I had begun to look at his books in terms of architecture while reading The Wings of the Dove, so I really appreciated his architectural metaphors.In fact the appendix left me amazed and wondering at every turn. In the updates, I quoted part of a paragraph on his theories about the \u2018house of fiction\u2019. I'd like to quote the whole thing here because it is really worth reading - and it provided me with huge insights into some Gerald Murnane books I've puzzled over in the past, The Plains and Inland, and offered a strong desire to read his Million Windows:The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million - a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbors are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; \u201cfortunately\u201d by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the \u201cchoice of subject\u201d; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the \u201cliterary form\u201d; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his \u201cmoral\u201d reference.\u2026\u2026\u2026This book is the final one in my 2017 Henry James season and I can't think of a better title to finish on. But in every ending there are beginnings - 'The Portrait' has led me to another book: Henry James says he took the slight \u2018personality\u2019, the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl and created what he called \u2018an ado about Isabel Archer\u2019. That reference has prompted me to go back to Shakespeare and read Much Ado About Nothing. I do love when one book leads to another!"], ["Ugh, ech, the elitism that breeds in readers! We think we're such nicey cosy bookworms and wouldn't harm a fly but we seethe, we do. Of course, readers of books just naturally look down on those who don't read at all. In fact they try not to think of those people (nine tenths of the human race I suppose, but a tenth of the human race is still a big number) because it makes them shudder. (How lovely it would be to go riding in a carriage through some dreadful council estate flinging free copies of Ulysses and Mrs Dalloway right and left (although Ulysses might catch some of those urchins a hefty blow on the temple (which might cause a shift in their brain landscape and evoke a sudden craving for modernist novels, like when people are struck by a bus and wake up talking in a French accent, that can happen))). So that's one obvious kind of reader elitism. But then, some readers think that what the majority of readers actually read is appalling (Hungervinciboneskitehelpslappery Twilit Shades of Pottery doo dah). It's not that you read, it's what you read. Of course. And then, amongst those elevated readers, some literary authors are considered greater than some others (why are you wasting your time with William Gaddis when you could be knee-deep in Proust, dwarling? I simply don't understand it). And then, even when you scale the heights and find yourself munching down some Henry James like he was the last well-done steak (with Chateau Lafleur) you were going to get before your solo trek (no huskies) to the south pole, you still get it - oh dwarling, why are you still dillydallying in the Middle Period when you still haven't read The Golden Bowl you naughty Jamesian you!Thus it is that I say - oh no, not The Portrait of a Lady. Too too obvious. Try The Awkward Age or The Ambassadors. Much better."], ["Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady is considered to be one of the first American novels to make full use of social and psychological realism as European authors - such as Flaubert, Balzac and George Eliot - were already practicing in their works. Considered to be his biggest accomplishment along with The Ambassadors, Portrait added Isabel Archer to the company of great fictional heroines - as the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, Becky Sharp and Jane Eyre - and, in a century marked by unsatisfied bourgeois wives and adultery in fiction - Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina come to mind -, it was a breath of fresh air to accompany and delve into James' protagonist's thoughts and inner feelings.Starting with a very slow pace, the narrative contains long and elaborate descriptions. It feels James is painting a richly detailed picture for every scene. As we arrive in Gardencourt - the Touchett's English country estate where our story opens and closes -, we encounter Mr. Touchett, his son Ralph and a family friend called Lord Warburton. Among other things, they discuss how Mrs. Lydia Touchett is in America and will bring along her niece called Isabel Archer to visit Europe.Isabel is a young woman, from Albany, New York, who accepts her aunt's offer to initially stay with her in Gardencourt and then later travel through the continent, eager to explore and be enriched by the places she's never been before and experience life at its fullest. Upon her arrival, we begin to learn what her ideals and plans are, along with her hopes and dreams.Since the beginning, her cousin Ralph seems to have been as curious as we were to see what Isabel would make of her life. In a way, we almost could say Ralph was conducting an experiment: Isabel had an independent mind, she was emotionally and psychologically self-sufficient - didn't seem inclined to get married for the time being, which was different for a girl of her age at the time. She was thirsty for knowledge first and foremost: \u201cI don\u2019t want to begin life by marrying\u201d, Isabel asserts to Ralph. \u201cThere are other things a woman can do.\" But without money, how far could she go with her unattached ways? She was probably bound to eventually getting married. Her cousin, then, arranged it and she became financially independent as well. Certain that he was doing Isabel a good deed, Ralph convinced his father - who was very fond of Isabel - at his deathbed to leave her an impressive amount of money. Now she had all that was necessary to decide her destiny without any barriers or anyone to hold her back. The experiment was on.After traveling for over a year, the now wealthy Isabel Archer is in Florence, where her aunt lives. A friend she greatly admired, Madame Merle - Mrs. Touchett's close friend who Isabel got acquainted with some time after she arrived in Gardencourt - skillfully introduces her to Gilbert Osmond: an American expatriate widower who's lived in Italy for years. Isabel is very impressed with his refinement and intelligence and thinks of him as having a beautiful mind. Despite her family and friends complaints about this relationship, Isabel - after having declined two previous suitors - accepts Osmond's marriage proposal.The story then jumps in time and there's a narrative shift: for a bit, James leaves Isabel and Osmond in the background while he focuses on Pansy Osmond - Osmond's young daughter - and Edward Rosier - Isabel's childhood friend who's in love with Miss Osmond and is trying to get Madame Merle to help him marry his darling girl. Through their story, we still have glimpses of Isabel's life and we learn that she's been now married for two years and that she lost a son who died six months after his birth. Isabel and her husband seems to disagree about everything and we learn she's unhappy.Henry James, who once conducted a very slow paced - almost contemplative - narrative, gradually started to accelerate it, adding drama and a sense of urgency to his words. Right after an unsettling argument with Osmond one evening, Isabel, now feeling more distraught than ever, starts pondering and analyzing the many circumstances she finds herself in. The author immerses us in a deeply personal and intensely psychological account of her thoughts and emotions. Among the things Isabel reflected upon for a long time were the conclusion that her husband must hate her and the realization that Osmond had gained total control of her - the once independent and strong witted woman was now a subjugated spirit; the woman who once seemed to be against doing what was expected of her was now conforming to her husband's decisions. \"When the clock struck four she got up; she was going to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets.\"Complicating things even further is the revelation Countess Gemini - Osmond's sister - makes to Isabel of a long time secret, that leaves her completely shaken. This only comes to deteriorate even more her relationship with Gilbert. Now, fully aware of the situation she was put in through manipulations and schemes, Isabel is faced with a big decision: her cousin Ralph is dying in Gardencourt and her dictatorial husband is completely against her visiting England. Showing the old Isabel may still be somewhere locked inside of herself, she confronts her husband and leaves to be with her cousin.The Portrait of a Lady, through its length, presents a number of opposites, but the most striking ones are the battles between freedom vs. destiny and affection vs. betrayal. In the book's final moments, we witness that Isabel is offered a way to go back to where and to whom she was when she first came to Europe: \"The world's all before us - and the world's very big\", she is told. She could once again explore life and fill herself with hopes - but declined the opportunity: \"The world's very small\", she answered. With a much talked about conclusion that has both fascinated and infuriated - another battle of opposites? - readers, James' ending remains open to a lot of interpretations.It's disturbing to watch an unhappily married woman with an opportunity to leave it all behind - and the means to do it - simply not choosing freedom. Did Osmond finally accomplish to shatter her spirit? Another theory is that maybe marriage was an unbreakable vow and she felt she had a moral duty to her husband. Or was she trying to be protective of Pansy - who was mirroring Isabel's unhappiness and was another example of a woman who seemed to think that she was obliged to follow other's decisions even if it made her unhappy - and determined to stand by her side and not let the same happen to her step daughter? Innumerable possibilities...James has been known for structuring his novels with a series of circles surrounding a center. With that in mind, a hopeful interpretation of the book's ending is that, in order to complete that circle, Isabel must return to her husband, properly end her marriage so she could once again be able to start anew and free her spirit once and for all.Rating: for such an interesting and comprehensive analysis of freedom, human consciousness and ultimately, existentialism: 4 stars."], ["Book Review\n\n3+ out of 5 stars for The Portrait of a Lady, a classic story called the \"Great American Novel,\" written by Henry James in 1881. I adore Henry James and found great enjoyment in his literary works when I began reading him in my freshmen year at college. As an English major, I was exposed to many different authors, but I felt a strong connection with him and this literary period. American realistic works spoke to me above any of the other \"classic\" books I had been reading. As a result, I chose Henry James as the primary focus of an independent study course I'd taken in my senior year. I read 6 or 7 of his books during those 3 months and am going back now to provide quick reviews, as not everyone finds him as enjoyable as I do. I also don't want to bore everyone with a lengthy review on how to interpret him or his books.The Portrait of a Lady tells the story of a young woman who years to have her own life and make her own mark on the world. She doesn't want to be contained by marriage or the structure in place at the time in the late 19th century. She has different characteristics coming from American, English and continental European female archetypes. She has strong moral and ethical values. She knows who she is, yet she does not know all. As she moves through life, she makes choices that are not easy for her to execute. What I loved about this work is its deep exploratory view points, beautiful language and unparalleled characters. Though I only give it a 3, when compared to some of this other works, I would recommend you read a few chapters or sections, just to see if it is something you could find yourself getting lost in.The impact you feel upon reading this book is questioning what is the true view of a lady, how is she different from generation to generate, location to location and societal class to societal class. James knows women. He is very accurate on many levels... wrong on a few, too. But to put out his thoughts, in a huge tome, at a time when women were beginning to get more rights... and be able to cross genres and genders... is amazing. It's less about what he says and more about how he says it. And that's why I enjoy reading him... but even I admit, I can only take 1 book every few years! :)\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Isabel Archer is a young American lady, for whom the novel is titled, who is adventurous and very independent. She turns down two marriage proposals in the 1st half of the book to preserve her independence, one from Casper Goodwood, a young wealthy American, and one from Lord Warburton, a wealthy English aristocrat. When her English uncle dies, she inherits a large sum of money and travels with her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, to her Italian villa where she eventually meets, falls in love with, and marries Gilbert Osmond. All of her family and friends try to dissuade her from this, but to no avail, and she finally learns that Osmond doesn't love her, married her for her money, and to own her as another of his possessions. Obviously there is a lot more intrigue to the story and the enjoyment for me came from the wonderful writing of James."], ["Exquisite, cozy, at times funny, at times sad, and unforgettable. I won\u2019t bore readers with another summary of the story; they\u2019re abundant on this site. I will say that with Isabel Archer, James earns his place in the canon with a proto-feminist (yes, I said it, proto-feminist) novel of a remarkable, if hard to describe heroine, who is faithful to her idea(l)s, rejects the affections of strong (but good) men, and suffers unnecessarily at the hands of a Machiavellian cad and an equally manipulative woman. If you don\u2019t like long novels\u2014avoid this one like a plague. If you don\u2019t like novels written in style from another era, get thee hence! If wordy, complicated sentences are anathema to you, you\u2019ve probably already stopped reading this mini-review.If I were to advise a reader at all, I\u2019d suggest reading it in as short a period as you can. Bite the bullet, finish it off keeping as much in mind as you can. I\u2019d also advise reading it on a Kindle (for the built-in dictionary) or, at the very least, keep a dictionary at hand. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have; and if you don\u2019t\u2014if you read the wrong book for you (this one), please, please, don\u2019t say James is an idiot (or some equivalent) or that the book is just boring (or some equivalent)\u2014instead, face the fact, you read the wrong book."]], "review_count": "2", "description": "<b>Civility and society come head to head in Henry James\u2019 seminal work.</b><br /><br /><br /><br />The heroine of this powerful novel is the spirited young American Isabel Archer.

Miller\u2019s status as a provocateur is well-earend, his style a frenetic mash-up of Dostoevsky, Lawrence and Selby. Sexus is incoherent, meandering and shameless, but compelling and unavoidably stimulating."], ["It is an ode to Mara-Mona, that is to say to June, the second wife of the author, which he will celebrate many times in his work.The first chapter opens in the dance hall where, the day before, the narrator has just met a hostess who sells his dances and his company to men alone. From there, Miller leads his reader in a round of characters which he has already made us admire certain samples. I will mention only one name - who does not need comment: the ineffable Kronski.But Sexus is especially an opportunity for Miller to refine his hyper-manly character, able to satisfy all women - or almost. That he is with Mara, who, at a certain moment, asks Kronski \"humbly\" if \"she is really worthy of Henry\" (!!!), does not prevent him from fornication on the right and on the left, and even with his lawful wife while both of them started their divorce proceedings. The reader immediately notes that it is almost Maude who asks him.I believe in the American author too much intelligence and subtlety for not having painted in vain such an unflattering portrait of himself. Because he is deeply involved in the story of his life - the fact that he embellishes many details or arranges them in a more theatrical perspective does not detract from this depth - Miller knows he can not back down: this time, he will not be able to content himself with touching the Miller gigolo, the Miller macho, the cowardly coward and running away that he was too. Therefore, with a jovial skill and talent that can not be challenged, the writer then reveals everything that shocks and scandalizes in him as never will the language he loves grow.The most extraordinary is that, throughout these almost 500 pages (pocket edition), we do not think for a moment to plant there Henry, his sex, his blenmorragies, his women, his scams to the money, his blackmail to feelings, his cooking and the unlikely friends he drags in his wake. Sometimes, it's true, we stop, we wonder: let's see, this exhibitionist tightrope who, completely drunk, makes us sneaky up there, on this rope that has the edge of a razor blade, is it really the great Henry Miller? Unbelievable ! Despite all that we already knew about his sexual frenzy, his emotional complications and the man's life he maintained, for example, with Anais Nin, we would never have thought of him...And yet, despite everything, we keep him (the author) a small place deep in our heart. No one is perfect, they say to themselves and at least we can not tax hypocrisy this writer who perseveres to paint in such colors.Ultimate wink addressed to the reader by the text itself: the anecdote that Miller reports on Knut Hansum, one of the authors he loved. I let you discover it, it resembles the part of Miller's shadow: annoying, pitiful, cunning, arrogant and yet so naive that we can not help smiling as we would before the escapades of a poor kid but brilliant. ;O) The first read I were at a first pubescent age."], ["This is such a difficult book to write about because it's so expansive and so forthright in its world view. This is my first foray into Henry Miller and lets just say that it has truly altered my perceptions, and affected my world view. Miller is a nutjob, and often times you can't help but loathe his actions and are revolted by his way of thinking, but this is where he succeeds and makes his strongest victories. Miller's writing is the most confessional personal essay one can imagine. He never shies away from telling us of his more devious visions in order to create a more likeable personality for himself. He strips himself bare and includes his most bizarre sexual and primal impulses. Obviously there is a strong emphasis on the book's sexual proclivities as it was a pivotal moment in the deconstruction of our country's censorship laws, but Miller (I believe) is not trying to be overtly graphic in his sex writing merely to shock people so he can sell more books. In my opinion he includes the sex scenes in all their detailed glory because he wants to give them as much space in his writing as they exist in his world. Sex is a huge part of most people's lives, be it actually having sex or merely thinking about it. Miller was an especially amorous person, so a book about his life is going to contain a lot of sexual writing. Is this a sensational way to write a book? Damn right. But the beauty of Miller is that he couldn't give two shits. He is driven and unrepentant of any of his beliefs. He wasn't trying to start a revolution here, he was just writing the only way he could. And controversial subject matter aside, it's just worth reading for the poetic style of his prose which contains some of the most aesthetically beautiful sentences, forget content, that I have ever read. There are times I would read paragraphs out loud to myself just to hear the way they sounded coming off my tongue. So yeah, I like Henry Miller. He has won me over as a convert and I'm very excited to delve deeper into his other writings."], ["I believe that the trilogy title The Rosy Crucifixion is a free interpretation of the mystical term Rosicrucianism \u2013 the Order of the Rosy Cross\u2026 Thus Henry Miller is a Rosicrucian and alchemist of passion and the name of the novel Sexus wholly expresses the contents of the book.The best thing about writing is not the actual labor of putting word against word, brick upon brick, but the preliminaries, the spade work, which is done in silence, under any circumstances, in dream as well as in the waking state. In short, the period of gestation.And for the artist of Henry Miller\u2019s calibre this period of gestation and the spade work is an ecstasy of love.His mouth would wreath itself in a veritable mandibular ecstasy; he would work himself up until the very soul of him came forth in a spongy ectoplasmic substance. It was a horrible state of affection, terrifying because it knew no bounds. It was a depersonalized glut or slop, a hangover from some archaic condition of ecstasy \u2013 the residual memory of crabs and snakes, of their prolonged copulations in the protoplasmic slime of ages long forgotten.And Henry Miller\u2019s love confessions are a boiling geyser of martyr\u2019s lust.Even being crucified, if one is crucified by love, may be an excruciating delight\u2026"], ["Henry Miller is nothing short of a favorite writer of mine, after just one book. I feel like I discovered a whole new universe between his pages. I feel like I\u2019ve been let in a secret club of people who can feel so deeply that their hearts beat in the spine of the book, who can be filled with so much of anything that their blood oozes in the spaces between letters. To say that I like his writing is an understatement \u2013 I fell in love with it. This semi - autobiographical work is, in itself, very good fiction. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s embellished, in true style of every over achieving author, but it\u2019s not embellished to the point where you don\u2019t believe it anymore. The characters are real, they\u2019re human through their flaws, through their denial and acceptance of life\u2019s moments, they are a bunch of \u201ccharacters\u201d in the real sense of the word: people whom you find hard to believe you would see on the street, in your neighborhood, because such individuals could only gravitate around someone like Miller. He is the center piece of this trilogy, and by all means, he has to be. His portrayal of himself is pathetic: he\u2019s a man of a thousand vices, of which just the first are women and alcohol, he is weak in his will to do anything except for laying around and having fun, he is defined, ultimately, by his cowardice and laziness. How, can you ask, is he then the great man that I advertise him to be? Well, he\u2019s a genius - the way he writes beggars belief. I could not have expected more out of his work, and I feel sad that I haven\u2019t read him earlier. There might be people out there who find his style shallow and empty, as his life was all about himself, sex, himself, literature, himself, sex, alcohol, sex.. you get the point. But I beg to differ \u2013 even in his most dirty episodes, those that give feminists heart attacks, he never shames women, never debases them. They are, to him, part of the few things beautiful in this world, part of what is to be worshipped, be it that his prayers come in the form of sex (did I say he had a lot of sex?). In order to understand his take on women better, I advise anyone interested to read his correspondence with his wife, Anais Nin. They are exquisitely beautiful declarations of love and you can recognize his penmanship in there, as well.

Predominantly, it is my sexual navigation of an exotic creature \u2013 Mara; not before circumnavigating Irene, Sylvia and numerous dripping lassies. Irene that horny cunt can make a man bleed. No wonder her husband is paralytic. She must have twisted his cock off. Poor Ulrich couldn\u2019t keep up with the all night orgy. Sylvia on the other hand is dull as ditch water. Mara, that bitch can get me barmy giving me a hard on even when I\u2019m looking at the bitter hag -my wife. I am so hung up on her blowjobs and taxi quickies, I overlook that she is an impetuous liar.2) Maude my present wife is such a wrench. Fucking her makes me feel like a necrophiliac. Although it is not a nuisance as I can bang any crap with a hole, yet her customary snide of me being a promiscuous prick, not caring about the family or my child smacks the shit out of me.3) My cronies- Dr. Kronski, Ulrich (my sidekick in sexual burlesque), Stanley, etc.. are a bunch of sympathetic drunks with suicidal or fatal aspirations, except get them some twirling willowy legs and they can hump like rabbits.4) Sex is one of the nine reasons of reincarnation. So, each time I get a stiff bulge in my pants I come across ways to attain salvation.5) If the frequent usage of racially provocative or prejudiced language astounds the proverbial reader, chew a nickel and get on with it. I can\u2019t help if I\u2019m the cruelest sexist asshole.6) At times when my penis does not take a call, I do manage to pen down sensible libretto arguing the significance of being a writer and life as we call it. However, me being a narcissistic prick, eventually the narration embellishes all-night orgy sessions with couple of lou-lous and Ulrich.7) Several readers consider me to be a pervert dickhead while some contemplate about my genius collaboration of imaginative intelligentsia. Yes! My common sense does take a hike at times, but that\u2019s who I am \u2013 a raunchy, egoistical mastermind of sexual emancipation.Hush Miller! We get it! You are as horny as a three-balled tomcat with a swamped gutter mouth.In conclusion, as to sum it all up, Sexus is a freakishly fascinating reserve."], ["Henry Miller always writes with a surge of life being pushed through his pen. His stories, countless stories, always with another point of view - at one moment, as an all-knowing superior man, and the next, as a good-for-nothing, useless piece of garbage that's floating about the air. He's all too ready to express his truth, even when it doesn't serve him favorably. Who can't relate?Sex is part of life. The view that Henry Miller is attempting to show himself off as some kind of Casanova has never come through to me. He writes objectively, as if to say 'Yeah, it happened. This is what it was.' and before you know it, he's gallanting into some other room, all together unconcerned with the scene he was just inextricably a part of.Who hasn't received something from reading some Henry Miller? You can learn to live from his books, if even a small compartment of your life."], ["I intended to give it 3 stars but because of the last 2 chapters - almost 50 pages - i decided that it deserve the 4 stars.The big difference between \"Sexus\" and his first two gems \"Tropic of Cancer\" and \"Tropic of Capricorn\" is that here there's a lot of sex without any aesthetic or artistic purposes. Also many times i feel he constrained the events and encounters with other characters. his ordinary nonsense about life and women reach another high limit.He still got the great talent of a bohemian artist, still use the most remarkable language among American novelists. You can keep reading for many successive hours without felling boring except for the unnecessary porn scenes.The most remarkable parts in Sexus are :- When he tried to get rid of Maude by convincing her ex-lover to save her from him.- The party he arranged for his friends when he got the bonus.- His definition of creation and creativity.- How Melanie got into the book.- His dream of Una.- Kent Hamson's letter.- Finally the most beautiful parts i've ever read by Miller until now is the last 50 pages which starts with Cleo at Minsky brothers then the two deaths of Osmanli the Turk, and the end with Miller the dog and his woof!

He is pretty much your typical Willeford character and nothing that he does really surprises you in that sense. I spotted some similarities with some of the Chester Himes Harlem Cycle novels I've read and rather more interestingly Springer's desire to live as easily as possible called to mind Robert Heinlein's famous character Lazarus Long who inadvertently worked harder than he ever would have in trying to do as little as possible in every task he was ever assigned.It's a hardboiled little tale of greed, lust and deception that provides the reader with existential questions without putting the thoughts in the head of the protagonist, pure 50s pulp gold, and it even has interracial relations and violence to boot."], ["A lot of Willeford fans like this one but I thought it was crap. Once you get past the short punch line (phony white minister takes over a black church and leads them) there's nothing much going on here. No big payoff, no character development to speak of.

It would be limiting to call him a crime novelist or pulp novelist, but what else to call him? In any case, this wild, wooly little book follows a third-rate white author who comes upon an opportunity to be a preacher in an all-black church in Civil Rights Era Florida. He's not a believer by any means, but he figures that he can collect a good salary, cough up two sermons every Sunday, and spend the rest of the time working on his second book. When he gets there, however, he enters into flimflammery of another kind, using a Rosa Parks-like incident to unite other parishes in a bus boycott, all while funneling donations to the cause into an account in Atlanta. He also looks to steal a worshiper's hot-to-trot wife while he's at it. This whole crazy scenario starts with our hero opening his first sermon by talking about the life of Franz Kafka, and it gets more fevered from there. Good stuff."], ["I don't have the energy to write a review, so here's a few thoughts on the novel:* As Springer is searching, somewhat unconsciously, I feel like the book is searching as well. It flirts with many ideas but ultimately abandons almost all of them. Was that intentional? * Was the book trying to make a point? I often felt it was trying to comment on race-relations, but the stance the novel takes ended up indifferent. * Surprisingly light on violence, but that's a good thing here - When the violence comes, it has a certain impact because of it's scarcity. * Great pacing in the last 2/3rds.* What is it with this genre and the trope of a gorgeous woman who want to screw the protagonist as soon as they meet?* It was entertaining as hell.* It doesn't belong in the Noir Hall of Fame (is that a thing? That should be a thing.) but it's a good and quick read for anyone who likes the genre, or generally pulpy fiction from the middle of the 20th century.* Why in the blue hell doesn't Hard Case Crime reprint Willeford? It seems like a no-brainer. * Speaking of which, t's a shame that it's so hard to find a decent copy of this book. I read the edition published by blackmask.com which no longer exists. It boasts a plain, ugly black cover with the original cover art in a very small square amid the darkness. On the bright side, Wits-End books has came out with a (kind of pricey) edition under the title  The Black Mass of Brother Springer.  I haven't seen it in person, but it's probably your best bet if you want a physical copy. * My eyes burn. I'm tired. It's 4 AM. Jesus, why am I awake?"], ["Who would believe Pulp Religion?Sam Springer has been ordained and called to a small church in the Negro (late 50s) part of Jax Florida.

Too soon, he becomes the focus of Klan activity, a lot of donation money, and a parishioner's wife. He arrived at this impasse of identity because in his respectable life he faced:\"My monthly payment of $78.60 on my house was five days overdue. My car payment on my three-year-old Pontiac was one month overdue. A small payment, only $42.50 per month, to be sure.... I owed the milkman $5.40 for the current month, the grocer for groceries delivered during the month, the telephone bill, the television repair bill for a new booster for the picture tube, and several other sundry bills, including an unfulfilled pledge at the Unitarian Fellowship Society.\"Brother Springer quickly admits (to himself) that he has no \"faith,\" but his sermons do inspire the faithful and fuels social protest.

It's amazing how it sprang into life from the first page and took me back to that state of amazement I felt the first time I read it. I was especially moved by the introduction from Donald Westlake, which is not in the earlier editions. Westlake really nails it. Willeford earned the ultimate reward--honor and respect from the best-selling writers in the noir genre.In 1958, when this book was published, Willeford was a struggling pulp fiction writer. Although he published several remarkable books during this period, none of them were big sellers, although they were critically acclaimed. He kept on writing anyway, while paying the bills by teaching writing at Miami Dade College and the University of Miami. Willeford finally hit it big in the 1980's with the Hoke Moseley novels, the first of which (Miami Blues) was made into a damn good film. At that point, he was 61 years old. He wrote three more Moseley novels, all classics, and then he left us. If you are a true Willeford freak, you have to go back and read his pulp classics from the 50's through the 70's. Every single one of them is a gem.Sometimes I feel like screaming to the world, \"If you haven't read Willeford, you're not qualified to discuss postmodern American literature!\""], ["Willeford creates a vivid story in a few amount of words. This is more of a novella, or a long short story, than a book. But it's very engaging and engrossing. It's only 192 pages, but the characters are interesting, and the story keeps you on your toes. The main character, known throughout most of the book, is the Right Reverend Deuteronomy Springer, and he essentially has no redeeming qualities about him. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is that it's a but dated, as it was published in 1958, and you can tell it was written very much in the moment. I enjoyed seeing things like the cheapest meal at a 5-star restaurant costing $4.35, but it was slightly distracting. That doesn't really make sense, because I wouldn't criticize a Laura Ingalls Wilder book for saying that 5 cents was a lot of money to spend on a slate, but there was still something weird about it that I can't quite put my finger on. All in all, it's an interesting book, and I would definitely recommend it for fun reading, especially like on the beach."], ["Originally published as \"The Black Mass of Brother Springer\" and with original 1960s cover art that looks eerily like George W. Bush trying to make some girl in a haystack, this is a must read for any Willeford fan.The book itself is a good read and a fun commentary on religion-as-theater that takes place during the beginning of the Civil Rights Era as told be an almost sociopathic ex-accountant who inherits a phony title as a preacher (The Right Reverend Deuteronomy Springer) and an all-black congregation. But what gets it the extra bump from three to four stars for me is a fanboy-like amusement of a secondary character, a charlatan monk, that more closely parallels the author than any of his other fictional characters."]], "review_count": "0", "description": "Is comedy postmodern?Kirby Olson posits that no one has been more marginalized than the comic writer, whose irreverent truths have always made others uncomfortable. In a literary age that purports to champion diversity, comic writers remain an underclass huddling at the fringes of the canon. Olson challenges the status quo by inviting the comic writer into the center of literary debate.In the growing discipline of humor studies, Olson is the first to create a substantial link between the fields of comedy and postmodernism, discovering in comic writers a philosophy of oddness and paradox that parallels and extends the work of the major postmodern thinkers.With elegant clarity, Comedy After Post-modernism examines: Edward Lear as he invents a comic picturesque to challenge the sublime of Kant and Ruskin Gregory Corso as he explodes the Great Chain of Being of his early Catholicism Philippe Soupault as a comic surrealist undoing the sacrificial aesthetics of Andr\u00e9 Breton P.G. Wodehouse as a social thinker with surprisingly deep affinities to anarchist Peter Kropotkin and radical social theorist Charles Fourier Stewart Home, the infamously violent punk author, as a pacifist whose narrative questions Marxist-anarchist terrorism in favor of patience and tolerance Charles Willeford, the maestro of the black humor police procedural, as a postmodern philosopher who deepens the problems of ethical and aesthetic judgment after postmodernism. \u201cAn original, splendidly researched, and necessary book.

After finishing this book, I have to say that I\u2019m deeply impressed by its originality. There is a lot of subtlety that goes into the book here, Abraham also has created a low fantasy series that\u2019s influenced heavily by Eastern culture especially with the way he implemented poses in the characters daily activities. However, the average rating on Goodreads speaks for itself already, this is not a book that most readers will enjoy. There aren\u2019t any mythical beings (except for one, I guess), this book contained zero actions, literally zero actions throughout the whole book because the plot revolves heavily around politics, the pacing of the book also moved at an extremely slow pace and I, who loved slow paced books, found it was too slow at times. That said, Abraham\u2019s characters are multi-layered, the engaging yet beautiful prose and the world-building was also excellent. These three factors were very important in making me invested in the book and yes, I am really invested to continue. Not to mention, the concept of andat was incredibly interesting and I can\u2019t wait to see what the series has to offer on this.\n\n\u201cPossibility is a wide field, dear. \u201dCan't\" is a word for small imaginations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite a short book and in my opinion, Abraham has created something super unique in the market with this book and I will continue to the sequel. From the first book alone, I can conclude that A Shadow in Summer is a totally foundational book, making this series a slow burn series; I envision this is also one of those series that only gets better with each installment and I'm going to find out about it immediately.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"], ["When you've read fantasy for as long as I have you get tired of the fact that 90% of fantasy tales revolved around a dumb farm boy who is the missing heir to the kingdom or to long gone magical powers, he has a good heart but can't seem to get the girl, he has to leave home and help the world/nation/kingdom against some Dark Lord, who tends to be archetype and has some old mentor who gives him the sword/magical talisman to win and kick the beejesus out of the Dark Lord. Oh, and then he gets the girl usually or finds someone better than the girl because the girl wasn't a very nice person. Heh. Back then there weren't too many variations on this tale unless you wanted to read Michael Moorcock or maybe H.P. Lovecraft, though, he's more horror than fantasy. Nowadays, fantasy is beginning to shift to grittier/realistic tales; George R.R. Martin being at the forefront. So, now, it isn't about such tales so much and if it is the dumb farm boy might not be such a nice guy or he may lose against the enemy. Maybe, unlike traditional fantasy, someone can wear black and not be a bad person. So, saying all that for those who have walked with the fantasy genre as long as I have, we finally get to encounter a novel that takes another spin. A SHADOW IN SUMMER has a distinctive Asian flair to it with almost no focus on the usual medieval European setting. Moreover, there isn't some Dark Lord to defeat. The tale focuses on politics between various factions within the city of all cities. This city has gained the powers of a powerful spirit that has the ability to give the city a major up in the cotton trade by taking the seed out of cotton plants, thus, giving them a huge advantage upon other cities that need to hand pick the seeds out of each cotton bushel. Naturally, other cities, most notably one similar to a European one, wants to free that spirit or control that spirit so that they can then monopolize the cotton trade. So the whole story is about various groups either trying to do this or about other people investigating this plot, not quite realizing the full details until later. One of the world details I liked about this world and that is based on historical facts is that the people communicate very much in body language rather than words so people will be talking and then take on a pose of apology, love, joy, anger or conciliation. It's definitely a nice touch. So read this book if you like intrigue, court politics and strong characters, who are not the usual archetypes and are actually doing something besides running the from the minions of the Dark Lord.

The society, the empire, is also quite fleshed out and has a character all of its own. I have no complaints with any of that. Indeed, I think it's quite remarkable.I don't even have a problem with the premise, both literally through the magic that this old poet has, or stylistically, or plot-based, that this old man and the empire are one and the same. Both are old, as are quite a few of the main characters, and you can see that they're wracked with guilt and a bit of senility. Rightly so, I might say. Using magic to forcibly abort children with or without the woman's consent is unconscionable, as is a society that has no qualms with enslaving, whether with economics, force, or the Poet's magic of conception.It's rotten, and the death of one is the death of all, and I can't really find it in my heart to feel sad for either.As a novel, it is a beautiful painting, glacially slow and majestic like like the adjective. I think it *IS* beautiful, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good novel.If you don't mind good character studies and an exploration of culpability, duty, justice, and love rather than a modern fantasy yarn full of death and daring and heroism, then I think you might really enjoy this novel.Even now that I've finished it with a sigh and a fairly large undercurrent of regret that it didn't live up to some undefinable promise, I want to like it more than I do. I have great respect for Mr. Abraham already, so it's not like I'm giving up the cause. I'm a fanboy of the Expanse, after all.I know I'll give the other four of this series a shot, but I might not do it right away."], ["Via Book Reviews by Niki Hawkes at www.nikihawkes.comI will be the first one to admit that the overview sounds a little boring and convoluted.

It was fascinating and engaging \u2013 starting out by introducing a complex communication system that involves intricate hand gestures that conveys everything from emotion to social status. And you know what? It only got better! Abraham then went on to developed a mind \u2013 blowing magic system that was as dangerous as it was beautiful. These elements combined with an unforgettable writing style made for one of the most original stories I have ever read!Both the communication and magic systems went a long way to build this world, but Abraham expanded on it anyway and created a stunning city that I can still remember vividly years later. Top that off with an incredible cast of characters (who will have you laughing and crying with them by the time the series ends) and you have one of the most memorable stories on the market. All of the characters were amazing and they only got better with each book.I loved every minute, and I\u2019ll say it again: this was easily one of the best series I\u2019ve ever read.

Yes.\u2019Seedless smiled and nodded. \u2018What a terrible thought,\u2019 he said. \u2018That love and injustice should be married.\u2019The main merit of A Shadow in Summer lies in how its Author bound ideas into words and then formed them into a language comprehensible for us, ordinary human beings. As to the lives these ideas led, the choices they made, the roads they had taken and the tales that could be told about it - that is altogether a different matter. Abraham\u2019s worldbuilding ideas take us to the world where sophisticated and developed albeit waning civilisation of the East struggles for power with quite primitive and brutish ascendant culture stylised in the western manner. The Summer Cities of the Khainate live off on the scraps of an imperium gone by. They are still resplendent, still rich beyond measure, overflowing with goods and pleasures; each of them independent and yet interdependent - immersed in the ebbs and flows of international trade. Arrogant yet secure in their frivolities by the powers wielded by poets. For you see, only the poet is able to grasp and then hold the andat. What is the andat? Andat are like thoughts made real, ideas tamed and given human shape, thoughts translated by the poet into a form that includes volition, more difficult to hold each time they escape. Inevitably, the more scarce they become, the greater treasure they were. Especially that when faced with the raw but crude power of other nations, the cities of the East had the andat as their ultimate and only weapons. \u201cI am a slave, my dear. The slave you hope to own.\u201dI admit, I thought the idea of the andat ingenious in its simplicity. But Mr Abraham surpassed all my expectations when like a fine wordsmith, he wrought a form for his idea and then breathed life into it creating Seedless. Seedless, neither the slave nor a puppet and a little bit of both, simultaneously compassionate god and malefic prankster, neither a monster nor a beast and yet so very elemental and inhuman, is a character so total that he could wander through the pages of Dostoyevsky or Mann, if any of them ever bothered to write fantasy, and never would be out of place.\u2018I think we\u2019re past things like forgiveness,\u2019 she said. \u2018We\u2019re the servants of what we have to do.\u2019This is so precisely because characterisation is the second pillar elevating A Shadow in the Summer above the average. It is not merely the gallimaufry of protagonists. The art lies in how with each word they gain depth and colour, how the cardboard figures absorb conventional tropes and fold them into intricate shapes. This book is like a human origami. You know I look askance at cliches. But here cliches flare with new life; the coming-to-age, the star-crossed lovers, the late lovers, the love triangle, the revenge, the from wares to whores (aka. the bordello tycoon trope), the master-apprentice, the younger son - you will find them all in this novel. But don\u2019t greet them like old friends - they will be as surprising as they are disturbing and inconvenient. Each of the protagonists stumbles upon the very bedrocks of their own personalities and things that render them unique prove to be both a blessing and a curse. This was the main reason why I couldn\u2019t fully connect with any of the heroes and heroines. They were endearing and annoying at once. Too much like the living people, like us: hard to classify, impossible to pigeonhole. None of them has come out whole from the adventure, none emerged strengthened and refined. Not something you usually get in fantasy, more frequently these types of personal stories are found among the classic novels. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a killer. I\u2019m a poet.

More probably though, it is how masterfully her arc was written; she reminds me Bujold's characters from the World of the Five Gods. In a word where action only complements a word and the form it has taken, she is a shining supernova. I really loved how in this book language is more than words. The protagonists communicate via countless poses and each message has a double, sometimes even triple meaning. Speaking is never reduced to merely talking: \u201cHe answered with a pose so gentle and complex - thankfulness, requesting patience, expressing affection - that it neared poetry.\u201d I was taking poses as I read on! I also appreciated how the tale gives a laudation of conceived life, regardless of its form and stage. What are the weaknesses then, you ask? While the personal stories and arc are superb, the overall plot is convoluted and a bit artificial. The personal stories touch but do not meet head-on. They tangle, but the pattern they form is haphazard, inchoate and disjointed. Furthermore, the whole stratagem develops very slowly and not without bizarre hurdles. The balance between what happens, the meanings the events are supposed to carry and then the actual weight of the narrative lacks equilibrium. Not deeply enough nuanced tension between the lack of free will and the lack of freedom, the general nature of the andat versus the specificity of a flawed design, inconclusive character development of the supposedly main hero built on a twisted sense of loyalty and justice, especially when juxtaposed with his initial rejection of a system that demanded cruelty from him up to the breakup point and lauded him for the breaking - all this together meant that when I finished the book and I was both satisfied and dissatisfied, very disturbed and unsure what to make of the whole story. I was torn and conflicted in my rating between 3 and 4 stars, but taking into consideration the avalanche of reflections this book has awakened in me, I give it a benefit of depth and raise my rating. A Shadow in Summer is definitely worthy of your attention. However, you need to judge very carefully if the novel is actually for you as it does not cater to all the customary needs of an average fantasy reader.

I had no idea what to expect, but I was blown away by how different and complex the plot of this fascinating story offers. If you are expecting a traditional Fantasy with some political jostling in it, you have the wrong book. This is not at all in the realm of the Fantasy I have known up to now. Yes, we have a world of imagination, a city-state made strong by flourishing trade, while the trade itself is supported by the poet-sorcerers and their bonded spirit-slaves. The sorcerers are called poets, because they form the physical representation of an idea and give it to a spirit called Andat, the boundaries of whom are given by how precise the poem and the character of the poet craft it. It is definitely a double-edged sward, since even if the poet believes to have crafted a spirit with only positive and perfect virtues, if there is pain, envy, hatred, or any other such negative intent in the heart of the creator and it bleeds into the poem, something very dangerous comes through into the spirit. Such is the case with Seedless. He is and Andat, given shape and bonded by the poet Heshai, who feels inferior and holds a lot of hatred and negativity in his heart, but wanted to give shape to perfection in Seedless, the way he thought perfection should be. However, completely without meaning it, Heshai infused Seedless with all of his hate and negativity as well, so he is so much evil, bundled up in a perfect physical form. \n\"...\u201cSometimes the hand pulls the puppet, sometimes the puppet pulls the hand, but the string runs both ways.\u201d...\"\nSuch is the case that the city-state of Saraykeht, the most powerful city among the Summer Cities, counts on its poets and the Andats they wield for their crops to be abundant and plenty and for the health of the state to be in balance. No one could foresee an Andat hating its bonds and bondage so much, that is willing to kill itself by destroying the poet and the well-being of the city it was supposed to protect and favor. And it all starts rolling with a forced abortion of a baby who's mother had no idea of the evil about to be perpetuated on her. \n\"...\u201cTo lose everything is not the worst can happen.\"\"It's starting again, from nothing, with nothing,\" Otah said.\"Is exactly this,\" Maj agreed, then a moment later. \"Starting again, and doing better.\u201d ...\"\nThe government of Galt is set on destroying and taking over Saraykeht. Marchat Wilsin is the head of a Galt trading house and Amat, a woman in her fifties with a bad hip and sharp wit is House Wilsin's business manager. Marchat Wilsin is knees deep together with Seedless in the plot to take down the city, no matter the means. Shen Amat finds out, she decides to expose them and slowly gathers information. Just as involved, although unknowingly and unwittingly, are the student poet Maati, the laborer young man Itani (also known as Otah), and his lover, Amat's apprentice Liat, my least favorite character of them all. They all have a place in the intricacies of a story woven from political intrigues, power struggles and machinations, no battles or sword-fights involved at all. For a book having no action sequences and full of just character building and plotting, this was one of the most enthralling books I have read in a while. I was not bored even for a second. And the richness of the world and characters was beautiful and varied. I would recommend this to all who appreciate just plain good writing!!! Give it a try! \n\"...\u201cI'm going to sleep.

Which is odd because I think I'm the first one to complain when Fantasy or Sci-Fi books don't have any action and move slow. Others thought that of this book but it wasn't that way for me. There's just something about DA's writing style where both the characters and world are so descriptive. The emotions and interactions come off the page in HD where another author trying for the same is a black and white 9' built in the 70's."], ["The review that hooked me: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...The review that should've hooked me much earlier: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...I don't think beginning this series with a marathon reading session while sick was the best approach, since fevers make me to skim faster and I missed some intricacies. Illness also makes me so lazy, such that I was unwilling to move even though I'd hunched down into a painful sitting/crouching/fetal position. Despite that (and despite the visual trumpet-blare of the pompous title fonts, and my current aversion to epics) this was an incredible fantasy story. I skipped ahead and around to follow a character's storyline, just because it was so fascinating. I just finished stumbling through the last bits of the 4 books and I'm going to have to get over my epic aversion to re-read this all properly someday. I would give this series more than 4 stars, a little less than 5 stars.10 generations ago (which isn't actually all that long, is it? a few hundred years?) an empire fell and now its remnants, called the Summer Cities, still dominate the world with its wealth, based on a fraction of the power it once had. This power comes from control of creatures called andats, 'ideas given volition' is the description from the book I think, that are created by poets; not those laureates who speak at inaugurations or publish slim volumes or, ahem, rhyme stuff (\"Stop it! I mean it!\" \"Would anybody like a peanut?\" \u2013 that's my kind of poetry), but scholars who strive to completely capture a concept with a special grammar meant for this purpose and hold it in their minds, bending it to their will...magic. The andat takes on the form and personality imagined by the poet, an embodiment of the creator's mind. Unfortunately, once caught and lost, the exact same idea can't be recaptured. If you try, you die. The grammar has to be adjusted to describe it differently if possible; as the years go on, it becomes impossible to find a unique description and the andat, the idea, has to be abandoned. It's possible to bestow an andat upon another person, another poet. Each of the cities has its own poet, each andat's power used to boost the particular trade that is the basis of each city's economy.The Summer Cities culture is obviously drawn from Asia, with the almond eyes and teahouses, but how beautiful the added touches are! Letters having edges sewn with silk thread are tucked into sleeves; firekeepers maintain braziers along major thoroughfares during cold months; the language consists of as many gestures as words; the suffix -kvo is used for teachers, -cha for respect, and -kya for great affection \u2013 grace notes in this wicked awesome story. And man, can this author write. Too many lines that made me pause to appreciate, even in a feverish haze. I wish I had the head to remember quotes to share them, but all I remember is the lift that comes from knowing something is very good.This first book introduces the world (building it, hah). It begins at the poet school where we learn how they attempt to select the right people to potentially wield andats. Then fast-forward to a young poet sent to one of the cities to be ready to take on the residing poet's andat when the time comes. A plot to destroy the current poet is revealed to be just a feeler. Threading around the plot are all the human relations that complicate everything. There is the expected love triangle, whatever, but better is the delicate hum of Marchat and Amat. Wonderful and quietly sad. Anyway, the feeler plot felt flabby and small until it swelled to include nations and then gut-punches a reader with a series of, uh, punches. In the gut. That final sentence, wow. It's like the whole book was an orchestra just before a performance, sawing bows and turning knobs, an oddly harmonious dissonance (heh, I know, dumb, but when the strings are tuning and don't quite match but all sound like a piece of silk running up your back...that!), and at the last sentence the conductor dramatically raises his baton...."], ["[4.. maybe a 3.75 stars]So if I need to describe this first book in 2 words I would say: Original and ClinicalOriginal, because let's be honest it's nothing like other fantasy novels I've read, the magic system is about capturing \"ideas\" into humanoid forms called \"Andat\" and control them to do the bidding of the castor, however these forms develop somewhat human traits and emotions as well, cue instant interesting and favorite character! The world building is also very engaging with a lot of oriental and Asian influences (can we take a second to appreciate those beautiful covers?! Kudos to Stephanie Martiniere).The plot is politics and economy-heavy which and completely action-free, which you don't see much of, if ever, in fantasy. This could be a big hit or miss for readers as the plot can be very slow-paced at times (cue audiobook to speed things up!), I won't call it slow-burn for now because that implies that they are great things to happen and I don't know that yet. However, this series seems like one that only gets better and better with each book, so look forward for 3 more reviews!Why clinical? Well you'd think the slow-nothing-is-happening pace is the reason of the low-ish rating I gave, I actually like well done slow-burn books *cough*RobinHobb*cough*. This one though was kind of a miss regarding the presentation of the characters. Don't get me wrong they are all interesting and engaging to read about, Otah and Seedless are my absolute favorite, Amat is a middle aged woman who is a BAMF that gets shit done and Maati is a precious child that you want to smack every once in a while and hug the rest of the time, Liat can go expire in a ditch for all I care but she is a very realistic 17 years old girl. Not to mention a plethora of other rich charatersSo all of the above had great distinct characterization, but I just wasn't attached to any of them. We would get description of all these horrible things that happened to them and I'm like too bad bro..So that was a bit disappointing for someone like me who likes to get destroyed and left traumatized after finishing a book..So all in all, I recommend this book for someone who is bored with all the mainstream fantasy and would like to experience something new. I am DEFINITELY going to continue with the series because ANDATS! and because I really really liked the world and I am hopefully that my attachment issues with the characters will improve as the series advances.Buddy Read with  my best-book-friend Petrik who always tries to keep me sane when I\u2019m in full geek-out mode :\u2019D"], ["I really liked the writing and the concept of \"poets\" giving literal shape and form to ideas.

It is lavishly illustrated with watercolour paintings by the Australian artist, Robert Ingpen. This is a happy combination, as Ingpen's depictions, based on Australian flora, seem to be a perfect fit for Lear's imagined Bong-tree Land. Edward Lear was one of 20 children. He suffered from epilepsy, and had a very unhappy childhood as an unwanted member of the family. He was largely brought up by an elder sister who encouraged him to develop his artistic talent. Interestingly, Sarah, another sister of his, was also a talented artist and writer, though she is largely forgotten now. This edition of the book is dedicated to her memory. It includes seven of Edward Lear's most popular poems:The Owl and the PussycatThe JumbliesThe Dong with a Luminous NoseThe New VestmentsThe Duck and the KangarooCalico Pie and How Pleasant to Know Mr. LearIt is perfectly possible to read Lear's verse in a standard collection of poetry, as words on the page without the aid of pictures. Perhaps this is how most of us remember reading him in childhood. Or perhaps you may remember them being read aloud, as hearing them aloud benefits the language enormously. I would defy anyone not to \"hear\" them in their head as they read. But there is another consideration with this particular book.For those adults - and some children - who find Lear's eccentric descriptions all but impossible to visualise, these illustrations are not only very attractive but also a great help with interpretation. Lear's sing-song language is easy and repetitive, the sound of his verse and his imagery will delight young children, yet his ideas are sometimes so ludicrous as to be unimaginable. Can you see a \"runcible spoon\" in your mind's eye? Or \"The Dong with a Luminous Nose\"? I couldn't - even though in this case Lear gives a detailed description of him - until I looked at the illustrations.\"Far and few, far and fewAre the lands where the Jumblies live;Their heads are green and their hands are blue,And they went to sea in a Sieve.\"We first hear this refrain in \"The Jumblies\", and it is then echoed in \"The Dong with a Luminous Nose\", a poignant and mournful verse. Sad though it is, it is probably my personal favourite. Perhaps though, it is as well that it is followed by \"The New Vestments\"; such a silly piece of nonsense that it makes the reader laugh out loud. And small children will love the \"rude\" and funny picture in this book. \"How Pleasant to Know Mr. LearWho has written such volumes of stuff!Some think him ill-tempered and queer,But a few think him pleasant enough.\"So where on earth did he get his odd ideas? What made him juxtapose such ridiculous items to make a more-or-less coherent whole? The answer seem to be that, in common with many comedians throughout history, he was trying to escape his own unhappiness. He started out as a draughtsman for the Zoological Society of London, making drawings of rare birds and animals. Some of his beautiful bird paintings from this time are included in the books. He entertained his employer's children with his drawings and invented nonsense rhymes, to which they showed, \"uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.\" Imagine how welcome such approval must have been to a young man who had sadly experienced little of this in his life to date. He went on to travel throughout Europe, writing and illustrating guides to various places, and these came to the attention of Queen Victoria. She was so impressed that she promptly employed Edward Lear as her drawing master. In 1870 he published his most famous poem, The Owl and the Pussycat, with which he found his perfect niche. To the end of his days he commented on the world around him in a nonsensical style, referring most revealingly once to, \"This ludicrously whirlygig life which one suffers from first and laughs at afterwards.\"Even writing what amounts to his own obituary, with a letter sent to a friend shortly before his travels, he ends it, typically,\"Oh bother!\" The text of the letter is included in the book, as is a short biography of the author. Additionally there are contributions by the illustrator, Robert Ingpen. He has written a two-page botanical study entitled \"Bong-tree land\", styled very much in the tradition of the time, plus another two pages about Bong-tree Land itself, reading rather like a nonsensical travel guide, starting,\"Visitors to Bong-tree land must be prepared to travel by sea for a year and a day from almost any port in England.\"Robert Ingpen has captured the essence and style of Edward Lear very nicely, and this provides an unexpected extra tribute to the author. Edward Lear has influenced a host of writers and comedians ever since, including Gilbert and Sullivan, A. A. Milne, Spike Milligan, The Goons, Dr. Seuss and Monty Python's Flying Circus. If you have a penchant for the ridiculous, don't make the mistake of thinking him outdated, and pass Edward Lear by - give him a try. Perhaps he wrote his own epitaph with the words,\"Nonsense is the breath of my nostrils.\""], ["We recently read Miss Smith Under the Ocean, which references a lot of classic tales.

Both are stream-of-consciousness narratives with the air of a self-eulogy by the author. Both make use of very graphic, descriptive language (although Hemingway uses his rare adjectives on food and drink, while Miller lavishes descriptions on landscapes and people), and both are weighted heavily with character studies. But, despite all Miller's seeming disdain for his peers (he derides Hemingway and Steinbeck repeatedly in Big Sur), Hemingway is the better writer by far. Hemingway uses words sparsely and places them with precision, constructing beautiful sentences that describe people, places, and things effectively enough to provoke the reader's mind, yet lightly enough that the reader's imagination can play. Miller, however, falls into the Pynchon trap, seeming to write directly from his own mind - which is perfectly legitimate for first-draft material, but Miller also seems allergic to editing. As a result, the reader must put himself in the author's mental state as it was during the writing process in order to understand what Miller wishes to say. If good writing is defined as effective communication, Henry Miller is not a good writer.Miller is pedantic, intolerant, angry, hypocritical, and unstable bordering on insane. He alternately rants and raves as the pages flow, seeming to forget what he said in the last paragraph in order to make a new (sometimes relevant, usually irrelevant, sometimes contradictory) point in the next. But despite all this, Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymous Bosch is worth reading. If the reader is patient enough to separate the wheat from the chaff, he will find several very engaging ideas about life, politics, nature, religion, and child-rearing - among other topics - buried in Miller's ravings... true gems in the mud."], ["After Greece, the years spent by Miller in the wilderness of Big Sur.Rudimentarily installed in 1940 on his return from Greece, on the wild coast of Big Sur in California, narrow strip of barren and beautiful land located between cliffs and mountains, far away from \"civilization\", there lives a simple, austere and often difficult life, along with exceptional every neighbors in some aspects...The story of this life, its hardness and its pleasures, visits from friends, strangers and intruders, for better and for worse, between education problems of children and watercolorist complex pleasures, itself constitutes a \"lesson\", littered with exposed more theoretical digressions, which find their beautiful consistency over these 400 pages...A book that resonates extensively in the heart and in the mind of the reader...\"(..)There are no ruins or relics which we can realize. No history that we can discuss. Face of what has always been. Nature smiled into the mirror of eternity.Far away down there, seals bask on the rocks, squirming like large worms brown. And overlooking the roar of the waves on the surf can be heard barking hoarse for kilometers.\""], ["The final part makes this a great book - the Devil in Paradise recounting of Henry Miller's relationship with Conrad Moricand, fascinating in itself but also somewhat illuminating as the Miller's own character flaws and hypocrisies. It's a famously savage rendering of a ridiculous French dandy who simply cannot cope in a world which does not revolve around serving his fine sensibilities. It would be easy to see Moricand as a fool, an example of all that was once pathetic and hopeless about the French aristocratic temperament which once filtered down through several strata of French - or rather Parisian - society. I can only surmise that, in spite of his professed Francopilia, Miller would be relieved to know that Paris has now been considerable ungentrified, and considerably Americanised, albeit in a way which seems to leave its occupants awkward and confused about what precisely their role in the world is. There's moments of wisdom mixed in with the duller character portrayals earlier in the book, and gentle attempts to convince perhaps himself, perhaps the world, of the decency to be found in the proto-hippy community at Big Sur. Like so many middle-aged men of intelligence, Miller has escaped the soi-disant air-conditioned nightmare through religions of the east - something which always makes me wary in western men. And, inevitably, his appreciation of the thoughts of Krishnarama and so on become something of a fortress to reinforce his sense of having struggled, survived and maintained himself. I can't really decide whether Miller's glorification of his working class intelligence and toughness or Moricand's glorification of talcum powder is more absurd. It seems strange that he would defend so vigorously the American values which make life culturally tougher for, say, the French, and attack viciously the American values which make like comfortably easier for Americans. By the end I sympathised with Moricand more than Miller, simply because he is more of an anomaly now than ever, and he was pretty anomalous even then. There were limits to Henry Miller's patience, and he never fully escaped the protestant Anglo-German moral foundry, and as is typical it was made hypocritical with the introduction of 'eastern' thought into the mix - the mess of individualism, relative comfort, self-actualisation, mindfulness, and never ending morality, or in other words everything Moricand could never be. The honesty of the text cannot have been accidental, and I can't believe Henry Miller was oblivious to how vulnerable he was making himself appear in publishing such a brutal assessment of his life with a man he chose to call a friend, whom he brought to the land of over promise, under deliver from the land which is the very opposite of that."], ["I thought this was fabulous. It's not your usual memoir reading. It rambles and diverges and surfs the content of his life in that Henry Miller kind of way. It took him awhile to perfect his style starting with the Tropic of Cancer. At least for me. With all its free association prose and occasional wild sexual language, the Tropic of Cancer can be tough to follow. But by the time he wrote Big Sur he'd made writing seem rather effortless. His thoughts and his pen seem to be one and the same. It's an account of an artist getting older, living on the edge of a rugged coast line. And I love when he throws in a name or two to keep you alert. He'll casually say, in his story of raising his two kids in a bungalow on Partington Ridge in Big Sur, how it was always a treat when Buster Keaton would come up from Hollywood and entertain the children, doing slapstick routines all evening in their little, living room. Miller was a pioneer in alternative lifestyle living, even if it was mostly on a shoestring budget. And of course the backdrop to his impressions is Big Sur. The kind of place that can drive anyone into personal, artistic genius and/or mad hattery."], ["One of my favorite books. This was my introduction to Henry Miller and so far my favorite. By this point in his life he had figured life out so to speak. He understood what is important and how to live a peaceful enjoyable life. A stark contrast from his early yearly of ramble rousing. Perhaps it took just that in his early life along with the misery of city life to bring him to this understanding and appreciation for the \"good life\" in Big Sur. And when reading this book, I kept finding myself agreeing with him- \"Yes, that is what its all about!\" The book takes a somewhat odd turn towards the end with the horrific house guest he takes in. Here, I wanted to grab Millers shoulders and shake him out of his kind stupor- \"Get that freak out of your home!\" Anyway, it all made for an interesting read. I rarely read books a second time but this is one I will go back to over and over. Miller is a modern day prophet and I appreciate his wisdom."], ["This book, about Henry Miller's life at Big Sur, is a mixed bag. Some of the character sketches are very good, and some are not at all. When Miller wrote about his benefactor Jean Wharton, for instance, I nearly put down the book because of how barf-y and supplicating it was. Miller is always good for a few poignant thoughts though, and consistently does a great job when raking someone over the coals.Here was one passage I underlined:\"The most difficult thing to adjust to, apparently, is peace and contentment. As long as there is something to fight, people seem able to brave all manner of hardships. Remove the element of struggle, and they are like fish out of water. Those who no longer have anything to worry about will, in desperation, often take on the burdens of the world. This not through idealism but because they must have something to do, or at least something to talk about.\""], ["Henry, you old rascal, you finally figured out the whole deal.

He's middle-aged, divorced, poverty-stricken (because of the divorce) and living in a crappy hotel room. He's not particularly attractive and has little luck with women. (Did I mention that he wears dentures which he seems to be losing all too often?) Still, for all that, he's a very sympathetic character and you can't help rooting for the guy.As the book opens, an ex-con named Junior Frenger arrives at Miami International. Junior is a psychopath with big ambitions and as he's walking through the airport, he accidentally kills a Hare Krishna who has annoyed him. Junior steals some luggage, checks into a hotel and makes a date with a hooker. The hooker turns out to be a fairly spacey community college student named Suzie Waggoner who immediately falls for Junior's line of B.S. and moves in with him.Hoke Moseley is assigned the murder case and manages to track down Suzie and Junior whom he suspects of the crime.

All I\u2019ve had is trouble of some kind or other ever since I came down here. What I\u2019d say, if you asked me about Miami, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a good place for a single girl to be.Susan Waggoner has reasons aplenty to complain. She\u2019s barely in her twenties, and she\u2019s already a runaway from her small town in the Glades, has been abused by her own brother, had an abortion followed by a budding career in prostitution. And that\u2019s all before she gets caught in a deadly game between Miami Police Sergeant Hoke Moseley and a ruthless criminal just landed from California: Frederick J Frenger, who prefered to be called Junior instead of Freddy, was twenty-eight years old. He looked older because his life had been a hard one; the lines at the corners of his mouth seemed too deep for a man in his late twenties. His eyes were a dark shade of blue, and his untrimmed blond eyebrows were almost white. His nose had been broken and reset poorly, but some women considered him attractive. His skin was unblemished and deeply tanned from long afternoons spent in the yard at San Quentin. At five-nine, he should have had a slighter build, but prolonged sessions with weights, pumping iron in the yard, as well as playing handball, had built up his chest, shoulders, and arms to almost grotesque proportions. He had developed his stomach muscles to the point that he could stand, arms akimbo, and roll them in waves. I have chosen this long passage for two reasons : first, the novel spends much more time inside the insane head of Freddy than in the company of Hoke Moseley (this is not a spoiler, and no mystery actually, since we are following the events as they develop and not investigating them after the murder); and secondly, I really like the style of presentation, hard edged but with the occasional flash of black humour, eminently readable (that\u2019s why the term page turner was invented). Willeford knows best how to fade in the background and let his characters determine the dialogue and the style of presentation.Freddy is also the reason I didn\u2019t add the final star to my review: he is well constructed, for a psychopat, but I disliked him intensely right from the start, with his casual atitude towards violence and total disregard for other people\u2019s property. He feels entitled to grab everything he can, seeing himself as a wolf among sheep. He is completely self-absorbed and ready to use his new girlfriend (Susan) both as a sex toy (\u201cplatonic marriage\u201d means something else than what I learned in school for Freddy) and as his criminal accomplice. \u201cYou use that word a lot.\u201d\u201cWhat word?\u201d\u201c \u2018Fair\u2019. Now that you\u2019re twenty years old \u2013 \u201c\u201cOnly by one month \u2013 \u201c\u201c- you\u2019d better forget about things like \u2018fair\u2019 and \u2018unfair\u2019. Even when people talk about the weather, \u2018fair\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d In the opposite corner sits Hoke Moseley, an experienced criminal investigator cut from the same cloth as the classic hard-boiled gumshoes: divorced, alcoholic, cynical, heavy fisted. He\u2019s got the blues big time, justifying the title of this first installment in the series dedicated to him. Any way he looked at it, it was a rotten business.  may refer both to the current affair and to his life in general, who is not satisfied to kick him in the teeth, but goes on to stamp on them, throw them out windows and steal them ( it\u2019s a sort of running joke in the book with his false dentures)The third main actor in the drama is the city of Miami, called in one of the opening scenes \u201cthe original Sin City\u201d, where shop owners are not satisfied with safe boxes and secure windows,(view spoiler)[ but keep a gunman handy in the back room (hide spoiler)], pimps and drug dealers rule the streets and the police feel naked without their guns. Hoke exclaims at one point: It really feels funny as hell driving and walking around Miami without a weapon. By the end, there is too thin a line between the cops and the robbers, with Freddy getting in trouble for finally trying to help a shop owner, and Hoke turning vigilante in his quest to catch up and exact revenge on him. And this amalgam of dark grey tones instead of black and white sharp contrast is probably one more reason why the novel stands above the usual fare in crime thrillers. My last quote is a bitter reminder that the people we trust to keep order and peace are much to often ready to tamper with the evidence in order to \u2018help\u2019 a colleague in trouble: You\u2019re in some jurisdictional trouble if you don\u2019t get your story straight.

Time will tell though and she will soon taste the end of his whip and as some dark harrowing truths come to light she have to do some mighty quick intelligent thinking.You are put through the eyes of Freddy more than the first appearance of homicide detective Hoke Moseley.Hoke can be brutal when needed but looks to be an interesting detective to read more of in the other novels where Charles Willeford features him as a main protagonist.The dialogue and writing is sharp, the story cuts to the chase there is some deadpan dark humour in the mix and all these blends of style provides entertaining reading through one dark side of Miami with ex-con Freddy 'Junior.'\"Perhaps Freddy has been too pessimistic about his life. He had figured, for as long as he could remember, that someday he would end up in prison for life, wandering around the yard as an old lag, muttering into a white beard and sniping cigarette butts.But that didn't have to be - not if he could plan and execute one big job. Just one big haul...But nothing came to him. He had no concrete ideas except for germ, and the germ was that he had Sergeant Hoke Moseley's badge and ID. The badge was an automatic pass to free food and public transportation; it could also be used to bluff someone out of considerable sum of cash. But who?\""], ["Charles Willeford's Hoke Moseley series starts off with a bang, it's a strange and twisted and outrageously funny at times bang too. His protagonist is a strange beast of a detective with all kinds of odd quirks and is a supporting character to the newly released criminal who spends the entire novel compulsively lying and cheating and making some of the craziest decisions you might expect to find in an Elmore Leonard criminal farce.Willeford packs out the cast with some wonderfully drawn characters who feel completely authentic to the time and place (whether they are or not I will obviously never know having not lived in Miami in the early 80s) and despite the existential nature of the two leads the supporting cast are used to great comic effect. My personal favourite being the jaded college tutor who abuses his pathetic students to their face and readily admits to preparing for his lectures in a nearby bar.With Miami Blues I have discovered has a unique voice in the noir field, different even to Willeford's earlier pulp novels, from the first page he had me grinning and despite some lag in pacing towards the middle this is clearly the work of an author with a lifetime of experience under his belt."], ["After landing in Miami, Freddy Frenger Jr. (or Junior as he prefers to be called) steals three wallets and begins to plan his new life. While leaving the airport he snatches a suitcase and leaves a corpse of a Hare Krishna behind. Detective Hoke Moseley is on the case; chasing Junior and his new hooker girlfriend through luxury hotels and the suburban streets of Miami.If this sounds really familiar then you\u2019ve probably seen the 1990 movie of the same name starring Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh. While there are some major differences to the two, the majority of the book is exactly the same. I\u2019m a little disappointed when I found out this was the first in the Hoke Moseley series, because I always thought of the detective as a supporting role. In the movie Junior steals Moseley\u2019s badge and starts pretending to be a cop to con people; this was the best part of the movie. Sadly in the book there isn\u2019t much of that going on.Charlies Williford is an author of fiction, poetry, an autobiography, and literary criticism but he is best known for his hard-boiled writing. I think it is weird that he was a poet and literary critic as well as pulp writer, but then again I really shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s just an interesting fact about the author. When you think 1980\u2019s hard-boiled novels, Miami Blues is probably going to be one of the top nominations on that list. Charlies Williford was such a prolific writer, with over forty novels published, it is kind of sad that he is best known for the Hoke Moseley series that he wrote very late in his life. I wonder what some of his other books were like, there seems to be a whole lot of hard-boiled novels in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s that look interesting.This book is an example of the noir sub-genre Florida glare which is basically a crime novel set in Florida where the heat and the culture play a role in the story as well. Noir is typically associated to LA and there have been some writers out there that wanted to depict Florida as the perfect location for crime stories as well. Some examples of this include the Travis McGee (by John D. MacDonald), Jack Ryan (by Elmore Leonard), and Dexter Morgan (by Jeff Lindsay) series and I\u2019m sure many more. It is an interesting concept though do we really need another genre? I like how the heat of Florida plays a part in the book and the environment is almost like a supporting character.This was a quick read and one of the rare cases where I think I prefer the movie over the book. I wonder if there are any more noir novels where a character pretends to be a cop in order to con people; I\u2019m sure there are plenty out there, I like the concept and would like to read more of them. I think I\u2019ll have to try another Charlies Williford, maybe something earlier. Does anyone want to recommend me a good Charlies Williford novel?This review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/..."], ["This book by Charles Willeford (along with The Friends of Eddie Coyle by George V. Higgins) is the basis of the great crime fiction of Elmore Leonard. He was heavily influenced by these two authors and it shows. This is not to say that Leonard copied the style \u2013 instead he has improved upon the approach to writing that these authors have themselves mastered.In Miami Blues, the reader spends just as much time with the bad guy as the good guy (maybe even more time..) and he seems like a real person, not just a criminal to be arrested by the police. We spend time with this antagonist, Freddy the psychopathic ex-con, and learn about his motivations, his likes, dislikes, worries, etc. You\u2019ll see the roots of Leonard when you read this book.The \u201cgood guy\u201d cop Hoke a unique denture-wearing guy who is sympathetic yet slightly stand-offish. You don\u2019t learn to love him but you like him as well as feel bad for him. He\u2019s not overly macho and therefore he seems all the more real for that.Some of the language and references are dated and there some racist/homophobic/sexist language that may turn off some readers. However, that language is put there to show the attitudes of people you\u2019d meet everyday. It\u2019s a frank and honest portrayal of real people. The plot relies on a far-fetched coincidence but it\u2019s not too distracting. There\u2019s some pretty brutal scenes in here, too, so fans of violent crime fiction will love it. Even though the roots of Elmore Leonard lie in the fiction of Willeford and Higgins, I think Leonard has improved upon that style, tightening up the writing and making it more laid-back (and more fast-paced, if that makes sense). There is also some humor in Miami Blues, some of it quite funny (the \u201cCrisco\u201d part is pretty hilarious). So, if you like good crime fiction that isn\u2019t a \u201cwhodunit\u201d, read this book. If you like Elmore Leonard, read this book. And for Tarantino fans, QT has also name-dropped Willeford as an influence so if that gets you excited, read this book."], ["Note sure I appreciate a vicious psychopath carrying the name Freddy, but he does and, as the girl he never got around to killing notes \"He does have his good points.\" Book is an interesting time warp, seeing Miami in the 80s with reference on one page to Woolworths, Burdines, and Eckerd Drugs which no longer grace the Florida retail scene, constant smoking anywhere and everywhere by most of the characters, police officers needing to borrow a phone on scene to report in, etc. The story is interesting, if unusual. Short and not so sweet with a most unusual \"hero\", a cop living in a broken down flophouse style hotel, deeply in debt due to a divorce and unable to make much headway as the daughters need braces, and he needing to get his dentures replaced,etc. (Note those dentures play an interesting role in the narrative.) Not sure why the author needed to keep mentioning prices unless it was to tie it to the time period. Still, one of my more interesting reads lately."], ["Well written & an entertaining read. Just not AMAZING!I'll likely read the other 4 books in this series, but I'm in no hurry to do so.

Instead of a partner or a sidekick, Rutledge has only the ghostly specter of a dead colleague and brother-in-arms, Hamish McCleod, to help him sort out the details. Smart and original."], ["All of the books by Charles Todd are a pleasant read with nice accurate tie-ins to the post World War I period in England, including the transitional difficulties to civilian life of the main character, Inspector Rutledge, and others who survived the war. Rutledge's transition is more difficult because he has no visible wounds, but suffers from what is now recognized as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.In this particular installment, the author (Charles Todd is actually a mother-son writing team) once again makes post World War I a substantive part of the mystery. There are two separate threads in the story: both of the mystery of who is stalking the Inspector, and the main story which is the attack on the local Inspector, a long-missing teenager, and the mystery of Firth's Woods.If you enjoy 20th century accurate historical fiction as well as mysteries this series will be enjoyable to you."], ["This is the eighth adventure of Ian Rutledge, a \u201cshell-shocked\u201d World War I veteran, back at his pre-war job at Scotland Yard, investigating and solving murders. (The books take place in 1919.) Ian is also haunted \u2013 literally- by the ghost of a Scottish soldier who reported to him during his time in the trenches. Hamish \u2013 said ghost \u2013 is not just an ephemeral lurking presence but a constant character. After eight books, Hamish has become more than tiresome; he\u2019s aggravating, much a like a neighbor\u2019s barking dog. In addition this series has become both stale and repetitive.The authors \u2013 I use the plural, as Charles Todd is actually a mother/son duo \u2013 follow a very similar outline for each of the Rutledge books. Although Ian is based in London, he spends little time there. His superior, a one dimensional bureaucrat and blowhard, assigns Rutledge to cases out in the English countryside. This is perfectly fine with the loner Ian, who hops into his \u201cmotor-car\u201d and travels to some distant small village or hamlet to solve a murder. When Ian reaches his destination he is always greeted with suspicion by the small-town folk, he drinks copious amounts of tea and sleeps little; he encounters a very obvious red-herring, i.e. a member of the community who must be guilty except he or she is not because that would be too obvious. And there is always a woman \u2013 usually a young widow \u2013 who kindles a romantic spark within Ian. Rutledge always solves the case just before he can truly fall in love and just in time for his superior to assign him to another case in another remote location. And oh yeah, there\u2019s always Hamish the Obnoxious Ghost, yammering in his impenetrable Scottish burr in the not so distant background.A Long Shadow follows this template. It differs from its predecessors in that the solution of the case \u2013 actually cases \u2013 is incredibly weak, particularly the identity of the murderer. Also Rutledge has attracted a stalker in this book, the point of which I missed.I was drawn to this series because it has all the earmarks I usually enjoy. Unfortunately to say the Rutledge books are similar is an understatement. They\u2019re all the same book. If you\u2019ve read one, you\u2019ve read them all."], ["I love Inspector Rutledge! I feel so sorry for him and wish he could find peace and a woman to love. Only thing is, when he does find peace and Hamish is gone, then the series will most likely be over, and I don't know if I want that."], ["Perhaps someone other than me can explain how a story that has very little action, populated by post WW I Brits, and whose protagonist carries someone he was forced to execute in his head can transfix me from start to finish. Must be the writing, right?The irony is that the author(s), a mother and son team are Americans and live in different cities. Must be empathy and telepathy, right?Whatever it is, they authored an outstanding mystery in this volume, the 8th in the Inspector Rutledge Series. Rutledge is dispatched by his enemy, Superintendent Bowles, to investigate the wounding by an arrow of Constable Hensley, an ex-London Bobbie, now posted to Dudlington, a very small village North of London. As he works the case he uncovers a number of unsolved disappearances that only he sees as possibly connected to Hensley's attack in the Firth Forest, a forbidding thicket outside of town, usually avoided by the locals.Eventually we meet most of the people in the town, almost all of whom, resent Rutledge's very presence to say nothing of his inquiries. The characterizations are very well done. Not everyone dislikes Rutledge. He befriends the local Doctor and Rector and gets on well with Hensley's superiors.There is also a sub-plot involving the mysterious appearance of Maxim machine gun cartridges and Rutledge's feeling he is being shadowed. In the end, Rutledge, solves the mystery in a surprising conclusion and finds the guilty party in the disappearances. He also finally meets the person who's been leaving the cartridges as he is winding up the Hensley case and the disappearances. The finale is complicated but satisfying. I can hardly wait to get to volume 9."], ["My least favorite in the series thus far. Right off the bat, two negatives. A storyline which seemingly involved a spiritualist. Thank heavens, she did it more as a lark and the story wasn't bogged down in mysticism. The second disappointment. Any hopes of a developing relationship between Ian and Elizabeth Fraser are shot to pieces in the first scenes with Rutledge. Either give him a love interest or don't. Quit with the teasing! And if that's not enough, the very ending also shoots any lingering hopes with Elizabeth right out of the water. Boo!And from the excerpt on the book jacket, I thought Frances was going to play a bigger part in the story. Another disappointment. I just did not enjoy the mystery at all. Either of them. Rutledge seemed to be bumbling along, completely clueless. The one thing which might have saved this particular book was if he had found evidence to implicate Bowles in some wrongdoing, but even that proved a disappointment. I certainly hope the next book is better and a little more creative. The Bess Crawford series seems to be more nuanced, whereas Ian Rutledge has grown a little too formulaic. I'd like to see some growth or healing or something here. Have Ian do something which will surprise me instead of the same old thing."], ["This is the first of the Inspector Ian Rutledge books I have read and, although I liked it, I think I should have read the ones preceding it to get an overall understanding of the main character. Throughout the book, Inspector Ian Rutledge, tormented by his time in the trenches in WWI, holds conversations with the spirit of Hamish (who I assume was his batman) who died in that war....but circumstances surrounding his death are sketchy and appear to be somehow the fault of Rutledge. That may be have been explained in the earlier books.That aside, the story is well done as Rutledge finds an engraved cartridge casing identical to the ones he saw in the war......and when others appear, he wonders if he is being stalked. He is then sent to an isolated village to investigate the shooting of a constable with an arrow (!) and finds himself involved in more than he bargained for.....and the cartridges continue to show up. There are plots within plots and are all tied together rather tidily in the end.

He has returned to his position at Scotland Yard where he investigates murders.

First, who is stalking Rutledge? Second, what happened to a missing teenager who disappeared? The locals believe that she is buried in Firth's Woods, a dense, depressingly thick and dark area that people avoid because of tales about ghost hauntings. In reality, the Inspector has been sent to investigate an attack on another policeman who is critically injured in the woods. Somehow though, he feels, the cold case about the missing girl may be part of it. Thus, Rutledge needs to discover not just who tried to kill the policeman but also what happened to the missing girl and who is stalking him. In essense, Rutledge finds himself in a most complex situation that unfolds layer by layer as his investigation proceeds."], ["After reading the previous book in this series, A Cold Treachery, I was interested to see where Inspector Ian Rutledge's cases would take him next and I decided to jump right in and read the next book in the series. After all, it was already on my Kindle waiting for me, just a click away.We first encounter the inspector here on New Year's Eve, 1919, only a short while after the end of his last case. He accompanies his sister, Frances, to the house of mutual friends for a dinner party. At the party, one of the guests is alleged to have some psychic powers and she is asked to hold a seance, an activity that is very popular in the London of the day. This makes Inspector Rutledge, who has an intimate knowledge of and relationship with the dead from the recent war, very uncomfortable, and he is relieved to receive a phone call from Scotland Yard which gives him an excuse to leave.As he is leaving, he finds a brass cartridge casing on the steps outside. He picks it up and sees that there is an engraving on it. He puts it in his pocket and goes on his way, but soon he's finding other such engraved casings. Someone seems to be following him around and leaving the casings for him to find. For a man already on the knife's edge of mental collapse because of PTSD, this seems a deliberate attempt to unsettle and threaten him. Mercifully, he is called away from London to a small Northamptonshire village where the local constable has been shot and seriously wounded by a bow and arrow, while in woods that the locals consider to be haunted. Trying to find out what has happened proves difficult for Rutledge because the local folk are extremely taciturn and close-mouthed.Rutledge learns that there are other mysteries which the villagers seem intent on hiding for some reason. For example, a teenage girl disappeared from the village some three years earlier and has never been found. Her grandmother, with whom she lived, says she must have gone to London to look for her missing mother. But did she? And was the constable looking for her grave in the woods when he was shot?It soon becomes apparent to Rutledge that there is a connection between the missing girl and the wounded constable, but just what that connection is is not at all clear. Meanwhile, distressingly, Rutledge continues to find engraved cartridge casings in odd places and then while he is out in his motorcar one day, a bullet smashes his windscreen, barely missing his head. Who is this unknown adversary who appears to be stalking him? To complicate the situation further, the psychic from the New Year's Eve party shows up in the village and expresses concern about Rutledge, but is her concern genuine or is she somehow connected to the stalker?In order to solve the mysteries, Rutledge must find a way to break the silence of this unfriendly and secretive village and he must find the motive behind the disappearance of the teenager and the wounding of the constable and discover the connection between the two.This is another eloquent story of suspense told in absorbing prose with an emotional depth that gives the reader a sense of Ian Rutledge as a very real and sympathetic, if flawed, character. He is a character that we can care about, one about which we can look forward to reading more."]], "review_count": "3", "description": "During the hottest days of the summer of 1863, while the nation's attention was focused on a small town in Pennsylvania known as Gettysburg, another momentous battle was being fought along the banks of the Mississippi.

Hoke, to put it mildly, does not remotely resemble the homicide detectives that one usually encounters in crime fiction. Certainly, he\u2019s nothing like Sonny Crockett and the other detectives of the television show, Miami Vice, which was so wildly popular at the same time this series was written.Hoke is middle-aged and overweight; he dresses in leisure suits that be buys on the cheap. He has no teeth and is plagued by an ill-fitting set of dentures that constantly cause him problems. He lives in a small home that he shares with his two teenage daughters, the woman who was once his partner, and the ex-partner\u2019s infant son. Hoke and his ex-partner are not romantically involved; they are both challenged financially and are sharing the house as a way of saving money. It\u2019s a difficult arrangement which severely limits Hoke\u2019s sex life, assuming that he had one. Obviously, it\u2019s nothing like living alone on a great bachelor-pad houseboat with an alligator named Elvis.Hoke is now working cold cases and is pursuing the case of a doctor who was murdered several years ago. He\u2019s enjoying the challenge and is reasonably content until a man named Donald Hutton leases the house directly across the street. Years earlier, Hoke had arrested Hutton for first-degree murder. On the basis of the Hoke\u2019s testimony, Hutton was sentenced to life in prison and publicly swore revenge against Hoke. But then ten years down the road, the conviction was overturned on a technicality; Hutton was freed and the D.A. decided not to retry the case. So now Hutton is living across the street from Hoke, sitting out in the yard all day, watching the comings and goings of Hoke\u2019s daughters and his ex-partner, Ellita.Hoke is obviously concerned about Hutton\u2019s intentions, but there isn\u2019t much he can do about the situation. Then, in the middle of all this, his boss assigns him to a very dangerous, one-man undercover operation in a neighboring county. Haitian immigrants are disappearing and the local sheriff fears that a particularly nasty farmer is employing the Haitians as migrant labor and then killing them rather than paying them off at the end of the season. As a favor to the sheriff, Hoke\u2019s boss agrees to loan Hoke out to investigate.All of these diverse strands come together to create another very entertaining story. Willeford invented some truly unique characters; the story is well-plotted, and there\u2019s a fair amount of humor. The question that hangs over it all is whether Hoke will weather all the threats he suddenly faces to produce a solution to any of the crimes on his plate.Charles Willeford toiled in the crime fiction genre for a number of years without getting the attention and respect that he genuinely deserved. That changed, finally, when he began the Hoke Moseley series. The books were critically acclaimed and sold much better than his earlier efforts. Sadly, though, Willeford died in 1988, the same year that this book appeared and didn\u2019t get the chance to enjoy this success for very long. His passing was a loss for fans of crime fiction as well; it would have been great fun to follow Hoke Moseley through at least a few more books. But we are fortunate to have these four, and readers who haven\u2019t yet discovered Willeford and Hoke Moseley might want to look for Miami Blues, the book that introduced this great character."], ["I was hoping that Charles Willeford might be my post-Parker (I mean Richard Stark's Parker novels, not either of the two mystery authors with the past name Parker, neither of whom I've ever read) author but my first experience with the \"Master of Mystery\" wasn't very promising. A lot of people seem to like Willeford an awful lot, and Donald Westlake, the name who when he's feeling dark puts on the hat of Richard Stark, praises Willeford as just about a bona fide genius in the genre. This makes me think that something is wrong with my judgment of the book. I just didn't think it was very good. Maybe it was a step ahead of the regular jaded / embittered detective out slogging through his job that appears to be a staple in the crime/mystery/hard boiled genre but it is barely a step ahead, not a leap or a bound or writing in a different ball-park altogether or whatever cliche would fit here. Why do I dislike the book?One, he irked me early on with gratuitous parentheses. There were only maybe three or four of them but they were totally unnecessary. This is the first one that annoyed me;Because of affirmative action, there were three Latins and two blacks ahead of him for promotion (all with much lower scores that Hoke's), but if the department ever did get around to promoting a white American to lieutenant again, Hoke would get the promotion.A couple of sentences above this one the reader is informed that \"he had passed the exam with a higher score than any other candidate in the department\". Obviously then every other candidate had a lower score and the information given in the parentheses is unnecessary and, well, sort of comes across as right wing whining. But politics aside it's unnecessary. Pointless. Cut it! (So says the person who writes whole paragraphs of unnecessary garbage into parentheses, but I like to think that when I do it I'm being annoying but also interjecting in a voice that doesn't flow right with the main rambling thread I'm on, like here where it's like I'm speaking to you as an aside, or so I think of it, but really it's more likely than not just an annoying affectation I picked up years ago when I was doing my zine and I was fascinated with the manner that Reverend N\u00f8rb wrote his columns in MRR and later added to the affectation by being less than subtle in my infatuation with the writing of DFW, and end parentheses). I could cite a few more examples but they are all about the same, usually with no embittered middle class white malice though. Two, the structure of the novel is awkward. Sub-plots get developed that then seem to just float away. Lead up in plots take forever and are then wrapped up with a swiftness that makes all the lead-up seem like overkill. I guess I could say that this is like real-life but as I have whined about in other reviews (like in my review for this book) but writing novels or any book or actually creating anything, is about choices. Is there a reason for a subplot to be there? Is there a reason to spend thirty or forty pages (which is roughly a seventh of the book) developing something that will just disappear with no mention at some point? I didn't get the feeling that there was a reason for the subplots disappearing, it felt lazy to me, not like it was making a statement about what life is like or pointing out the absurdity of everyday life or I don't know what. I shouldn't have to try to jerry-rig a rationalization for why more than a quarter of the book is plot that is left dangling if the author is going to point some path for me to move on. I can get behind DFW leaving major plots unresolved in a novel because it feels intentional, here it feels like the author had an idea he thought he'd run with and then forgot about it and didn't want to do a hatchet job on his novel and be left with something barely the length of a Harlequin Romance. On a similar point, there feels like an awful lot of filer in the book. Most of the filer comes in way too much detail about food. It's not important to know every detail of a meal, is there a reason the reader should care that he took one helping of a certain food and one of his daughters also did but the other one didn't? There is way too much space in this short novel given to meals. Three, too many plot points make no sense / the main character is an asshole. I don't need to like a main character in a book, but I don't like being presented with a total asshole but feel like I'm supposed to get behind him and think of him as one of the good guys. Hoke comes across as a close minded jerk most of the time, but then at other times lip service is paid to him as being a different type of person than the one that is presented. (view spoiler)[In the action climax to one of the main plots he kills two men who are suspected of murdering Haitian migrant workers. He has been sent undercover to see if he can find out anything about the two men but quickly they see through his thin disguise as a transient tramp and the boss tells the other guy to find out what the guys story is. The guy proceeds to punch Hoke in the ribs, throw him in some alfalfa, ask him his name and then tries to rape him (huh? really? Hey this guy might be a cop, lets not try to find out what his story is but lets rape him). Not wanting to be butt-fucked by a Mexican Hoke wraps some barbed wire around his hand and punches the guy in his one good eye, blinding him temporarily and then knocking him out with a two by four. While the guy is unconscious Hoke bashes in the guys head and kills him. We are told later he was doing the guy a favor since he only had one good eye he wouldn't be good for anything with the other one ruined by a barbed wire punch. Hoke then stalks after the other guy while not wearing any pants (what? the explanation that he is using the pants as a pad for his bruised ribs is weak, man up to the punch and put on some pants, no one fights well with their junk dangling around). He overtakes the other guy knocks him unconscious, does a piss poor job of tying him up or for checking to see if there are any guns near him and decides to find some pants, a shotgun and sit back and drink some Jack Daniels. The guy wakes up, finds a pistol at almost point blank range misses two shots at Hoke and then gets killed with a shotgun blast to the chest. Hoke, being a police officer, even if undercover, then decides to burn down the entire farm (why? No idea, but later on we find out that this is the kind of thinking the Miami Police Department is looking for in an Internal Affairs Lieutenant. This is what a 'good cop' would do? Bash in the brains of an unconscious suspect instead of, I don't know, taking him in to custody, interrogating him, not killing him in cold blood?  (hide spoiler)]Similarly, there was a scene where Hoke finds out that his daughters and friend are missing and he is a little disturbed by the news and vows in the morning to do some investigating but before he goes to bed that night he leaves his scuffed up shoes in front of his his youngest daughter's room so she can shine them for him if she happens to come home during the night. Dad of the year material! As I said I don't care if the characters in a book are assholes or psychopaths or whatever they turn out to be but don't present an asshole as a good guy, a regular guy who we can all get behind, which is what Hoke is feeling that Willeford gives to the character. I felt like I was supposed to feel sympathy for the plight of this Average Joe White Middle Class guy but in most everything he said and did he was just a close minded, complacent, vaguely racist, arrogant fuck who felt the whole world was against him when in reality he has little going on in his life that makes him any kind of victim. I would have liked to seen a few Mexican's, three or four Haitians, and his Jewish neighbor take turns beating the shit out of him with some brass knuckles and telling him now you're a victim you, stupid lazy fuck. Nothing I've mentioned above was by itself enough to sink a book for me, but it was all these little pet peeves of mine that made me feel very ehhh about the whole thing. I went in wanting to like it but instead of finding some kind of hard-boiled diamond I felt like I was reading a sloppy kind of pointless novel with some good moments of development that never paid off. Originally I rated this three stars, but I felt like there was something wrong with me for not liking the novel after some thought though I still think that I might just be missing something here but my overall enjoyment was on the negative side for this one."], ["Great title---one of the best interextual noir spins on another title ever, in fact. Every time I think of Trollope (or John W. Aldridge, who copped THE WAY WE LIVE NOW from Trol), I think of Willeford, in the same way I can't think of \"Stairway to Heaven\" without conjuring the B-H Sufers' \"Hairway to Steven.\" The novel itself is deceptively ramshackle. Subplots come and go, conflicts taper off, the prologue featuring the dastardly villain seems to have no relevance ... until, anyway, the hero is sent off on a secret undercover mission that involves a toothless henchman prodding what DeLillo would call his underworld. (No, the bad guys aren't TSA agents). The threat of homosexual rape that flushes through the bowels of noir gets a little tedious, but Willeford belonged to another generation in which that fear somehow clinched their masculinity precisely at the moment that they clenched. If the book seems a stroll rather than a beat-down, the knock-out uppercut comes in the final line, impeccably uttered by one of the hero's own daughters, which somehow manages to sum up every Hemingway-derived code hero ever created in a way that seems obvious and yet affecting. And what she says isn't \"I love you, Daddypaddles.\""], ["It's a crying shame that Charles Willeford went and died just as this series of Hoke Moseley novels was getting going. The Way We Die Now is the fourth and final chapter in Moseley's life on the Miami Police force in the 80s, and as usual you're treated to some fine existential musings, some witty commentary on the changing face of America and Moseley solving crimes in a largely straight forward manner.The book opens with a chapter describing two men killing animals and people, setting the scene for an anticipated investigation you might expect, only Willeford ignores it for the next hundred pages whilst you get reacquainted with his protagonist and get caught up wondering about his new ineffectual partner in homicide, his former partner now retired to be a single mother, positive discrimination within the police force, the influx of Pakistani immigrants to Hoke's neighbourhood and the underhanded manner in which the WASPs try to keep them out, how his two teenaged daughters cope with only Hoke as parent/role model and on and on until when the two killers finally reappear you've completely forgotten that you're reading a crime novel. It's really something and a very special entry in to the ranks of highly lauded crime novels.There's some unexpected and very matter of fact violence popping up in this one, the behaviour of Hoke causing the reader to completely reassess their opinion of him as an intelligent happy go lucky kind of guy with a strong line on doing what's right, to something a little darker perhaps. Oh, how I would have loved to have seen how Willeford developed that further."], ["Writers and readers are always bitching about the size of our to-be-read (TBR) piles.I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related to the fact that there\u2019s more books available, if they\u2019re easier to access electronically or via on-line bookstores like Booktopia, or whether social media means we just need something to talk about, to look busy, so hell, why not talk about how we\u2019ve just added another book to our TBR list.Whatever, the upshot is it\u2019s rare for many of us, well, for me anyway, to find ourselves in a situation where we don\u2019t actually have anything on hand to read and we need to find something quickly. A situation that necessitates departing from our planned reading list and taking a chance on whatever book we can find.This happened to me last week.I was in Queensland\u2019s Surfers Paradise for several days on personal business. I\u2019d finished the book I was reading, Dennis Lehane\u2019s excellent Live By Night, a lot quicker than I thought I would. I didn\u2019t have my Kindle or any other reading material with me and there was nothing in the house I was staying in.So I had to go out and find a book. Quickly.Now Surfers is not exactly book lover\u2019s paradise but it does have one or two okay second hand bookshops. In one of those I found a copy of Charles\u2019 Willeford\u2019s The Way We Die Now.I love Willeford and I\u2019ve read all the Hoke Moseley detective novels. So in that respect, I wasn\u2019t stepping too far out of my comfort zone. But it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve read them and I\u2019d forgotten just how good they are.Moseley is working cold cases for the Miami police when his commander gives him a special assignment, go to the south of Florida and find out who is murdering migrant Hispanic farm workers.He\u2019s living with his two daughters from his previous marriage and Ellita, his former Cuban female partner on the police force and her young baby. Moseley\u2019s got to juggle cold case leads, with his special assignment and bringing up his two daughters. To top it off, a man he convicted for murder has got out of jail and moved in across the street from his house.Willeford handling of all of this is masterful. He moves seamlessly between down and dirty action and Moseley\u2019s ruminations on the changing nature of Miami. His writing has a classic fifties pulp feel fused with an off beat hard boiled style.Moseley is a terrific character, a shabby, cheap skate, misanthropic, old school, right wing cop working in the increasingly multi-ethnic city of Miami in the eighties. He\u2019s the perfect anecdote to so many of the politically correct police appearing in crime fiction these days. Indeed, after reading The Way We Die Now, I think the Moseley books should be used in writing courses on the subject of how not to do a boring police procedural.On top of all this, it felt fitting reading the book in Surfers Paradise. The city took off in the late seventies as a prime destination for beach tourism and was modelled on aspects of Florida. Every second hotel and motel still seems to feature the words \u2018tropic\u2019, \u2018villa\u2019 \u2018palms\u2019 or \u2018casa\u2019 in its title.New Hope For the Dead was the fourth Moseley book. Willeford died the same year it was published, 1988. A great pity because, if this book was anything to go by, Willeford had plans for Moseley and the series felt like it had a lot more gas left in the tank.As a result of reading this, I\u2019m going to be dusting off and re-reading my other Willeford books. I\u2019ve also been inspired to find a good bio of the writer. Any suggestions would be very welcome.And I\u2019m going to be ignoring my TBR pile much more often."], ["Wow. I have a new definition of \"tragedy,\" now: The fact that Charles Willeford died just as this book was published in 1988, so he was never able to pen another one/Willeford, whom some credit with being the father of the modern Florida crime novel, led a wild life. He won a Purple Heart as a tank commander at the Battle of the Bulge, served in the military off and on for 20 years, studied art, taught creative writing, reviewed mysteries for the Miami Herald, and at various times worked as a flea-circus barker, a professional boxer, and an actor. He also wrote a series of bleak novels that included \"Pick-Up\" in 1955 and \"Cockfighter\" in 1962.And then, in 1984, his first book about a detective sergeant named Hoke Mosely was published, and things would never be quite the same. Mosely is a wonderful character -- a grizzled veteran of the Miami-Dade homicide squad prone to wearing leisure suits, making comments about every minority group imaginable and looking for angles to exploit to avoid paying any money for anything.Mosely is nothing if not practical -- to a fault. When his wife leaves him for a multimillionaire baseball player and dumps his two teenage daughters on him, he figures if he gives them a place to live and food to eat, he's done with his obligations. He spends little time giving them any sort of direction or instruction.The first book, \"Miami Blues,\" was almost an anti-detective story, and so were the subsequent sequels, \"New Hope for the Dead\" and \"Sideswipe.\" In fact, in \"Sideswipe,\" Hoke is almost an incidental character until the very end, where he helps save his Cuban-American partner, Elita, although she's wounded.Hoke solves his cases through hunches and sometimes just luck. Not everybody liked this approach. At one point, Willeford opened his mail to find a copy of \"Sideswipe\" with five bullet holes in it, accompanied by an anonymous note saying the reader had been robbed. \"A case could be made that Willeford isn`t a crime novelist at all, but rather an exceptionally gifted author who happens to write about life`s marginal characters,\" Chauncey Mabe wrote in the Sun-Sentinel in 1988.Yet the books were so popular that for \"The Way We Die Now,\" Willeford -- constantly plagued by hard luck when it came to publishers -- managed to get a $225,000 advance. It was worth every penny. In this book, Hoke actually manages to solve several murders, and works a bizarre undercover assignment that requires him to ditch his false teeth, badge and gun and pretend to be a farmworker in Immokalee. As always. Willeford's writing is vivid, his dialogue realistic and his sense of humor dark and twisted. His plotting is the real gift here, with a reader never knowing exactly which way the story is going to go next. There's a violent occurrence about halfway through that is just stunning. It proves just how practical -- and completely amoral -- Hoke can be when he's backed up against a wall.The ending, though, takes everything into a new direction -- Hoke's career and his living situation both, and left me wishing Hoke could have had more adventures, and maybe an opportunity to talk to Elita at least one more time.For more on Charles Willeford, here's a nicely done bio by someone who knew him: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/a......and here's the Chauncey Mabe interview with Willeford:http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988..."], ["I really, really tried to make this book last since it's the last of the Hoke Moseley books and as you know from my previous reviews, I've developed a little crush thing on the guy, but I couldn't put it down. I'm so sad to be done with it. Feels a little weird writing this review so soon. Body's still warm, etc. By this, the 4th book, I was starting to notice a pattern. And I don't mean that in a bad way. It was a pattern I liked: the first chapter obscurely references what will be the main crime of the book, then we get a bunch of Hoke being Hoke (making sandwiches, drinking Old Styles, being the best/worst dad ever), a side case for him to solve, a crazy awesome disgusting blood bath as the main crime plays out, and then a satisfying denouement, where Hoke is seemingly put out at first, but in the end things actually end up working out okay for him. But--slight spoilers--this was the first time that I actually sort of felt sad for Hoke at the end of the book. I might be projecting the sadness I feel about finishing the series, but I dunno, this one ended on a down note. Other notes: Hoke pees his pants again! See! I have to love this guy. Here is a list of words/names that appear in this book: cornhole, Vinnie Testeverde. Hoke milks a goat. Out of the four, Sideswipe might be my favorite. Oh, so there's also a 5th unpublished Hoke Moseley manuscript floating around called Grimhaven. But it's not actually a 5th book in the series. It's actually the second Hoke Moseley book. Willeford was told by his agent to turn his success off Miami Blues into a series, and Willeford wanted nothing of it so he wrote a big fuck-you sequel wherein Hoke does some horrendous, horrendous things. But his published wisely passed on it. Then I guess Willeford played ball and cannibalized the good parts of Grimhaven to create New Hope for the Dead, Sideswipe, and The Way We Die Now. Anyway, apparently you can read the manuscript in some library in Florida, or it's fairly easy to find a PDF of it online. I might do it."], ["Charles Willeford is considered 'hard-boiled' which is 'my genre' and I really liked this book more because it's set in Florida. South Florida but Florida nevertheless and I'm drawn to Florida books and writers. Sgt. Hoke Moseley, Miami PD, is THE Man. He's real, in part, because of Willeford's sparse writing. I love this character who had his teeth in the first of the series, lost them, bought some expensive 'chopper' then and lost them and can't afford to buy more on his police salary. A good thing his lost them because in this book he fits right in with the characters around him. And Moseley's funny without trying to be. I love to see humor surrounding so much choas and blending in just fine, thank you. Loads of action with some really dark scenes. But, that's my kindof book, my kind of writing, too. So glad I discovered Charles Willeford. He's my kindof guy, too."], ["Wow. Might become my favorite book in this series (aside from the brilliant first one), a hugely under-looked series of crime novels set in Florida. I always tell friends that reading Willeford is something like if Werner Herzog wrote noir fiction. Both amoral and almost humanistic, or at least psychologically astute. His books are also strange, surreal, often funny, always fascinating. Anyway, this is the fourth and last in his series of Hoke Moseley novels. They are all great and should be read in order. Plus, since no one knows of him, you can often find used first edition books of his for under five bucks. What are you waiting for?"], ["I thought this book was better than its three predecessors.

One slow afternoon, Florence Weintraub, the inevitable Hot Babe essential to the beginning of practically any classic P.I. story, waltzes into his office insisting that she's desperately in need of his help. Even though she's twenty-six years old, her father allows her absolutely no freedom whatsoever and has her accompanied wherever she goes by two goons who are allegedly there to protect her. She'd just like a couple of hours to herself, she says. Could Jake possibly help her lose the two thugs?Well, of course he can, for twenty-five bucks a day plus expenses. And when the lovely Florence agrees to the terms, one thing inevitably leads to another. Florence is very attracted to Jake and once they finally elude her guardians, they go out to dinner, which Jake naturally adds to the expense account. Other more interesting activities accompany the dinner, and Florence insists that she'd like to see Jake again the following day.Complications ensue and poor Jake soon finds himself entangled in a mess he never envisioned when he accepted Florence's seemingly simple assignment. It's an engaging story with plenty of Willeford's deadpan humor and enough action to propel the story forward at a fairly rapid clip. While not quite on a par with some of Willeford's better known books, it's still a fun read and will appeal especially to those who have read and enjoyed the author's other work."], ["Wild Wives begins with a beautiful, young femme fatale walking into a private detective's office. Sound familiar? Yep, it's a well-used, ordinary convention in hard-boiled detective fiction. But writer Charles Willeford is anything but ordinary. As he did in the last Willeford book I read, Pick-up, he turns the genre on it's head. In the first two pages of Wild Wives, we realize that the femme fatale is a 16-year-old girl, who shoots the detective with a water pistol, bends over his desk, and proceeds to ask him for a spanking.Thus begins this bizarre, sleazy little hard-boiled novella that has a hefty dose of sex and violence, not to mention a fitting title!"], ["This fast-paced novella is an unconventional private eye tale populated with seedy, greedy characters. Willeford, having written it under a pseudonym in 1956, rehashes the usual private-eye-falls-for-a-femme-fatale formula. But he throws in enough curveballs to keep the reader off-balance, starting with the first scene where a beautiful young lady struts into the private eye's office. Our lovers eventually make their way to no-holds-bar Las Vegas where the action grows even weirder. I'd say WILD WIVES is great fun to read on a rainy or snowy day."], ["This was a slim but satisfying noir novelette that delivers exactly what you want from a slim but satisfying noir novelette.

It's a tiny novella filled with seedy and conflicted characters and a simple yet convoluted plot. Perfect pulp material.Three seperate parts are vivid in my mind for different reasons; the first being the description and behaviour of Barbara Ann Allen is graphic and shocking in it's content like a slap to the face with a block of ice, if you weren't sure that this novel was going to be anything different than a cheap Dashiell Hammett knockoff already then by page 4 you will be 100% convinced.Willeford follows this up with some gratuitous and unnecessary violence; first you're given a hint as Jake Blake nonchalently attacks a man without prior warning and a few pages later what amounts to a hate crime with some self-loathing thrown in and some latent homosexuality undertones, is as brutal a beating as I've seen described in literature for quite some time.The final image I'll leave you with is the climax, Willeford manages to pull a rabbit out of a hat when you didn't even see the hat or the arm reaching in to it, with as true a depressing, existential and classically pulp noir ending as you've ever read.A fast and enjoyable read but not long enough to truly be called amazing."], ["Willeford takes what seemingly starts out to be a typical hard-boiled private eye story and turns it on it's head with with this fast paced and insanely plotted noir."], ["This early book by Charles Willeford has depth beyond it's deceptively simple plot. At first glance, it's just another detective story, but beneath the surface is an examination of post-war America, with a noir protagonist who has been changed by the war he fought in, and even may be suffering from PTSD beneath his always cool, sarcastic exterior. Not Willeford's best work, but definitely worth reading if you like noir with a little more depth."], ["Damn, so good. Got this for less than a buck from PlanetMonk Books.

One reviewer said 'deadpan' humor, and another said 'wry off-beat humor.' I agree with both. Charles Willeford gave writers who read him and who came after him, something use in their writing.

People always comment on how beautiful her hair is which she interprets to mean that they don\u2019t find her pretty. She cuts her hair off. She wears what is left in pigtails. She buys a man\u2019s hat that is certainly eccentric for a young girl to wear in Saigon in 1929. She wants people to notice her eyes, her lips, certainly something other than her hair. She wants reassurance that her beauty is larger than one exquisite feature. She is fifteen and a half. Her father is dead. Her mother is poor. Her older brother is a layabout, spoiled by her mother. Her other brother is nice, but no match for the rest of the family. She is lost in a world between adulthood and childhood, a dream world, and a world of harsh realities.

She was born in Saigon and did have a wealthy, much older, Chinese lover. At fifteen I think most of us believe we will love many people. We will have many exciting affairs of the heart. True love will be a field of flowers not a single stem already residing in the hand. At fifteen, even when we think we are in love, we can\u2019t know whether it is real. Our basis of comparison is too slender, too new, too wrapped in hormonal need to really know what we feel is love. \nI love this picture of Marguerite Duras. The languid, weighted eyelids are a point of fascination.She wrote this novel at the age of seventy. After fifty-five years I\u2019m sure that Duras\u2019s memories have been filtered through many lenses. The sepia tones of her time with her Chinese lover have deepened. The uncertainty is gone and she is left with clear, concise, brush strokes of a commemoration of lost love. This is a novel and from what I read there are deviations from her nonfiction accounts of her first affair, but this book reads of truth. The reader is left with a precise picture of a young woman who may have lost some of her innocence, but gains a self-confidence to break away from her meaningless life and swim for a new shore.

I heard her voice as if it were inside my head, Very early in my life it was too late. It was already too late when I was eighteen. How did you get there, my friend? Or should I call you my sister, since from the beginning I discovered we shared anguishes and most certainly a great multitude of passions and dreams? We both were introduced to this world by tortured mothers, who experienced this deep despondency about living. Sometimes it lasted, sometimes it would vanish with the dark. But their desperation was thoroughly heartfelt, for what can a daughter do when facing a mother desperate with a despair so unalloyed that sometimes even life\u2019s happiness, at its most poignant, couldn\u2019t make them forget it. We daughters recognize them effortlessly as the awkward way she holds herself, the way she doesn\u2019t smile. That image of our mothers certainly stayed with both of us for life, my friend. But what can we do, but go on living? I glance outside, and the wind is speeding like my heart is beating, faster and faster, bum, bum, bum, as I get to know you.But suddenly my mind gets back inside. Yes, I was also there when you met the nameless man while crossing the river going back to Saigon with a storm blowing inside the water. I will never forget how you looked at our first meeting, my friend, wearing a dress of real silk, the famous pair of gold lame high heels and a man\u2019s flat-brimmed hat, a brownish-pink fedora with a broad black ribbon. I have to agree with you, The crucial ambiguity of the image lies in the hat. You were only fifteen and a half, but wearing powder to camouflage the freckles and your mother\u2019s lipstick. He was elegant, not a white man but wearing European clothes. Again I remember myself, walking hand in hand with a 26-year-old man when I was just sixteen. Our experiences seem to mimic each other, don\u2019t you think? But while I had two fine sisters, you had two wild brothers that would never do anything.Going back to your nameless young man, as you told me he  got out of the limousine and is smoking an English cigarette. He looks at you in the man\u2019s fedora and the gold shoes. He slowly comes over to you. He doesn\u2019t smile to begin with. He\u2019s obviously nervous. Was it so easy to get into this man\u2019s car, dear friend? I don\u2019t know if I would have had the courage or the temerity. That\u2019s a clue that even though sisters, we are inherently different. And he presented himself, I was thin and soft and na\u00efve, even though I had just returned from two years in Paris. I was still a boy, at 28. I\u2019m sure I would have continued as a boy, unless I met you. And you simply got into his car. The door shuts. A barely discernible distress suddenly seized you, weariness, the light over the river dims, but only slightly. Everywhere, too, there\u2019s a very slight dearness, or fog.Further memories of those times we shared during one of our meetings, comes running back to me. It is as if I was there with you, peeping into your afternoons. At first he looks at you as though he expects you to speak, but you don\u2019t. He says he loves you madly, says it very softly. Then is silent. You don\u2019t answer. You could say you don\u2019t love him. You say nothing. But you did not stop at that, no, you said, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t love me. But if you do, I\u2019d like you to do as you usually do with women. He looked at you in horror, asked, Is that what you want? You said it is. He says he knows already you\u2019ll never love him. Then you let him say it. You were a cool one, weren't you? I look out the window, and now it\u2019s raining like if it was going to drown us, hiding the sun shining at me. It's dark inside, for nothing could be harder than remembering those times. We who are now almost old ladies, at least well into our mature years. On top of my supposed wisdom, I wonder what is it so mysterious about being a woman. As a matter of fact, I often asked myself that before meeting my first lover at sixteen. Yes, I was some months older than you. Not that it would have made any difference if I could envision what and where that would lead me to. As you said some women just wait, they dress just for the sake of dressing. They look at themselves, dream of romance. long days of waiting. Some of them go mad. Some are ditched. You can hear the word hit them, hear the sound of the blow. Some kill themselves. But that was never us; please tell me so. But why could we expect to be different? Did you ever think you might have known, but forgot to tell me? Suddenly inspiration hits me, and I know how we saved ourselves despite our mothers. Do you still remember what you said, some time ago? I think you might have forgotten, let me remind you: it\u2019s so simple, it was the writing that saved us! You told me how it all started,I want to write. I\u2019ve already told my mother. That\u2019s what I want to do\u2013write. No answer the first time. Then she asks, Write what? I say, Books, novels. She says grimly, when you\u2019ve got your math degree you can write if you like, it won\u2019t be anything to do with me then. She\u2019s against it, it\u2019s not worthy, it\u2019s not real work, it\u2019s nonsense. Later she said, A childish idea.I answered that what I wanted more than anything else in the world was to write, nothing else but that, nothing. Jealous. She\u2019s jealous. No answer, just a quick glance immediately averted, a slight shrug, unforgettable. I\u2019ll be the first to leave.I also write, although nobody knows, I am not famous after all. But it saved me nonetheless. But you tried to hide it from me. It\u2019s ok; I forgive you, my friend. But I remember so well what you said once, I\u2019ve never written, though I thought I wrote, never loved, though I thought I loved, never done anything but wait outside the closed door.So many years have passed us by, leaving their ignoble scars; but we still reminisce all that went when we were almost children. Yes, you told me I can still see his face, and I do remember the name. The name you forgot to tell me. Indeed, it\u2019s a place of distress, shipwrecked. And your mother, that went on living even after you left her. Let\u2019s leave your brothers and my sisters for another talk, please. Or what you told me happened in Paris. Or my years in London and New York. Let\u2019s leave the rest for another time, for I know with a certainty that goes deep into my bones, that we will meet again. Until then!__Notes1.

The characters in this story are nameless. A puzzle of personal pronouns draws an anonymous canvas that perspires with alienation and the dense humidity of a foreign land, that mourns the loss of youth and innocence, that invokes the image of photographs never taken, the sound of words never uttered and the mirage of a future that never existed.

Memories are her brushstrokes and life-consuming longing the color in which she paints her pictorial story. The awakening of first love and the discovery of erotic pleasure arrive hand in hand with the heartbreak of a certain separation, the sentence to life imprisonment by familial duty and the ruthlessness of intransigent tradition. The cultural distance between the local people and the colonizers in French Indochina become the backdrop of a love story that is condemned by history before it even started and the detached irony that drips from the narrator\u2019s voice can\u2019t disguise the desolation that is eating her alive underneath a carefully studied, impassive poise.\u201cThe Lover\u201d is a cascade of musical notes delivered in fluid movements, a whirlwind of words repeated like a mantra in breathless cadence and staccatto punctuation . \u201cThe Lover\u201d is more than a semi autobiographical memoir and less than an interior monologue.

L. James, Marguerite Duras has written a sparse, minimal and painfully sad erotic love story that never gets drawn into the realms of romantic fantasy.And to deeply appreciate 'The Lover', it needs to be looked at from the perspective of Duras herself. Pen was put to paper when she was 70, it's predominantly all about looking back on memories past, and I say it's a painful read, painful in respects to nostalgia, as nostalgia forms the basis for the story that has origins from her actual youth while living in French Indochina, age fifteen she fell in love with a rich Chinese man. Duras takes this premise and places a white teenage girl in South Vietnam, into the arms of a wealthy older man who catches her eye while been driven in a limousine. But this is a forbidden love that was always doomed, trying to keep secret from her mother and two brothers she would regularly meet with her lover for moments of passionate bliss.Duras stays away from any attention seeking sexual content, and never covers ground of what's right or wrong, just tells the simple tale of innocence lost. The narrative at times appears broken, and there is little in the way of dialogue, but his only helps to fortify the reading experience of it feeling like a distant dream.After being Oscar nominated for her screenplay on the Alain Resnais film classic 'Hiroshima mon amour', Duras would rightly win Frances most prestigious literary prize, the Prix Goncourt, and she will always remains a significant French writer."], ["DesireThe first time ever I saw your face was on the ferry.I had my head buried in a copy of the South China Morning Post. My father had said, if I read it every day, I would learn about the world around us, and his boy would become a man. Only then would I be ready to take over the family business after him.He was right, in his way. I was thin and soft and na\u00efve, even though I had just returned from two years in Paris. I was still a boy, at 28. I\u2019m sure I would have continued as a boy, unless I had met you.I had slept with many girls in Paris, and I bedded plenty more after you, before I married my wife, a virgin until our wedding night. But I didn't sleep with any of these girls out of love or even desire. I fucked them because I could. They came to me eager to be fucked, and we all knew the reason, my family\u2019s wealth and increasing prominence in Saigon. They all came to me, because they wanted something that my father had.My father was not an egotistical man. He did not display pride or shame. He did everything out of duty, even make money, buy property, run a department store and build wealth. But when it came to the girls I slept with (not you), and he always found out about them, he took some delight in my sexual activity. No matter how attractive each one was, he knew that by sleeping with them, I was actually disqualifying them from the race to be my wife and share his wealth. Everyone I slept with narrowed it down to the one I would eventually marry.I looked up from the Post, some article on inflation, and I saw you taking a seat opposite me. I gazed at you longer than I should have.Everything about you was wrong. You were Caucasian, white, 15 \u00bd years old, slim, you were wearing a flowing dress that alternately swayed in the breeze or clung to your body, outlining and highlighting your petite breasts. And you were wearing a man\u2019s fedora and gold shoes.Once I took all of this in, I tried to resume reading the Post. I was looking down at the page, but I couldn\u2019t distinguish a single word, I was thinking of you and I was shaking. Like a boy.Later the same week, we happened to be on the same ferry again. I didn\u2019t see you on board, but when my father\u2019s driver (until recently, when he retired, my driver) opened the door to the limousine, I noticed that you were standing near the waterline, apparently deciding what you would do next.I went up to you, determined to offer you a ride in my car, I mean my father\u2019s car. You were apprehensive at first, but I reassured you of my good faith, and you decided to accept. It helped that I was shaking the whole way through our brief discussion.While we were talking, we stood side on, so that my driver could see both of us, the sides of our faces and the hints of nervous smiles. Something must have touched him, unless he did it out of a sense of duty to my father, for he took a photo of us that day.He gave it to me when he retired 10 years ago. I have carried it with me, in my wallet, every day since then. Until today, I haven\u2019t pulled it out and looked at it again. I didn\u2019t need to. That moment, in my eyes, has been engraved in my mind for fifty years. The only difference is that the image confirms that I was there, that it wasn\u2019t all in my imagination, you can see both of us. The image is true, and so now is my memory. Only I\u2019m not sure whether I ever wanted to be reminded. It\u2019s not that the photo reminds me of a time when I was a boy. After all, it was you who made me a man, not reading the Post.Like my father before me, I am a man of duty. I have faithfully taken care of my wife, my family, my family\u2019s business. Everything has grown under my watchful and caring eye. I have done the right thing, and I will die a contented man, if contentment is what I am looking for.No, what that photo and that moment remind me of is my capacity for desire. It is something I eliminated from my field of vision after we parted company, at my parents\u2019 insistence, and you returned to Paris, I thought, with your mother.I already knew the rudimentary mechanics of sex when we stood before each other, a skinny Chinese boy and a skinny French girl, in my bedroom for the first time. As I had done before, I was shaking. Even my tentative erection looked as if it might shake off and fall to the floor. It\u2019s funny now, but it wasn\u2019t funny then.Until I met you, I had been lonely. I was even lonelier after I had met you, because of the obsessive love I had for you.You said, \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t love me, but if you do, I\u2019d like you to do as you usually do with women.\u201dI asked, \u201cIs that what you want?\u201dYou nodded. Still I knew that you would never love me, that you could never love me.I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve come here with me as you might have gone anywhere with anyone.\u201dYou replied, \u201cI can\u2019t say, so far I\u2019ve never gone into a bedroom with anyone.\u201dYou begged me, again, to do what I usually did with the women I brought to my room.I did my best to comply. Although you were a virgin, I made love to you the way you directed me to. It was different to how I normally did it, well there was one difference, I wept while we made love.The driver soon learned about you, and so did my father. He could tell I felt differently about you, that I wasn\u2019t disqualifying you, that I wanted to marry this white girl, even though you would never love me in return.He made his position very clear.\u201cI will not let my son marry this little white whore from Sadec.\u201dI tried to obliterate his attitude from my thinking. But it must have affected me subliminally. In bed, as we fucked more and more passionately, I would call out, \u201cMy whore, my slut, you are my only love.\u201d And you and I and my cum and your juices and our sweat would be swept up in a torrent of desire.For a long time, it seemed as if that torrent would never stop. I didn\u2019t know where the waters sprang from, but I definitely didn\u2019t know where they were heading.My father did, and so he built a dam that would contain the flow, and one day the torrent just stopped.Loving you had made me a man, he knew that, as I did, and although we disagreed wildly, I was reconciled to my future in the family business.As my father loosened his grip on the reins and handed them over to me, I expanded to two and then eventually five department stores, and then years later with such a solid foundation, I started investing in shopping centres in Australia, until my family became the largest private holder of retail real estate in the country.Like my father, I am not an egotistical man or a proud one. I do this because of duty. But there was a moment when I contented myself with a smile. I had just signed a contract to purchase a centre in Australia for A$30 million. I signed a cheque for a A$3M deposit and gave it to the Vendor\u2019s lawyer. A youngish fellow, he decided to phone my banker and ask whether I had sufficient funds in my account to clear the cheque. The banker asked what the total sale price was. The lawyer answered, and my banker laughed. \u201cThere are enough funds in this account to pay the entire sale price in cash.\u201dThe lawyer turned to me, squeamishly, and declared that we had a deal. I said, \u201cI was under the impression we had a deal before you phoned my bank.\u201dI enquired after that lawyer once. It turned out he had married one of my property managers and was now running a coffee shop, ironically in one of my centres.I have two daughters. They run our portfolio, and they do a more professional job of it than either I or my father ever did.Perhaps, my father was better at taking risks than they are, but to be honest they are pretty good at it. I am proud of them, and he would be too. They have married well, and have given me four beautiful grandchildren.As I said, I have carried our photo in my wallet for many years, ever since I learned of its existence.Any other man in my position would possibly say that they had everything that they had ever desired.For me, that is true, except in one sense that I have tried to overlook for fifty years.I once desired you, that skinny white French girl in the fedora. I desired you with an intensity that I cannot find words to describe.I have tried to rationalise and deny that desire. I\u2019ve tried to convince myself that I only ever desired you once. And that is actually the truth. I did only desire you once, but that one occasion has lasted fifty years.Now that I am about to die, or think I am, and my family will soon gather around me to say their farewells, I must take a match to this photo and set it alight, like you once set me alight, and perhaps, I will never know, perhaps I also set you alight, if not for as long.My favourite nurse just brought me an ashtray and a cigarette lighter. It took me two or three attempts to burn this image. It didn\u2019t seem to want to go.But now it is finished and there are only ashes in the tray, and my failing memory, and when I die and it too goes, there will be nothing left of our desire.\nMural at the Pawpaw Cafe attached to the Brisbane Restaurant \"Green Papaya\""], ["Prix Goncourt : 1984 .

Is it pleasure or pain? Can and should we try to control it? To trust it? To understand it? Do we shape our desires or do they shape us? What part of us is desire? Is it the purest and deepest aspect of human nature? Where does it come from? Can a desire on its own be vile or virtuous or only actions are bound to be judged? How much do we know about our desires and where do they lead us? What brings two people together? What brings together a French girl and Chinese man twelve years older than her? Set in the 1930s in Indochina, this is a tale about two people trying to break their bonds, but unable to do so. They are kindred spirits in more ways than one. They are both oppressed by their families, they are both unable to understand their feelings. They lose themselves in passion that is born from more than romance. It is a passion for change, for freedom. But can there be truly freedom in desire? Is desire bound to enslave us or free us? Buddhists believe that desire is the reason for all human suffering and only liberation of desire may lead to ultimate happiness. But along with pain can we also find pleasure in unfulfilled desires? Is all longing pain and dissatisfaction? Can it be an inspiration, a fuel? Don\u2019t those of us focusing only on present pleasures close the doors for achieving greater ones? Should we give up the possibility for more in order to fully enjoy what we have now or should we sacrifice some of that bliss for the hope of a bigger one? Longing brings pain and emptiness with itself, but it also makes the good part even better. Which is better? An ordinary, calm, perfect happiness or happiness stained by the pain which comes with longing, but also enriched by the intensity and passion that come along with it? The former sounds better if we accept that happiness is just a lack of pain. But Is it just that? In \u201cNotes from the Underground\u201d it is explored the idea of finding pleasure in pain. People don\u2019t just desire what they cannot have. They also desire what ultimately can never bring them happiness. Often the greatest joys and sorrows are consequences of each other. This is a story of doomed lovers, who love each other with all the intensity and passion of people who know they are about to lose each other. \"He didn\u2019t speak of the pain, never said a word about it. Sometimes his face would quiver, he\u2019d close his eyes and clench his teeth. But he never said anything about the images he saw behind his closed eyes. It was as if he loved the pain, loved it as he\u2019d loved me, intensely, unto death perhaps, and as if he preferred it now to me.\".  Do we treasure the most that which we are bound to lose? Do we sometimes risk to lose it in order to feel it more intensely? If we always want more, does that make us adventurers, masochists, seekers of wisdom\u2026or maybe just people? Desire can built us or ruin us. Sometimes is does both. If desire is pleasure and pain equally, how do we cope? How do the protagonists do it? She admits her feelings only in the end, when she has already lost him. Maybe because she was afraid that loving him would make the loss all the more painful? But it would have made the anterior pleasure all the greater and wouldn\u2019t those precious moments, her getting everything she can out of them, eventually be a consolation as well? Maybe this is why he loves pain. It is pain born out of feeling which he savours at its wholesome. Do we dare to be adventurous and desire or are we determined to treasure that which we already have? Dreams of the future can both enrich and rob us of our present. It is all about balance. We should always look with hope for the future and dream, but not in a way that makes us forget the value of that which we have now. We should always remember the value of what we already have, but we should also always remember to dream. Hadn\u2019t great artists and adventurers dreamed and desired, we wouldn\u2019t have had everything we have today. Worlds are built on dreams and desires.Read count: 1"], ["Dearest Marguerite,I know it is awfully late now, to write to you. I could not resist though. I thought about you the other day; as her eyes scanned the Chinese gentleman for the first time, on the ferry to Mekong. The demure young features veiled under a mannish hat, gave away precocious impression of a 15 year old girl as he offered her a cigarette. The statuesque Chinaman who exuded charm and eloquence was besotted by her as she was by him. He was to be her lover; an escape from the abhorrent and impoverished life. On the brink of her sexual exploration, she yearned for the pleasure of his touch, his embrace; a world that was beyond the imagination of a young school girl. As she pressed her red-stained lips on the cold glass of his car, he knew he could never marry her, a fact that he told her several times, but would always love her, for \u201cA love like this, so strong, it never happens again in a lifetime\u2026never.\u201dAs the movie played on my screen, I searched for your book and there it lay among the dusty pile of old books, a slight tattered at the cover page. An affair of a pubescent girl with a 27-year old affluent Chinese man brings variation in one\u2019s perception. Over the years, the book was disparaged for its pedophilic nature and the overtly sexual display of a young girl romanticizing to the term 'prostitutes'. The girl\u2019s impecunious and abusive family history, they said was a convenient backdrop to pen a fragile child pornographic literary piece. From the time I read the book as an 12 year old, when I accidentally \u201cborrowed\u201d the book from my cousin\u2019s library stock to those several occasions, I comprehended the writings as an adult, all I observed was a power struggle of an adolescent who naively used her sexuality to find a sense of belonging and in some way gain control over her existence. The story is far more complicated than just the exterior of a love affair. It delineates a distorted notion of true love (if the term is applicable here), the hypocrisy of social mores and the chaos derived from infidelity and wealth.I have cherished the book for decades now, and words fail me in expressing my heartwarming thankfulness for bursting my initial deluded bubble of an idyllic Nancy Drew utopia, exposing the discrepancies of a flawed society and sullied emotions. Life unexpectedly became a rational place to live in.R.I. P. \u2013 Ms. Duras.From, The 7th grader, who once scribbled \u2018orgasm\u2019 for the very first time in her history textbook and became wiser."], ["Something dark and deeply unsettling simmers angrily beneath the surface of this narrative. This 'something' becomes so potent a force, arousing fear and feelings of disgust in the reader, that one is often tempted to abandon reading and save oneself from all the unpleasantness Duras shoves right in the reader's face without inhibitions.'The Lover' is a brutally honest attempt at reconciliation with the past, irrespective of how much hurt and damage it may have caused. It is a tale of Marguerite Duras' childhood years spent in what is modern day Vietnam and reads almost like a memoir or piece of non-fiction at times. The narrator of The Lover is sometimes a young girl of 15, sometimes a woman, sometimes a mere child, sometimes an old lady living in France as an established novelist and sometimes a girl caught in a painful identity crisis. Duras' erratic narration and tendency to flip back and forth between the past and present and her personal contemplations (slightly in a Slaughterhouse-Fiveish way) ensure that the reader occasionally loses the thread connecting all the events. But even so the story resonates strongly with the one reading and and one can barely prevent a disturbing image of human suffering from being burned into their mind.The unnamed narrator's voice is strangely full of apathy and indifference. It almost lacks a clear character. There are times when the resentment in this young girl reaches a fever pitch and thrashes about restlessly for an outlet into the realm of reality. But in the very next moment, it reduces in intensity and assumes its former state of equanimity. It is as if she is torn between feelings of revulsion and longing and cannot pick one over the other. Her existence itself seems precariously balanced on the predominant emotions of hatred and love that she feels for the people closest to her. She begins a turbulent love affair with a much older, rich Chinese man and this, in turn, becomes both a boon and a bane for her. He becomes her safe haven from the cruelties of life and the emotional and physical abuse she silently suffers at the hands of her own family members. But then, he also becomes the cause of her social stigma and shame - thus he is her tormentor and her savior at the same time.\nI see the war as like him, spreading everywhere, breaking in everywhere, stealing, imprisoning, always there, merged and mingled with everything, present in the body, in the mind, awake and asleep, all the time, a prey to the intoxicating passion of occupying that delightful territory, a child's body, the bodies of those less strong, of conquered peoples. Because evil is there, at the gates, against the skin.\nInitially it is hinted that the young girl is cold and indifferent towards her lover and possibly does not reciprocate his feelings. But at the end of the affair, she comes to the realization that her love for him may have been genuine after all.A perpetual state of chaos seems to prevail inside the adolescent protagonist's head and this almost becomes an accurate reflection of the tumultuous times of a colonized, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic Indo-China (present Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) - a war-ravaged land whose fortunes remained at the mercy of various colonial masters for decades. Even though a doomed romance forms the main subject matter of this book, what often overshadows its acutely depressing tones, is the looming presence of Indo-China. Duras' love for this land shines through the haze of her traumatic years. Because interspersed between the disturbing imagery, there are beautiful descriptions of Cholon, the Chinese capital of French Indo-China, bustling with life and activity, the river Mekong and the morning ferry carrying its passengers across to Saigon, where the young girl goes to boarding school.Thus it is heartening to see that Vietnam is not reduced to the status of a mere backdrop in a tale of personal miseries but comes alive in its state of silent agony, in Duras' sparse but beautiful prose. Its sights and sounds and smells and landscapes become an integral part of this semi autobiographical novella and add a distinct character to it.\n\"The bed is separated from the city by those slatted shutters, that cotton blind. There's nothing solid separating us from other people. They don't know of our existence. We glimpse something of theirs, the sum of their voices, of their movements, like the intermittent hoot of a siren, mournful, dim.Whiffs of burnt sugar drift into the room, smell of roasted peanuts, Chinese soups, roast meat, herbs, jasmine, dust, incense, charcoal fires, they carry fire about in baskets here, it's sold in the street, the smell of the city is the smell of the villages upcountry, of the forest.\"\nThe Lover does not make my list of all-time-favorites and nor may it merit a re-reading. But even then it rightly deserves the 4 stars I awarded it, simply because it succeeds in painting a moving picture of ambivalent relationships, that transcends the boundaries of race or ethnicity and appeals to the universal human spirit."]], "review_count": "1235", "description": "Set in the prewar Indochina of Marguerite Duras\u2019s childhood, this is the haunting tale of a tumultuous affair between an adolescent French girl and her Chinese lover.

Dark forces are gathering across Europe, about to tear the continent apart in an unprecedented act of barbarity. Henry Miller travels to Greece, ostensibly to visit a Greek writer but really to reacquaint himself with the humanistic spirit he sees flowing from there--a life-affirming spirit that's the opposite of the impending death everywhere else. Part travelogue, part diatribe, this is a book that's not going to be for everyone. I can certainly understand why some readers will have no patience for passages such as: \"It is not enough to overthrow governments, masters, tyrants: one must overthrow his own preconceived ideas of right and wrong, good and bad, just and unjust. We must abandon the hard-fought trenches we have dug ourselves into and come out into the open, surrender our arms, our possessions, our rights as individuals, classes, nations, peoples.\" It's bombastic, to be sure, but it's also a reaction to events, a pained cry of: why can't we just act differently? It's an attempt to imagine a different, better world, and I was sympathetic to it, just as I was sympathetic to Miller's imagining of the Greek spirit he wanted to capture, a spirit that was as much a creature of his own mind as anything else."], ["This beautiful and nearly flawless travel memoir is marred by this unfortunate sentence on page 121: \"On the way to the library, I made kaka in my pants.\" Wha? Here's this fabulous surreal narrative about Greece, and suddenly the narrator doesn't just shit himself, he \"makes kaka?\" Skip page 121."], ["When he was not tackling sex and philosophy, Henry Miller traveled. The Colossus of Maroussi is a book of those later times, when he, an \"American Savage\", entered the world of peace, beauty, and most of all, simplicity he was longing for while living in America. Nothing could prepare him for what he encountered in Greece, neither the streets of New York, nor the streets of Paris - as both paled in comparison. Although enamored with France, Miller's passion for Europe goes way farther in this book, which at times reads more like L. D. novel than Miller's own. Yet, at the same time, he manages to wrap himself in the beauty he encounters, dive into it without holding a breath and resurface a new, more complete being, spellbound by his experience. If only there were more writers like him - ahh, wishful thinking. Most of all, this book shows Miller in a different light, not limited by his fame for writing about sex (actually, most of his books are not) as he explores a new land, unknown to him until then. His ability to take the reader's hand and walk around the countryside, observe the people, customs, and scenery is combined with philosophy and his personal views (What else would you expect from Miller?). I have shared this book with many people who did not like Miller and their minds were changed forever. What more can be said? Nothing - read the book and find out for yourself."], ["Some critics call \"The Colossus of Maroussi\"--Henry Miller`s account of his trip to Greece on the eve of World War II--the greatest travel book ever. But, like all great travel books, it's much more than mere depiction of beautiful landscapes, missed connections, bad weather, and surly waiters--though Miller recounts those as well. Rather, the book stands as a compelling paean to the Greek spirit, to liberty, and to life--as well as a barbaric yawp prefiguring the coming cataclysm.The Canadian critic Northrop Frye once said that the \"story of the loss and regaining of identity...is the framework of all literature.\" That certainly applies well to travel literature, where the journey often occurs within the narrator as well as over the Earth, and in particular to The Colossus of Maroussi. At its core lies Miller's spiritual transformation through welcomed encounters with warm-hearted, generous, high-spirited Greeks, particularly the \"colossus\" Katsimbalis.\"I love these men, each and every one,\" writes Miller, \"for having revealed to me the true proportions of the human being...the goodness, the integrity, the charity which they emanated. They brought me face to face with myself, they cleansed me of hatred and jealousy and envy.\"Like most of Miller's writing, from the joyous novel \"Tropic of Cancer\" to his trenchant essays, this book succeeds thanks to his freewheeling iconoclasm, his divine madness, and his inimitable language:\"...Out of the corner of my eye I caught the full devastating beauty of the great plain of Thebes which we were approaching and, unable to control myself, I burst into tears. Why had no one prepared me for this? I cried out...We were amidst the low mounds and hummocks which had been stunned motionless by the swift messengers of light. We were in the dead center of that soft silence which absorbs even the breathing of gods...Through the thick pores of the earth the dreams of men long dead still bubbled and burst, their diaphanous filament carried skyward by flocks of startled birds.\"Here, as always, we see Miller as primitive shaman, awed and humbled by nature and humanity, disdainful of modernity and materialism: \"Mechanical devices have nothing to do with man's real nature--they are merely traps which Death has baited for him.\"He underscores this view of us, as animals caught in a steel maze of our own making, by his frequent metaphoric mixing of nature's fecundity and manmade tawdriness, as when he describes the approach to Delphi:\"This is an invisible corridor of time, a vast, breathless parenthesis which swells like the uterus and having bowelled forth its anguish relapses like a run-down clock.\"No, this is not your grandmother's travel writing, with its propriety, politeness, and \"realistic\" depictions, but word-pictures of an emotional landscape. That's the essence Miller strives to show: his subjective, experiential, inner reality. The subject here is Henry Miller, and what matters most is how these objects--the world--affect him.As a result, this 1941 literary bombshell, ostensibly about Greece, documents Miller's memories of New York inspired by a view of Athens, provides a lengthy disquisition on jazz when he's confronted by a French woman who disdains the chaos of Greece, and paints a disquieting, mad, and ominous picture of Saturn when he climbs to an observatory and views it through a telescope. He tells us his dreams and daydreams and what he wished he would have said. Everything is fair game; the seeming digressions frequent and fabulous.This is still nonfiction, but Miller's imaginative life at the time of his travels is real, and thus an important part of his narrative. In the end it all hangs together like a sumptuous tapestry woven by an inspired madman--which perhaps it is. We come away understanding more about the taste of Greek water, the quality of Greek light, and the magnificence of the Greek spirit than from reading all the objective reporting on Greece in the Library of Congress. He captures it all as it arrests him.Traveling at times with Katsimbalis, the poet Seferiades, and/or Lawrence Durrell, Miller moves from Athens and Corfu to Knossus and Delphi as if in search of dead Greek gods--and finds them reincarnate.We are lucky enough to travel with him, enduring treacherous seas, precipitous mountain passes, and heroic debauches, as well as feasting on the simple food, viewing the sublime beauty, and feeling the brotherhood and humanity that come to Miller like beneficent Peloponnesian sun wherever he turns. It is a trip I will make over and over again."], ["Henry Miller's reputation as a writer needs little verification from the likes of me. Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to be able to confirm the abilities of a truly great author. This example of his work is in some ways a peculiar one since it was written during a turning point in modern history, namely the Second World War, and was inevitably a turning point in Miller's own life as well.Henry Miller has not always had kind things to say about his native U. S. A. Here, in \"The Colossus of Maroussi,\" he uses the American state as a kind of false backdrop for his discoveries in Greece. For Greece is the central geographical landscape on which he builds. Far from being a travelogue, however, it is a story of that ancient land and some of its people; Miller uses the fabric of Greek life to weave a story of mankind.His writing is distinctly dated today, but delightfully so. It is full of a poetic imagery that is almost entirely absent from the main stream of post-modern literature. As such, it is very complex writing which occasionally seems to be almost self-serving, as if the author was writing for no one but himself. In the main, it is a very accessible book that tries to reach out in pure, non-political terms to touch the essential core of what is man. At the present time, we could do well to review our own situation in life, and one way of doing so is by simply reviewing the literature on the subject. I recommend \"The Colossus of Maroussi\" as a place to start. Besides being the work of a truly formidable writer, it will take you to places you probably never dreamed existed."], ["On the Road in Greece. Okay, that\u2019s probably an exaggeration, but the sentiment is, I think, accurate. As does Kerouac in On the Road, Miller displays the same quickening to judgment, the same contempt for the bourgeois, the same obsession for the real. Greece to him is real. Unfortunately, the Greece that he sees is anything but. Miller falls in love with a vision of Greece that is as much made of present Greek poverty and past Greek myth. Part lengthy diatribe against modern civilization, part poetic paean of the Greek landscape, The Colossus of Maroussi is more a voyage into Miller than it is into Greece."], ["...the last parts of the mosaic:\"We say erroneously that the Greeks humanized the gods. It is just the contrary. The gods humanized the Greeks. There was a Moment when it seemed as if the real significance of life had been grasped, a breathless Moment when the destiny of the whole human race was in jeopardy. The Moment was lost in the blaze of power which engulfed the intoxicated Greeks. They made mythology of a reality which was too great for their human comprehension. We Forget, in our enchantment with the myth, that it is Born of reality and is fundamentally no different from any other form of creation, except that it has to do with the very quick of life. We too are creating myths, though we are perhaps not Aware of it. But in our myths there is no place for the gods. We are Building an Abstract, dehumanized world out of the ashes of an illusory materialism. We are proving to ourselves that the universe is empty, a Task which is justified by our own empty logic.

The book-learning gradually dribbles away; problems melt and dissolve ties are gently severed; thinking, when you deign to indulge in it, becomes very primitive; the body becomes a new and wonderful instrument; you look at plants or stones or fish with different eyes; you wonder what people are struggling to accomplish by their frenzied activities; you know there is a war on but you haven't the faintest idea what it's about or why people should enjoy killing one another; you look at a place like Albania\u2014it was constantly staring me in the eyes\u2014and you say to yourself, yesterday it was Greek, today it's Italian, tomorrow it may be German or Japanese, and you let it be anything it chooses to be. When you're right with yourself it doesn't matter what flag is flying over your head or who owns what or whether you speak English or Monongahela. The absence of newspapers, the absence of news about what men are doing in different parts of the world to make life more livable or unlivable is the greatest single boon. If we could just eliminate newspapers a great advance would be made, I am sure of it. Newspapers engender lies, hatred, greed, envy, suspicion, fear, malice. We don't need the truth as it is dished up to us in the daily papers. We need peace and solitude and idleness. If we could all go on strike and honestly disavow all interest in what our neighbor is doing we might get a new lease of life. We might learn to do without telephones and radios and newspapers, without machines of any kind, without factories, without mills, without mines, without explosives, without battleships, without politicians, without lawyers, without canned goods, without gadgets, without razor blades -even or cellophane or cigarettes or money. This is a pipe dream, I know. People only go on strike for better working conditions, better wages, better opportunities to become something other than they are.\u201c\u201cBut there is something colossal about any human figure when that individual becomes truly and thoroughly human. A more human individual than Katsimbalis I have never met. Walking with him through the streets of Amaroussion I had the feeling that I was walking the earth in a totally new way. The earth became more intimate, more alive, more promising. He spoke frequently of the past, it is true, not as something dead and forgotten however, but rather as something which we carry within us, something which fructifies the present and makes the future inviting. He spoke of little things and of great with equal reverence; he was never too busy to pause and dwell on the things which moved him; he had endless time on his hands, which in itself is the mark of a great soul. How can I ever forget that last impression he made upon me when we said farewell at the bus station in the heart of Athens? There are men who are so full, so rich, who give themselves so completely that each time you take leave of them you feel that it is absolutely of no consequence whether the parting is for a day, or forever. They come to you brimming over and they fill you to overflowing. They ask nothing of you except that you participate in their superabundant joy of living. They never inquire which side of fence you are on because the world they inhabit has no fences. They make themselves invulnerable by habitually exposing themselves to every danger. They grow more heroic in the measure that they reveal their weaknesses. Certainly in those endless and seemingly fabulous stories which Katsimbalis was in the habit of recounting there must have been a good element of fancy and distortion, yet even if truth was occasionally sacrificed to reality the man behind the story only succeeded thereby in revealing more faithfully and thoroughly his human image.\u201d"]], "review_count": "184", "description": "The Colossus of Maroussi is an impressionist travelogue by Henry Miller, written in 1939 and first published in 1941 by Colt Press of San Francisco. As an impoverished writer in need of rejuvenation, Miller travelled to Greece at the invitation of his friend, the writer Lawrence Durrell. The text is inspired by the events that occurred. The text is ostensibly a portrait of the Greek writer George Katsimbalis, although some critics have opined that is more of a self-portrait of Miller himself.[1] Miller considered it to be his greatest work.", "author": "Henry Miller"}, "Craniosacral Therapy II: Beyond the Dura": {"average_rating": "4.25", "review": [["Published some forty years after it was written during the liberation of Paris, Marguerite Duras, with a state of mind that is clearly under the influence of paranoia, anguish, and deep worry, writes of her day to day experiences in 1944, during uncertain times in the French capital. Duras apparently found this written account as a diary in a couple of exercise books inside a cupboard, and says,\"I have no recollection of having written it. I know I did. I recognize my own handwriting, details of the story, I can see the place, and various comings and goings. But I can't see myself writing the diary. When would I have done so?, in what year?, at what times of the day?, in what house?I can't remember.\"Asked by a magazine many years later for a text she had penned during her younger days, she confronts herself with a tremendous chaos of thought and feeling to describe 'The War' as a one of the most important things in her life. Duras writes here (like some of her fictional work) using a spare, and almost arid prose, she keeps sentences brief, sometimes only two or three words long. She is continually self-involved, examining emotions and intellectual reactions to emotional states until it feels almost suffocating. It's painful, at least in the first third, which shes her husband (Robert. L) returning from Belsen a mere skeleton, more dead than alive. In fact death and dying is something Duras can't escape from, tormented, believing he will never come back, she thinks of her own death, constantly, in a state of acceptance. The original French title 'La douleur' (Suffering) would have been a far more appropriate title at this point. Nursing her love back from the brink is horrendous in detail, he can't eat properly as the shock to his body could kill him, but needs food and water as to survive, he passes a nauseating liquid waste, that has the foul, God awful stench of decomposition. But Slowly, very slowly, his condition would improve, as the lingering smell of death seems to leave his body. For Marguerite though, the love she once had for her husband, has been ravaged by the war.The rest of the memoir looks at Duras's involvement with the French Resistance network, the brutal Interrogation of a suspected collaborator, and her run in a with the Jew hunter 'Rabier', a sly Gestapo officer who takes a liking to her, but only for his plans of gaining information on colleagues. She plays into his hands, probably for survival, and a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse endures on the streets of Paris. The book is completed with two very short fictional works whilst Duras served in the French Communist Party. 'The Crushed Nettle' is followed by 'Aurelia Paris' (which she was tempted to transpose to the stage) about a young girl hiding out in a tower with an old woman, gun in hand, simply waiting for the German police to knock on the door.Honest, harrowing, and intense, this may not be her best work, but it is no doubt the most truthful and hard-hitting. As a fan of World War Two non-fiction I have read better, but as a Duras purest this was simply a must. For anyone that appreciates her writing it's worth a look, or for that matter an interest in life during WW2. An excellent account of a woman living through hell, but it still lacked some depth with being only 180 pages long."], ["La Douleur = The War, Marguerite Duras La Douleur (War: A Memoir) is a controversial, semi-autobiographical work by Marguerite Duras published in 1985 but drawn from diaries that she supposedly wrote during World War II. It is a collection of six texts recounting a mix of her experiences of the Nazi Occupation of France, with fictional details. She claims to have \"forgotten\" ever writing the diary in which she recorded her wartime experiences, but most critics believe that to be a deliberate attempt to confuse autobiography and fiction. Duras' work is often cited as part of the Nouveau Roman movement which tried to redefine traditional ideas about set categories of books, fiction, non-fiction, biography, autobiography,

Its apologists in the Bush-Cheney administration were eloquent about why it can sometimes be necessary. We were frequently told about ticking time-bombs and the threat of a mushroom cloud over an American city. Some horrifying stories surfaced from people who had been tortured at Guant\u00e1namo, Abu Ghraib, and elsewhere. But, and it just occurs to me now to think how odd this is, I don't recall reading one straightforward account told from the torturer's point of view. If you're curious, you can read one here. Marguerite Duras was a member of the Resistance in wartime France. In Albert des Capitales, one of the pieces in this book, she describes in her usual matter-of-fact way an incident that occurred a few days after the Liberation. She and the other members of her cell are hanging around when a waiter comes running in and says that there's a guy at his bistro who's an informer. Everyone in his home town knows he is. But they'll have to move fast and grab him before he disappears.So they rush into the caf\u00e9 and arrest him. He's an overweight, unhealthy-looking guy in his 50s. He looks kind of dirty and unwashed. They make him empty his pockets. There's a notebook with names and addresses, and every so often the notation ALBERT DES CAPITALES. They want to know what this means. The guy thinks, or pretends to think, and then he says, oh yes, he's a waiter at another caf\u00e9, Les Capitales. He has a drink there sometimes on the way home. Okay, says the leader of the Resistance cell, this must be his contact. We need to start rolling up the network. He immediately sends three people over to arrest Albert, but they come back empty-handed. He left days ago. They figure they'll interrogate the informer anyway. He must be able to tell them something else, and if they wait the trail will go cold. The leader asks Marguerite if she wants to lead the interrogation. Why not, she says.They take the informer into a back room and order him to strip. He takes his clothes off slowly, hanging them up on the back of a chair so they won't get creased. One of the guys tells him to hurry up, they haven't got all day. He apologises and carries on removing his clothes. His underpants and socks are dirty. When he's naked, Marguerite asks him how to find Albert des Capitales. He answers evasively and the guys start hitting him a bit. Then Margurite asks him what he did when he visited the Gestapo headquarters. Nothing special, he says, moaning a bit and rubbing the places where they've hit him. I left my ID card at the door and went up. It was just some black market crap, nothing important.So what color was your card? asks Marguerite, but he won't answer. They hit him, and then they hit him more, and he's bleeding in several places. She asks him again what color his card was, and he still won't answer, so they carry on hitting and kicking him. Several other people have come in to watch. A couple of women say uncertainly that maybe this is enough. The leader says that anyone who thinks it's disgusting is welcome to leave. No one leaves.The informer's screaming and covered in blood as they kick him around like a ball. But he still won't say what color his card was. Marguerite tells him he'd better answer or they'll kill him. It looks like she means it. She tries different possibilities. Was it white? He moans no. Red? Also no. Yellow? No again.In the end, he screams out that it was green. That's the color that means he's an S.D. secret agent. Marguerite tells the guys to stop torturing him and let him put his clothes on. She goes out and sees a woman who'd missed all the fun.He confessed, says Marguerite. So fucking what? shrugs the woman. Marguerite starts crying. We should just let him go, she says. People won't like that, says the cell leader.She didn't get around to publishing this story until 1985. _______________________________________The \"green card\" plays an important role in Simenon's La Neige Etait Sale. It becomes clear that anyone who had a green card was a tool of the Nazi occupiers, and could legitimately be regarded as the worst kind of collaborator and traitor."], ["Reviewed in conjunction with Roughneck by Jim ThompsonSometimes you read a book that makes you feel ashamed of your life, every time you thought you were unlucky or that you deserve more or that you should get more. Whatever you have suffered, however genuine it be, suddenly becomes as nothing, its place clearly fixed in the universe as the measliest dot the world ever has seen. Roughneck does that. It describes a portion of his life in the pared down, straightforward way Thompson tells all his stories. Nothing is oversized, filled with extra words so that you can feel like you are getting more than you paid for. You are, of course. But not in word count. As is so often the case, the small story about a few, packs so much more punch than big numbers. This one starts before the Great Depression and takes us through that period. Not that I should be calling it a story. I groaned when I realised I\u2019d picked up an autobiography, not a novel. Live life, don\u2019t read about others, p-llllease. But I was too mean not to read it, serves me right for not looking carefully when I bought it. And before two pages were up I was goggle-eyed, gaping-mouthed hooked.The man\u2019s a genius. He can even make biography bearable. I\u2019m not going to review this, for the simple reason that I\u2019m not worthy too. The human suffering he writes about, what Americans did to Americans, even white Americans to white Americans, would be demeaned by anything I said about it. I don\u2019t think I ever realised so clearly the extent to which poverty and wealth create the same barriers, the same hate as race or religion, maybe even worse. Watching the way wealthy Americans treated those they were exploiting in this period made my stomach churn. I think that\u2019s the most incredible aspect of it. It is so easy to understand poor people might hate rich. But this book brings home the other side of this and it is truly ghastly to watch.This is a wildy entertaining book, but it is about people who were rich, watching, exploiting and being despicable to their poor neighbours. It is about people unnecessarily half starving, living in the most desperate circumstances and heart in mouth hoping they pull through. It makes you ashamed to be human.So I thought.But then, I hadn\u2019t picked up La Douleur yet.\u2018Shit.\u2019 That is what I did say out loud, irritated when I picked this up, the very next book after Roughneck. Another hasty purchase, another %$^#$ autobiography. A slightly wanky one, if it comes to that, I felt as I started it \u2013 after the plain matteroffactness of Thompson, Duras seemed on the hysterically dramatic side.Then again, who wouldn\u2019t be? Thompson writes about the half starved. Duras writes of the 95% starved. I don\u2019t know how to put that. People who are literally skin and bones as they come back, those few who do, from the camps of Nazi Germany, people who are so close to death that food is going to kill them as surely as lack of it will, people whose skeletons can\u2019t bear the tiny weight on them. I have no way of describing the horrors recorded here and to quote bits and pieces would seem plain disrespectful.I did need some pages to adjust to the girly, introspective way Duras sets out her story here, but then, it was never supposed to be a story, not like that. It was what she wrote at the time for herself, trying to hang on to what was left of her sanity as she waited for her husband to come back during the period in which the prisoners were set free from the Nazi camps. She has some moments of marvelous acidity as she describes how some of the French take advantage of the new political situation. She is no friend of de Gaulle, who sounds like a right creep the way she tells it.It turned out that being ashamed of America in the Depression wasn\u2019t the half of it.Lately I seem to keep on \u2013 completely coincidentally \u2013 reading books that pair each other in some significant way and here again, it\u2019s happened. It\u2019s an odd request, but I\u2019m making it. These books go together. Get them and read them back to back. It\u2019ll be totally worth it, I promise!Afterthought:I went to see de Santiago Amigorena's Another silence recently and it deals, as does Duras, with the issue of revenge. What a fine contrast. The heroine, whose husband and child are murdered, sets about revenge as coldly as does Duras in the story where she talks about torturing a collaborator, but in the end, faced with the perpetrator, a piece of Argentinian trash, she not only can't kill him, but she even grants him a gesture of mercy. The difference? Maybe that in Another Silence she meets the wife and child of the killer of her family. Maybe Duras is able to torture people with the objectivity of principle because her victim doesn't look human.Then again, maybe it is part of her own terrible guilt. It transpires that Duras - all the time she was suffering in such a melodramatic way that she confesses 'D' chastises her and points out she should be ashamed of how she is behaving - is in love with 'D' and planning to tell her husband as soon as she can, if he comes back, that she wants a divorce. No wonder she has to behave as if she is suffering all that he is, even though she can only play at that.I don't think this detracts from the book, it simply adds a layer of human behaviour which may repel the reader, but is no less readable for that."], ["\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0646\u06cc

Perhaps being brave is my form of cowardice.\"I just realized that I have not reviewed this book yet.Part of the reason for my lapse is that there is never anything to say about war. About the Holocaust. About torture. About death.Or rather, there is too much to say that I never know where to begin.Besides Marguerite said it all already in this book.Which is in itself impressive. She says it all in here without falling into the typical trappings of saying it all about such a subject.Without sentimentality. In fact with the opposite of sentimentality.\"There's no point in killing him. And there's no longer any point in letting him live. ... And just because there's no point in killing him, we can go ahead and do it.\"She goes to the very edge of emotional experience and is somehow able to write about it almost as it was going on, and it doesn't turn out like an overly emotional teenager's drivel (I just realized after I wrote this that it may be read as a subtle criticism of Anne Frank, but it's not intended that way, I haven't read her since high school, so can't speak on that front).Part of the reason this is impressive is that to go to the very edge of emotional experience is an entirely different beast than to write out that experience on paper. To affect a reader in that way requires going to a different place inside of oneself after much silence, quite separate from the edge of experience that is experienced while in the midst of experiencing the edge of experience.Duras was able to do that seemingly in the moment. At the edge and not at the edge at the same time. How?Maybe the war divides us, divides our experience, so that we can talk about the missing cheese in the same sentence as we talk about the death of a traitor (as they do in one of the later chapters here).Death and cheese, Duras understood, normally existed on different planes of human experience. But in wartime there is only one plane of human experience. Human experience becomes one dimensional. There are no hierarchies of objects.

What I love about BOH is what I love about the best of literary pulp: it finds a way to erase the high culture/low culture divide. Suffice to say, the hero here is an art critic, ambitious, underhanded, entirely comfortable with his greedy-seediness. The story makes you think how much more fun and interesting Edmund Wilson, Kenneth Rexroth, and even Rex Reed would be if they were homicidal maniacs. I'm sure there's a book somewhere about the specific aesthetic theory Willeford employs throughout the narrative, but I'll leave it to others to explore that. Just rest assured if you know even a smitch about Marcel Duchamp and subsequent 1920s Dada/surrealism you'll get a chuckle out of some of the descriptions of the old master painter's work. Who knew so much could be made out of a nail hole, which comes to serve as a significant plot pivot? There are those who say the plot slags a bit in the middle, but when the critic breaks bad the pace more than picks up.

As much a commentary on criticism and art as a character study and dark thriller.A lot of times when a writer attempts to delve into an exotic arena (in this case, the art world), even with research, the setting can come off more as how the writer wants the art world to be or how he/she thinks it is (This is best illustrated by the \"punk rock\" episode of \"T.J. Hooker\". The 50 year-old writer had obviously read an article in time on \"punkers\" and used that as the entire basis for his representation, failing miserably). So when you read a book where the writer is obviously someone writing within an arena they know, the detail and depth glows. Who knew that Willeford had a thesis on the nature of art criticism in him?This is also the best written book, purely in terms of language, that I have read by Willeford. Spare, but descriptive. Poetic, yet stern.Deserves to be consideredthe classic that it is."], ["Willeford is a talented writer but the first 2/3rds of the book sort of bored me. I get the appeal of art and art criticism but I don't have much interest in reading books about it, even short ones like this. But that final 1/3rd...wow. Once things get set in motion, Willeford's set up about what nihilistic surrealism is and how it functions with regards to the story and what he's trying to say as an author pays off in an enormous way, right up to the thrilling conclusion. I will be thinking about this book for a long time."], ["The book starts out a little slow. A lot of the first act is the narrator/protagonist, an art critic trying to break into the big time, musing on the nature of art criticism and the role it plays as a service, not just to consumers and patrons of art, but the artists themselves. It\u2019s not as boring as it sounds. He takes a pretty dense piece of subject matter and breaks it down into pretty simple lay terms, even using sports analogies. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he was satirizing critics or dispatching his own critical manifesto through the narrator. The latter is probably unlikely given that the narrator believes artist and critic should maintain defined roles: critics shouldn\u2019t make art, and artists shouldn\u2019t write criticism. Of course, in real life, in addition to being a writer, soldier, horse trainer, and amateur boxer, Willeford was also a painter and an art critic\u2014hardly a man who believed in singular obsession. Hang in there. The first act sets up a pretty riveting second and third act, and what may have seemed long-winded and pretentious is actually very clever foreshadowing. After putting this book down, I realized it was a very lean, concise thriller. It was also smart and informative. Without giving too much away, the narrator finds himself compromising each of his previously stated professional ethics one by one until finally he passes a point of no return. Like a lot of Willeford\u2019s novels, there\u2019s a female accessory to the protagonist, a somewhat ditzy but attractive girlfriend. But in the third act, she proves rather perceptive, doing a surprisingly good job of putting the facts together. The narrator\u2019s underestimations of her intelligence drive the plot to its climax, which is dark, brutal, and sparingly well-written in a compelling way, a Charles Willeford trademark."], ["This is the first Willeford book that I've read that was a bit of a dud to me (not counting the collection of posthumously published short stories). It starts slow, the middle is slow, the end is sort of exciting for like 3 pages, and then it's all slow again. I could not stand the narrator. And unlike with most of Willeford's other protagonists (none of whom are all that likeable) I couldn't find one aspect of Figueras that I could tolerate. I would not ever want to be in the same room as that dude, lest I get stuck listening to him pontificate about contemporary art, which--SPOILER ALERT--is what he does for the entire novel. SHUT UP YOU ARE BORING. I think maybe if he would have been developed a bit more into perhaps a Harvey Pekar-type I could have related to him a bit more. Not that one should ever really relate to Willeford's characters, but at least he'd be more well rounded and less of a droning asshole. The exciting three pages are good, but still not great, and not nearly enough to save this, although good enough to get it 2 stars versus 1. Also, the actual ending? HATED IT.And, seriously, Willeford, can I get like one female character who isn't deplorable? At this point, I'm not even asking for a strong female character, just one who does something aside from drink, have sex, ask annoying questions, and get in the way. I think I'm more of a fan of Willeford's later stuff. I like the ultra violence. And I like a crime gotten away with from time to time. And, yes, goddamnit, I like Hoke Moseley."], ["Willeford wrote this noir about an art critic trying to advance his career by taking advantage of a hermetic artist. The artist has built a juggernaut reputation on rarely exhibiting his work. The elements are goofy but the tone is dark deadpan. Instead of guns, dames, drugs, and jewels, Willeford's characters jockey for galleries, graduate school grants, art history articles, critical and artistic reputations with the intensity of mobsters and PIs. The book reminded me of Pynchon, though with far less characters; however, Willeford has a formalist determination to play the noir all the way to the end with a straight face without using silly songs as levity to break the tension. The tension persists throughout the book, and art criticism becomes a bleak business. Reasons why I think the book is currently OOP: 1. dated descriptions of technology: early Polaroid cameras, flashcubes, typewriters. (Note to self, if ever I write, stay away from extended descriptions of new technology).2. dated clothing: jumpsuits, bell bottoms. (Though I liked the 70s atmosphere). 3. One would have to have a grounding in noir in order to appreciate that Willeford used silly elements and yet stayed true to tone and form. So, actual noir gets printed before joke-noir or meta-satiric noir."], ["This a very clever little book about what happens when you become fixated on acquiring social position. Unlike in B. E. Ellis' American Psycho, this is not an attempt to imagine the inner world of a textbook psychiatric category. We are not in a world where all empathy and moralising is alien and absurd. Willeford creates the more believable scenario of someone who is drawn towards their goals with such focus and ferocity of speed, everything else falls out of view, including the autonomy of those immediately around him.While Burnt Orange Heresy is supposed to be Willeford's most critically acclaimed work, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be in print any more. This is a shame since there are far less deserving works still being pressed into circulation. Willeford had a fine understanding of human motive and a pretty good ear for dialog too."], ["Been meaning to read this one for a while. It fits in my back pocket, so I thought it would be good to take on my trip to Monterey/Big Sur. Charles Willeford is continually fascinating as a writer. There is nothing flashy about this book at all, but it is fantastic. His characters can always rationalize any ridiculous or insane action. This book's protagonist is no exception to that rule. Perhaps the most interested thing of all to me in Willeford's late writings (say this one and the Hoke Moseley stuff) is his characters' insistence on wearing jumpsuits. I don't know, that's just weird and wonderful to me. Apparently, they are very handy to wear and comfortable.

You are already zapped of energy. You feel like going to a bar and have a couple of beer listening to a funky live band or the crooning of a lovely young lady. Or you want to go to a nearby mall and sit in the comfort of a dark movie house. Probably sleep to rest for a couple of hours if the movie turns out to be boring.But you decide to go as you planned at the start of the day. Your gym bag is in your car. You drag your heavy feet to the parking lot. To the gym. You know you have to do it your friend has been telling you that Henry James is good but you imagine the taste of cold beer quenching your thirst or the soft seat inside the theater or the pretty songbird wearing a plunging neckline or showing her slim smooth legs there are quick reads waiting for you like Ray Bradbury\u2019s Farenheit 451 or that Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes. But you know your body needs exercise. You are becoming fatter, heavier and your waistline is expanding. You resisted the quick but empty lure of beer or sleep at the movie house. Your heart is telling you that Henry James is an author to read. Like a zombie, you continued sleepwalking to the gym.After changing to your gym attire. You step on the treadmill. The solitude of working out. In the gym, you rarely talk to anyone. Henry James used a style that was distinctively his: wordy yet illuminating You are by yourself. Most of your friends don\u2019t care about Henry James. You begin to walk. Warm up. After a couple of minutes, you increase the speed. Chug. Chug. Chug. It goes on and on. His storytelling went on and on. His characters came from New York, to England, went to Paris, then to Rome and then went back to England and finally went back to Rome. After the treadmill, you lift some weights as you also need to tone some muscles. His characters were varied. There was Isabel Archer fighting for her independence by refusing marriage proposals like there was not tomorrow but in the end she found with the wrong man: conceited, two-timer, treacherous and condescending. Some muscles are not supposed to be exercised right after a neighboring one. They could be contradicting each other and not only you will not get the maximum benefit from your workout but you are in the danger of having an injury like some pulled muscles.

Some people agonize reading this kind of 19th century Victorian English But when you came out to go back to your car, you felt energized and refreshed. You felt triumphant that Isabel Archer was going back to Rome for Pansy not necessarily for Oswald. But she decided whatever her heart was telling her. In the end, it was all that mattered: independence. She followed her heart: a personal triumph.  In the end, you did not regret going to the gym. In the end, I am happy I read a Henry James."], ["10 Things I Love About Henry James\u2019s The Portrait Of A Lady1. Isabel ArcherThe \u201clady\u201d in the title. Beautiful, young, headstrong and spirited, the American woman visits her wealthy relatives in England, rejects marriage proposals by two worthy suitors, inherits a fortune and then is manipulated into marrying one of the most odious creatures on the planet, Gilbert Osmond. She\u2019s utterly fascinating, and if I were back in university, I imagine having long conversations and arguments about her character. What does she want: Freedom? The ability to choose, even if it\u2019s a bad choice? Is she a projection of James\u2019s latent homosexuality? Is she a feminist or not? There are no simple answers. 2. The Prose and Psychological ComplexityDamn, James knew how to write long, luxuriant sentences that dig deep into his characters\u2019 minds. Sometimes the effect can be claustrophobic \u2013 get me out of this person\u2019s head! \u2013 but more often it\u2019s utterly compelling and convincing. We partly read fiction to learn about other people\u2019s lives, right? Well, James does that. (The exceptions: Isabel\u2019s two wealthy, handsome suitors, Warburton and Goodwood, are less than believable, and remind me of eager (or horny?) dogs, their tails wagging whenever they\u2019re around their love/lust object.)3. The StoryOkay, not much really happens. But as the book progressed, even though I sort of knew the outcome (it\u2019s hard to avoid spoilers from a 135-year-old classic), I was increasingly curious to see how Isabel would act. In fact, I raced through the final chapters, breathlessly. Who knew: Henry James, page-turner! And have a theory about that ending? Take your turn...4. The HumourIt\u2019s not a comedy, but there are lots of amusing bits. James\u2019s narrator is genial and funny. Henrietta Stackpole, her gentleman friend, Mr. Bantling, and even Gilbert Osmond\u2019s sister, the Countess Gemini, are all very colourful characters who elicit a chuckle or two. And Isabel\u2019s aunt can be terribly cutting as well. I love Ralph (Isabel's cousin) and the dignified British Lord Warburton\u2019s reactions to the enterprising, no-fuss American \u201clady journalist\u201d Henrietta. 5. The SettingsEach one is significant: from the stately Gardencourt, home of Isabel\u2019s relatives the Touchetts, to the bustle and anonymity of London, to the ruins of Rome, where Isabel finds herself stuck in a dead, fossilized marriage. James is a master at finding the right place to stage a scene. I could write an essay about interiors and exteriors in the book, but I\u2019ll spare you.6. The VillainsMadame Merle and Gilbert Osmond: individually they\u2019re sinister, but together they\u2019re positively Machiavellian. In fact, in one scene, it\u2019s revealed that they both like Machiavelli, and Isabel doesn\u2019t get the clue! They totally play her. And yet they\u2019re believable, too. Osmond\u2019s scene in which he professes his love is brilliant in its manipulation; and the final turn of the screw (asking her to do him a favour!) is very clever. Madame Merle\u2019s motivations always keep you guessing. Does she see herself in Isabel? Is she jealous? Does she just want to exert her power over her? The scene in which Isabel sees both in her home, conspiring (evident from their attitudes) is so powerful James refers to it a couple of times. And of course, it\u2019s missing from the Jane Campion film (see below).7. The ThemesDoes money corrupt? What do you really know about someone before you marry? What is the true nature of freedom? What happens when New World (American) \"innocence\" meets Old World (European) \"experience\"? All these themes \u2013 and many others \u2013 come across naturally, and never feel shoe-horned into the story.8. The TechniqueI remember hearing people go on about the architecture of Henry James\u2019s novels, and this one is sturdily, handsomely built. The book begins and ends in the same setting. And there are some ingenious sections in the middle, where time has passed and the reader discovers major information through conversations. Like any great writer, James knows what to leave out. He makes you do work to fill in the pieces, but the novel becomes more memorable because of that. And he bridges the Victorian and Modern eras, in the same way that Beethoven bridges the Classical and Romantic eras.9. Chapter 42After a huge blowup with Osmond, Isabel stays up all night, staring into the fireplace, and ponders her life, thinking: \"How did I get here?\" James considered it one of the best things he\u2019d ever written, and although I haven\u2019t read a lot of his work (which I will soon remedy), I\u2019d have to agree. It\u2019s right up there with Hamlet\u2019s soliloquies.10. The Fact that the Book Doesn't Lend Itself Well To Adaptation A couple days after finishing the book, I watched the Campion film starring Nicole Kidman. Besides an evocative score and a brilliant performance by Barbara Hershey as Madame Merle and a suitably slimy one by John Malkovich (basically changing costumes from his Dangerous Liaisons character), it was dreadfully dull. There have been other James adaptations \u2013 The Wings Of The Dove, The Golden Bowl, The Bostonians \u2013 but none of these films has achieved the critical or popular success of an Age Of Innocence, Howards End or Room With A View. Maybe it's hard to get that psychological complexity onscreen? Read the books.***Conclusion: James is The Master. Up til now, I\u2019d only read his shorter works, like the novellas \u201cThe Turn Of The Screw,\u201d \u201cDaisy Miller\u201d (I still don\u2019t quite know what killed her - sorry if that\u2019s a spoiler) and \u201cThe Beast In The Jungle.\u201d Now I\u2019m eyeing his other major novels; perhaps I\u2019ll even get through the notoriously difficult late period James. Can't wait to try!"], ["For my dear friend Jeffrey Keeten: I would not have read it if it were not for you. Thanks! Henry James\u2019 The Portrait of a Lady touched me deeply. Since I finished this novel a few days ago, I could not seem to stop thinking about it as I tried to organize my feelings. That I was mesmerized by it, there is no doubt. So much that the search for its understanding has occupied practically all my free moments. And to fully grasp it I could not do without Henry James masterful help, so forgive me if you find I quote him too often. Oh, but this is a work in progress, so forgive me again for any inaccuracy or inconsistency. 1. The complexity of Isabel Archer\n\"Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The novel is of its very nature an ado, an ado about something, and the larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore, consciously, that was what one was in for\u2014for positively organising an ado about Isabel Archer.\"\nPortrait of a Lady is the story of a young American woman, Isabel Archer, and her voyage of self-discovery. I loved getting into Isabel's conflicted mind, her doubts and her confidence, her wishes and her choices. I went even further and identified thoroughly with Isabel Archer. I could relate to her conflicted mind, her dreams and ultimate choices. She was a pleasure to know, because she is so extraordinarily complex, complex in a way that fictional people seldom are.From the first we learn how Isabel valued her freedom, in a dialogue with her cousin Ralph:\n\"\u2018Adopted me?\u2019 The girl stared, and her blush came back to her, together with a momentary look of pain...\u2018Oh no; she has not adopted me. I\u2019m not a candidate for adoption.\u2019\u2018I beg a thousand pardons,\u2019 Ralph murmured. \u2018I meant... \u2018You meant she has taken me up. Yes; she likes to take people up... but,\u2019 she added with a certain visible eagerness of desire to be explicit, \u2018I\u2019m very fond of my liberty.\u2019\"\nThe secondary characters are there to explain Isabel Archer, as Henry James tells us \u201cthey are there, for what they are worth\u2026 the definite array of contributions to Isabel Archer\u2019s history. I recognized them, I knew them, they were numbered pieces of my puzzle, the concrete term of my \u2018plot\u2019.\u201dMrs. Touchett, her aunt, brings Isabel to Europe but is indifferent and unfeeling; Ralph is initially amused by her and helps her to inherit a fortune, only to guarantee her choices and the freedom to follow them (he probably is the only one that thoroughly loved Isabel); Madam Merle manages her meeting with Osmond and makes sure they end up married; Osmond thinks of her as one more item for his collection; Mr. Goodwood is persistent and never loses interest in her life (coming back again and again to see how she is), but seems to offer nothing more; Lord Warburton is a fair aristocratic friend to Isabel, but was he truly in love with her or merely looking for a trophy wife?; Henrietta Stackpole, is a true friend and probably an antithesis to Isabel; and Pansy, the artless creation of her husband, depends on Isabel as the only person who throughly loves her. So everyone, including the reader, look upon her, judge her decisions and contemplate as she takes each of her fateful steps into her destiny.Oh, there is much more about Isabel, and I hope I will be able to know her better once I am finished.2. The images and metaphors of Isabel Archer\u2019s lifeTo discuss this I first I want to tell you about a recurrent dream I had for a very long time. Sometimes, I dreamed that I was walking down the corridor on my home and discovered a door I had never realized existed; deciding to explore I would open it and it led me to a new, endless row of rooms, all grand with high windows and sunny, overlooking majestic gardens that I had never observed existed before. As I opened each door amazing new discoveries were revealed to me. My feelings were of exuberance, of happiness to have discovered so much beauty inside my home. But there was a variation to these recurrent dreams, or worst, there were also nightmares. In these I also discovered new places never visited before, however they would be dark and looked nowhere. As a result of this oppressive atmosphere I used to feel like I was in an endless prison inside my own home. I rejoiced in the first and feared to revisit those nightmares.So, when I started reading The Portrait of a Lady, it was fascinating to read how Henry James uses symbolic or metaphorical architectural spaces and places to tell us about Isabel Archer and her life. This was something I knew and it remitted directly to my dreams and my deepest self. \n\"Her imagination was by habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging.\"\nWe first meet Isabel at Gardencourt,\n\"Her uncle\u2019s house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need. The large, low rooms, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the centre of a \u2018property\u2019\u2014...much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions\"\nBy marrying Osmond Isabel ends up enveloped in a palace dark and suffocating:\n\"She could live it over again, the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling. Between those four walls she had lived ever since; they were to surround her for the rest of her life. It was the house of darkness, the house of dumbness, the house of suffocation. Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air; Osmond\u2019s beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her.\"\nThere, she seeks refuge or consolation on the ruins of Rome, for her a symbol of hope for despite their long sufferings they are still standing.\n\"She had long before this taken old Rome into her confidence, for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe. She rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright; she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places, so that as she sat in a sun-warmed angle on a winter\u2019s day, she could smile at it and think of its smallness.\"\nBut, ultimately, she seeks refuge once more at Gardencourt.\n\"All purpose, all intention, was suspended; all desire too save the single desire to reach her much-embracing refuge. Gardencourt had been her starting-point, and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return. She had gone forth in her strength; she would come back in her weakness, and if the place had been a rest to her before, it would be a sanctuary now.\"\n3. Isabel\u2019s choices and freedomIsabel's ability to choose, and the choices she makes are the thread that is carefully woven throughout the novel, and it raises her stature as a fictional heroine, in my opinion, to the level of that of an Anna Karenina or an Emma Bovary. For better or for worse. \n\"\u2018I\u2019m not bent on a life of misery,\u2019 said Isabel. \u2018I\u2019ve always been intensely determined to be happy, and I\u2019ve often believed I should be. I\u2019ve told people that. But it comes over me every now and then that I can never be happy in any extraordinary way; not by turning away, by separating myself.\u2019\u2018By separating yourself from what?\u2019\u2018From life. From the usual chances and dangers, from what most people know and suffer.\u2019\"\nThe moment Isabel inherits starts the process whereupon she loses some of her freedom\u2026\n\"There\u2019s one remarkable clause in my husband\u2019s will,\u2019 Mrs Touchett added. \u2018He has left my niece a fortune.\u2019\u2018A fortune!\u2019 Madame Merle softly repeated.\u2018Isabel steps into something like seventy thousand pounds.\u2019Madame Merle\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap; at this she raised them, still clasped, and held them a moment against her bosom while her eyes, a little dilated... \u2018Ah,\u2019 she cried, \u2018the clever creature!\u2019\"\nAnd around Isabel there is always a sense of danger: \n\"\u2018I try to care more about the world than about myself\u2013\u2013but I always come back to myself. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 She stopped; her voice had trembled a little. \u2018Yes, I\u2019m afraid; I can\u2019t tell you. A large fortune means freedom, and I\u2019m afraid of that. It\u2019s such a fine thing, and one should make such a good use of it. If one shouldn\u2019t one would be ashamed... I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s not a greater happiness to be powerless.\u2019\"\nBut was she really free or were her choices not as free as she dreamed? Or was it all inevitable to some degree? It seems that Isabel Archer's life was to some extend inescapable and this fact was not totally unknown to her. However, she thoroughly recongnizes how misguided she had been in her choice of husband. \n\"It was as if he had had the evil eye; as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune. Was the fault in himself, or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him? This mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life; a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered.\"\nSubsequentely, Isabel remains too proud to show it to the her friends. But despite all her efforts to conceal her misery, she cannot camouflage it from Ralph and Caspar: \n\"\u2018Watching her?\u2019\u2018Trying to make out if she's happy.\u2019\u2018That's easy to make out,\u2019 said Ralph. \u2018She\u2019s the most visibly happy woman I know.\u2019\u2018Exactly so; I\u2019m satisfied,\u2019 Goodwood answered dryly. For all his dryness, however, he had more to say. \u2018I\u2019ve been watching her. She pretends to be happy; that was what she undertook to be; and I thought I should like to see for myself what it amounts to. I\u2019ve seen,\u2019 he continued with a harsh ring in his voice, \u2018and I don\u2019t want to see any more. I\u2019m now quite ready to go.\u2019\"\nSorrowful and heartbroken, that's how this passage made me feel. But she is never to be pitied, she always stands upright despite doomed adversity. Yes, I suspect there is a sense of inevitability (what choices did she have, where her other suitors conductive of real happiness? I think not!) which could have made Isabel Archer\u2019s into a tragedy. But she is far from it, she still has choices. Nevertheless, James\u2019 work is not merely that. It is a reflection upon the ideal of a relative freedom and a play with its execution in a woman\u2019s life; the actions, its struggles and the consequent decisions taken by choice. This is what James has achieved with this work; that liberty is not only an ideal but a responsibility too. Though the reader may not approve of all her choices at the end, keeping in mind the betrayal of trust brought about by Madam Merle and Osmond, they were all freely taken or the result of her own will. A will which comes not merely from the limitations imposed by society, but by a newfound maturity, result of all her suffering, and above all from the vow to remain true to oneself. 4. Henry James gives the reader plenty of room to imagineThere\u2019s something about Henry James\u2019 work, and here in particular, that flares, tosses back and forth with unspoken frustration and desire. James\u2019 art, the one thing that makes him stand out for me, is in how he somehow implies, suggests, hints, but never outright tells the reader the ins and outs of his story. He even skips years, and it only adds to its enjoyment. If you want to live along with Isabel Archer, and I felt like I did, is to be conquered by infinite possibilities. Here we are not mere spectator or bystanders but may live everything along with her, if we want to. It is a hard reading that requires effort, but if we invest in it we can grasp the possibilities the whole world that exists beneath the surface of his work.5. Her ultimate choiceIsabel falls for Gilbert Osmond, to my mind, partly because he does not mindlessly adore her, does not fawn over her. He takes his time in the courtship, he (with the help of Madame Merle) has a clear strategy and it works. He is mysterious, indolent; and there is the hint of a darker side. He appears to be tired of everything, simply bored, so Isabel feels like for once she is helping somebody. That her inheritance has a meaning, a destiny. She seems to feel recompensated and fulfilled.\n\"...\u2018What has he ever done?\u2019 he added abruptly.\u2018That I should marry him? Nothing at all,\u2019 Isabel replied while her patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness. \u2018If he had done great things would you forgive me any better? Give me up, Mr Goodwood; I\u2019m marrying a perfect nonentity. Don\u2019t try to take an interest in him. You can\u2019t.\u2019\"\nAnd we are not the only ones to be surprised by her choice to marry Gilbert Osmond. Ralph was appalled:\n\"\u2018I think I\u2019ve hardly got over my surprise,\u2019 he went on at last. \u2018You were the last person I expected to see caught.\u2019\u2018I don\u2019t know why you call it caught.\u2019\u2018Because you\u2019re going to be put into a cage.\u2019\u2018If I like my cage, that needn\u2019t trouble you,\u2019 she answered....\u2018You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.\u2019\"\nBut she still has another choice ahead of her. Her ultimate choice is whether or not to return to Osmond after she goes to Gardencourt to visit her dying cousin. Again Henry James gifts us with a superb image that could not translate better the pervading dread of what she is about to do:\n\"There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, trying not to think. She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started.\"\nAnd at last we understand her ultimate decision, although such resolution is not easily reached. \n\"There were lights in the windows of the house; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time\u2014for the distance was considerable\u2014she had moved through the darkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then she put her hand on the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a very straight path.\"\nIn the end I recognized a worthier and more mature Isabel Archer, and I think that she comes out of her sufferings stronger. I would like to imagine Osmond would be surprised by her when she gets back to Rome, and that she would be able to change her standing. Their roles perhaps altered. Although there should certainly be more anguish ahead of her, given what she is going back to, I imagine there is always the possibility of happiness.______"], ["I've been reading a lot of Anthony Trollope's books recently and the stories, characters and writing is so much superior to this that I just can't get into it. \"Frothy\" is a word that comes to mind, also \"was he paid by the word?\" like Dickens. I finished the book, finally. It was a chore. I did not find James' portrayal of a woman's personality convincing. That even though she had the financial power which was the reason why her husband had married her, she would still allow herself to be physically and emotionally abused and humiliated. It seemed to be a very conventional view of a woman, that eventually she would give in to her Lord and Master. A woman with an ounce of independence (she did have an ounce, maybe even two) at the beginning would not be the sad creature she was at the end. Marriages were made in light of money and status in those times, in this book, she had both, he had neither, there had to be some sort of mental shift that that would allow her to pretend that these were her husband's and she was in the lower and grateful position. But James didn't write it, so 'Portrait' really didn't make sense.None of the characters, evil, good or milk-water gained my sympathy. Pansy, the daughter, nearly did, but I wanted to shake her and say 'how could you have lived all these years and not suspected who your mother is? Your father has palmed you off on the nuns all these years, what's with this unquestioning obedience? Its your step-mother has the money, not him, she's the one who can help you, would help you,not your daddy who just wants you to achieve his own social-climbing ambitions'. I just don't see James as a man who understood women enough to write about them from any but a man's perspective.I watched the Nichole Kidman film of the book and although Kidman did her best to flesh out the character she was no more rounded than in the book. And Poppy's submissiveness and ignorance were even more unbelievable. Obviously, to James, the main characteristic he associated with women and interpreted thusly by the director, was submissiveness.Henry James may have deserved his reputation as a Grand Old Man of (American) letters, but not through this book, it just didn't do it for me."], ["I had many wonderful moments while reading this book, moments when the writing halted the reading, when I had to pause and admire and wonder. Moments when the book seemed to speak to my own experience as if it were written expressly for the girl who was me at twenty-two, causing me to wonder how Henry James could have guessed so well the presumptuous ideas I had about life and love at that early stage. All of that is very personal, of course, and not necessarily of interest to other readers, but there were other moments in my reading of The Portrait of a Lady that better merit mention in a review. I had read this book before, about twenty years ago, so although I knew the bare bones of the story, I remembered few of the details. I certainly had no recollection of the early scene in which Isabel Archer walks in on an unknown guest in her aunt\u2019s house. And yet there was something about the lead-up to that scene that caught my attention this time: the house is very still because Isabel\u2019s uncle is dying. Out of the silence comes the sound of someone playing the piano. Wonderingly, Isabel makes her way toward the source of the harmony. Those six words were like a bell ringing in my mind. I felt a sharpening of interest, an awareness of how pivotal this moment would be in the story. I remember thinking: I've been reading this book with all senses on alert and this is my reward; I've sensed the author\u2019s excitement at the turn his story is about to take. There was another scene later in the book when I had a similar feeling of change about to happen: Isabel sits up late one night in Rome pondering a difficult decision, indeed pondering all the decisions in her life so far. The reader watches with her and wonders how she will act. And wonders again when she finally does.There are other major shifts in the narrative but none stood out for me quite the way those two did. In fact, Henry James purposely avoids describing the most significant shift of all, skipping a three-year section of Isabel\u2019s life completely - which is a very effective narrative device of course, introducing both surprise and suspense in a story that has only a six-year span in total. As a reader I appreciated both strategies: the emphasis he seemed to place on some scenes and the complete omission he allowed to others. It was all very wonderful. In fact this book has revised my idea of what \u2018wonderful\u2019 means. 'The Portrait of a Lady' is vying for a place as the highlight of my Henry James reading year even though The Ambassadors was already firmly camped in that position. I've decided they can be the joint highlight - they have a lot of wonderfulness in common.When I finished 'The Portrait', I turned to HJ\u2019s 1906 appendix and found a paragraph about his concerns for the reader. He writes that he has purposely piled brick upon brick for our benefit, carefully including the details that will enable us to grasp the totality of his creation. And among those details, he mentions two in particular, keystones in the building of the story as it were. The first is the piano scene I described earlier. He speaks of the rare chemistry of that scene in which Isabel recognizes that a huge change is about to happen in her life. I felt really validated as a reader to have been aware in advance of the significance of what I was about to read, and so I wasn't surprised when his other pivotal scene turned out to be the one where Isabel sits up late into the Roman night, pondering her decisions. This is the sixteenth Henry James book I've read in six months. Perhaps I've learnt something of the way his writer\u2019s mind works!More confirmation of that possibility came when he began to discuss the shape of this novel. He continues to speak in terms of bricks and architecture and proportions, and he says that of all his novels, 'The Portrait' is the best proportioned with the exception of a novel he was to write twenty-two years later: The Ambassadors. Alongside a certain \u2018roundness\u2019 in shape which they share, he finds they also share a kind of supporting beam or rib that runs through them. This rib is made from two minor but key characters, Henrietta Stackpole and Maria Gostrey. Both seem extraneous to each story at first glance yet both are central to the architecture of their particular story. I remember noting that Maria Gostrey was the thread that allowed me to find my way through the labyrinth that was 'The Ambassadors' so it was wonderful to hear Henry James confirm that, and underline the links between the two books as well. I was also reminded that I had begun to look at his books in terms of architecture while reading The Wings of the Dove, so I really appreciated his architectural metaphors.In fact the appendix left me amazed and wondering at every turn. In the updates, I quoted part of a paragraph on his theories about the \u2018house of fiction\u2019. I'd like to quote the whole thing here because it is really worth reading - and it provided me with huge insights into some Gerald Murnane books I've puzzled over in the past, The Plains and Inland, and offered a strong desire to read his Million Windows:The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million - a number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbors are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; \u201cfortunately\u201d by reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the \u201cchoice of subject\u201d; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the \u201cliterary form\u201d; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher without, in other words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once his boundless freedom and his \u201cmoral\u201d reference.\u2026\u2026\u2026This book is the final one in my 2017 Henry James season and I can't think of a better title to finish on. But in every ending there are beginnings - 'The Portrait' has led me to another book: Henry James says he took the slight \u2018personality\u2019, the mere slim shade of an intelligent but presumptuous girl and created what he called \u2018an ado about Isabel Archer\u2019. That reference has prompted me to go back to Shakespeare and read Much Ado About Nothing. I do love when one book leads to another!"], ["Ugh, ech, the elitism that breeds in readers! We think we're such nicey cosy bookworms and wouldn't harm a fly but we seethe, we do. Of course, readers of books just naturally look down on those who don't read at all. In fact they try not to think of those people (nine tenths of the human race I suppose, but a tenth of the human race is still a big number) because it makes them shudder. (How lovely it would be to go riding in a carriage through some dreadful council estate flinging free copies of Ulysses and Mrs Dalloway right and left (although Ulysses might catch some of those urchins a hefty blow on the temple (which might cause a shift in their brain landscape and evoke a sudden craving for modernist novels, like when people are struck by a bus and wake up talking in a French accent, that can happen))). So that's one obvious kind of reader elitism. But then, some readers think that what the majority of readers actually read is appalling (Hungervinciboneskitehelpslappery Twilit Shades of Pottery doo dah). It's not that you read, it's what you read. Of course. And then, amongst those elevated readers, some literary authors are considered greater than some others (why are you wasting your time with William Gaddis when you could be knee-deep in Proust, dwarling? I simply don't understand it). And then, even when you scale the heights and find yourself munching down some Henry James like he was the last well-done steak (with Chateau Lafleur) you were going to get before your solo trek (no huskies) to the south pole, you still get it - oh dwarling, why are you still dillydallying in the Middle Period when you still haven't read The Golden Bowl you naughty Jamesian you!Thus it is that I say - oh no, not The Portrait of a Lady. Too too obvious. Try The Awkward Age or The Ambassadors. Much better."], ["Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady is considered to be one of the first American novels to make full use of social and psychological realism as European authors - such as Flaubert, Balzac and George Eliot - were already practicing in their works. Considered to be his biggest accomplishment along with The Ambassadors, Portrait added Isabel Archer to the company of great fictional heroines - as the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, Becky Sharp and Jane Eyre - and, in a century marked by unsatisfied bourgeois wives and adultery in fiction - Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina come to mind -, it was a breath of fresh air to accompany and delve into James' protagonist's thoughts and inner feelings.Starting with a very slow pace, the narrative contains long and elaborate descriptions. It feels James is painting a richly detailed picture for every scene. As we arrive in Gardencourt - the Touchett's English country estate where our story opens and closes -, we encounter Mr. Touchett, his son Ralph and a family friend called Lord Warburton. Among other things, they discuss how Mrs. Lydia Touchett is in America and will bring along her niece called Isabel Archer to visit Europe.Isabel is a young woman, from Albany, New York, who accepts her aunt's offer to initially stay with her in Gardencourt and then later travel through the continent, eager to explore and be enriched by the places she's never been before and experience life at its fullest. Upon her arrival, we begin to learn what her ideals and plans are, along with her hopes and dreams.Since the beginning, her cousin Ralph seems to have been as curious as we were to see what Isabel would make of her life. In a way, we almost could say Ralph was conducting an experiment: Isabel had an independent mind, she was emotionally and psychologically self-sufficient - didn't seem inclined to get married for the time being, which was different for a girl of her age at the time. She was thirsty for knowledge first and foremost: \u201cI don\u2019t want to begin life by marrying\u201d, Isabel asserts to Ralph. \u201cThere are other things a woman can do.\" But without money, how far could she go with her unattached ways? She was probably bound to eventually getting married. Her cousin, then, arranged it and she became financially independent as well. Certain that he was doing Isabel a good deed, Ralph convinced his father - who was very fond of Isabel - at his deathbed to leave her an impressive amount of money. Now she had all that was necessary to decide her destiny without any barriers or anyone to hold her back. The experiment was on.After traveling for over a year, the now wealthy Isabel Archer is in Florence, where her aunt lives. A friend she greatly admired, Madame Merle - Mrs. Touchett's close friend who Isabel got acquainted with some time after she arrived in Gardencourt - skillfully introduces her to Gilbert Osmond: an American expatriate widower who's lived in Italy for years. Isabel is very impressed with his refinement and intelligence and thinks of him as having a beautiful mind. Despite her family and friends complaints about this relationship, Isabel - after having declined two previous suitors - accepts Osmond's marriage proposal.The story then jumps in time and there's a narrative shift: for a bit, James leaves Isabel and Osmond in the background while he focuses on Pansy Osmond - Osmond's young daughter - and Edward Rosier - Isabel's childhood friend who's in love with Miss Osmond and is trying to get Madame Merle to help him marry his darling girl. Through their story, we still have glimpses of Isabel's life and we learn that she's been now married for two years and that she lost a son who died six months after his birth. Isabel and her husband seems to disagree about everything and we learn she's unhappy.Henry James, who once conducted a very slow paced - almost contemplative - narrative, gradually started to accelerate it, adding drama and a sense of urgency to his words. Right after an unsettling argument with Osmond one evening, Isabel, now feeling more distraught than ever, starts pondering and analyzing the many circumstances she finds herself in. The author immerses us in a deeply personal and intensely psychological account of her thoughts and emotions. Among the things Isabel reflected upon for a long time were the conclusion that her husband must hate her and the realization that Osmond had gained total control of her - the once independent and strong witted woman was now a subjugated spirit; the woman who once seemed to be against doing what was expected of her was now conforming to her husband's decisions. \"When the clock struck four she got up; she was going to bed at last, for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets.\"Complicating things even further is the revelation Countess Gemini - Osmond's sister - makes to Isabel of a long time secret, that leaves her completely shaken. This only comes to deteriorate even more her relationship with Gilbert. Now, fully aware of the situation she was put in through manipulations and schemes, Isabel is faced with a big decision: her cousin Ralph is dying in Gardencourt and her dictatorial husband is completely against her visiting England. Showing the old Isabel may still be somewhere locked inside of herself, she confronts her husband and leaves to be with her cousin.The Portrait of a Lady, through its length, presents a number of opposites, but the most striking ones are the battles between freedom vs. destiny and affection vs. betrayal. In the book's final moments, we witness that Isabel is offered a way to go back to where and to whom she was when she first came to Europe: \"The world's all before us - and the world's very big\", she is told. She could once again explore life and fill herself with hopes - but declined the opportunity: \"The world's very small\", she answered. With a much talked about conclusion that has both fascinated and infuriated - another battle of opposites? - readers, James' ending remains open to a lot of interpretations.It's disturbing to watch an unhappily married woman with an opportunity to leave it all behind - and the means to do it - simply not choosing freedom. Did Osmond finally accomplish to shatter her spirit? Another theory is that maybe marriage was an unbreakable vow and she felt she had a moral duty to her husband. Or was she trying to be protective of Pansy - who was mirroring Isabel's unhappiness and was another example of a woman who seemed to think that she was obliged to follow other's decisions even if it made her unhappy - and determined to stand by her side and not let the same happen to her step daughter? Innumerable possibilities...James has been known for structuring his novels with a series of circles surrounding a center. With that in mind, a hopeful interpretation of the book's ending is that, in order to complete that circle, Isabel must return to her husband, properly end her marriage so she could once again be able to start anew and free her spirit once and for all.Rating: for such an interesting and comprehensive analysis of freedom, human consciousness and ultimately, existentialism: 4 stars."], ["Book Review\n\n3+ out of 5 stars for The Portrait of a Lady, a classic story called the \"Great American Novel,\" written by Henry James in 1881. I adore Henry James and found great enjoyment in his literary works when I began reading him in my freshmen year at college. As an English major, I was exposed to many different authors, but I felt a strong connection with him and this literary period. American realistic works spoke to me above any of the other \"classic\" books I had been reading. As a result, I chose Henry James as the primary focus of an independent study course I'd taken in my senior year. I read 6 or 7 of his books during those 3 months and am going back now to provide quick reviews, as not everyone finds him as enjoyable as I do. I also don't want to bore everyone with a lengthy review on how to interpret him or his books.The Portrait of a Lady tells the story of a young woman who years to have her own life and make her own mark on the world. She doesn't want to be contained by marriage or the structure in place at the time in the late 19th century. She has different characteristics coming from American, English and continental European female archetypes. She has strong moral and ethical values. She knows who she is, yet she does not know all. As she moves through life, she makes choices that are not easy for her to execute. What I loved about this work is its deep exploratory view points, beautiful language and unparalleled characters. Though I only give it a 3, when compared to some of this other works, I would recommend you read a few chapters or sections, just to see if it is something you could find yourself getting lost in.The impact you feel upon reading this book is questioning what is the true view of a lady, how is she different from generation to generate, location to location and societal class to societal class. James knows women. He is very accurate on many levels... wrong on a few, too. But to put out his thoughts, in a huge tome, at a time when women were beginning to get more rights... and be able to cross genres and genders... is amazing. It's less about what he says and more about how he says it. And that's why I enjoy reading him... but even I admit, I can only take 1 book every few years! :)\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Isabel Archer is a young American lady, for whom the novel is titled, who is adventurous and very independent. She turns down two marriage proposals in the 1st half of the book to preserve her independence, one from Casper Goodwood, a young wealthy American, and one from Lord Warburton, a wealthy English aristocrat. When her English uncle dies, she inherits a large sum of money and travels with her aunt, Mrs. Touchett, to her Italian villa where she eventually meets, falls in love with, and marries Gilbert Osmond. All of her family and friends try to dissuade her from this, but to no avail, and she finally learns that Osmond doesn't love her, married her for her money, and to own her as another of his possessions.

I won\u2019t bore readers with another summary of the story; they\u2019re abundant on this site. I will say that with Isabel Archer, James earns his place in the canon with a proto-feminist (yes, I said it, proto-feminist) novel of a remarkable, if hard to describe heroine, who is faithful to her idea(l)s, rejects the affections of strong (but good) men, and suffers unnecessarily at the hands of a Machiavellian cad and an equally manipulative woman. If you don\u2019t like long novels\u2014avoid this one like a plague. If you don\u2019t like novels written in style from another era, get thee hence! If wordy, complicated sentences are anathema to you, you\u2019ve probably already stopped reading this mini-review.If I were to advise a reader at all, I\u2019d suggest reading it in as short a period as you can. Bite the bullet, finish it off keeping as much in mind as you can. I\u2019d also advise reading it on a Kindle (for the built-in dictionary) or, at the very least, keep a dictionary at hand. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have; and if you don\u2019t\u2014if you read the wrong book for you (this one), please, please, don\u2019t say James is an idiot (or some equivalent) or that the book is just boring (or some equivalent)\u2014instead, face the fact, you read the wrong book."]], "review_count": "4", "description": "When Isabel Archer, a beautiful, spirited American, is brought to Europe by her wealthy Aunt Touchett, it is expected that she will soon marry.
